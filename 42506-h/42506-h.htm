<p><span class="sc">The chronicles of holinshed</span> having become exceedingly
scarce, and, from their Rarity and Value, having always brought a high
Price whenever they have appeared for Sale, the Publishers have thought
they should perform an acceptable Service to the Public by reprinting
them in a uniform, handsome, and modern Form.</p>

<p>It cannot now be necessary to state the Importance and interesting Nature
of this Work. The high Price for which it has always sold, is a sufficient
Testimony of the Esteem in which it has been held. Holinshed's Description
of Britain is allowed to contain the most curious and authentic Account
of the Manners and Customs of our Island in the Reign of Henry VIII.
and Elizabeth, in which it was written. His History of the Transactions
of the British Isles, during these Periods, possesses all the Force and
Value of contemporary Evidence, collected by a most skilful Observer;
and the peculiar Style and Orthography in which the Work is written,
furnish a very interesting Document to illustrate the History of the English
Language.</p>

<p>The original Edition of the Chronicles of Holinshed, it is well known, was
published by their Author in a mutilated State. A Number of Pages,
which had obviously been printed with the rest of the Work, were found
to be omitted, except in a few Copies obtained by some favoured Persons.
In the present Edition, these Castrations are faithfully restored; and in
order that the Purchaser may depend upon finding an exact as well as a
perfect Copy, it has been a Law with the Publishers, not to alter a single
Letter, but to print the Work with the utmost Fidelity from the best preceding
Edition, with the Author's own Orthography, and with his marginal
Notes. The only Liberty taken, has been to use the Types of the present
Day, instead of the old English Letter of the Time of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The Publishers submit to the Public this Edition of a curious and
valuable Chronicle of our History, with a confident Hope, that it will
gratify both the Historical Student and the General Reader. If it meet with
the Reception which they anticipate, they will be encouraged to select
some others of the rarest and most important of our ancient Chronicles,
and reprint them, in like Manner, for the Convenience and Gratification of
the Public.</p>

<h3 class="space-above">TO THE<br />

RIGHT HONORABLE, AND HIS SINGULAR GOOD LORD AND MAISTER,<br />

<big><em>S. WILLIAM BROOKE KNIGHT</em>,</big></h3>

<p class="indent1"><span class="sc">
<span class="outdent">lord warden</span> of the cinque ports, and baron of cobham, all
increase of the feare and knowledge of god, firme obedience
toward his prince, infallible loue to the common wealth,
and commendable renowme here in this world, and in the
world to come life euerlasting.
</span></p>

<hr />

<p>Hauing had iust occasion, Right Honorable, to remaine in London,
during the time of Trinitie terme last passed, and being earnestlie required
of diuers my freends, to set downe some breefe discourse of parcell of those
things, which I had obserued in the reading of such manifold antiquities as
I had perused toward the furniture of a Chronologie, which I haue yet in
hand; I was at the first verie loth to yeeld to their desires: first, for that I
thought my selfe vnable for want of skill and iudgment, so suddenlie &amp; with
so hastie speed to take such a charge vpon me: secondlie, bicause the dealing
therein might prooue an hinderance and impechment vnto mine owne
Treatise: and finallie, for that I had giuen ouer all earnest studie of
histories,
as iudging the time spent about the same, to be an hinderance vnto
my more necessarie dealings in that vocation &amp; function wherevnto I am
called in the ministerie. But when they were so importunate with me,
that no reasonable excuse could serue to put by this trauell, I condescended
at the length vnto their yrkesome sute, promising that I would spend such
void time as I had to spare, whilest I should be inforced to tarie in the citie,
vpon some thing or other that should satisfie their request; and stand
in lieu of a description of my Countrie. For their parts also they assured
me of such helps as they could purchase: and thus with hope of
<span class="page"><a name="pagevi" id="pagevi"></a>[Page vi]</span>
good, although no gaie successe, I went in hand withall, then almost as one
leaning altogither vnto memorie, sith my books and I were parted by fourtie
miles in sunder. In this order also I spent a part of Michaelmas and Hilarie
termes insuing, being inforced thereto I say by other businesses which compelled
me to keepe in the citie, and absent my selfe from my charge, though
in the meane season I had some repaire vnto my poore librarie, but not
so great as the dignitie of the matter required, and yet far greater than the
Printers hast would suffer. One helpe, and none of the smallest that I obtained
herein, was by such commentaries as <em>Leland</em> had somtime collected
of the state of Britaine, books vtterlie mangled, defaced with wet and weather,
and finallie vnperfect through want of sundrie volumes: secondlie, I
gat some knowledge of things by letters and pamphlets, from sundrie places
&amp; shires of England, but so discordant now and then amongst themselues,
especiallie in the names and courses of riuers and situation of townes, that I
had oft greater trouble to reconcile them one with an other, than orderlie
to pen the whole discourse of such points as they contained: the third
aid did grow by conference with diuers, either at the table or secretlie
alone, wherein I marked in what things the talkers did agree, and wherin
they impugned ech other, choosing in the end the former, and reiecting the
later, as one desirous to set foorth the truth absolutelie, or such things in
deed as were most likelie to be true. The last comfort arose by mine owne
reading of such writers as haue heretofore made mention of the condition of
our countrie, in speaking wherof, if I should make account of the successe,
&amp; extraordinarie c&#333;ming by sundrie treatises not supposed to be extant, I
should but seeme to pronounce more than may well be said with modestie,
&amp; say farder of my selfe than this Treatise can beare witnes of. Howbeit, I
refer not this successe wholie vnto my purpose about this Description, but
rather giue notice thereof to come to passe in the penning of my Chronologie,
whose crums as it were fell out verie well in the framing of this Pamphlet.
In the processe therefore of this Booke, if your Honor regard the
substance of that which is here declared, I must needs confesse that it is
none of mine owne: but if your Lordship haue consideration of the barbarous
<span class="page"><a name="pagevii" id="pagevii"></a>[Page vii]</span>
composition shewed herein, that I may boldlie claime and challenge for
mine owne, sith there is no man of any so slender skill, that will defraud me
of that reproch, which is due vnto me for the meere negligence, disorder,
and euill disposition of matter comprehended in the same. Certes I protest
before God and your Honour, that I neuer made any choise of stile, or
words, neither regarded to handle this Treatise in such precise order and
method as manie other would haue done, thinking it sufficient, truelie and
plainelie to set foorth such things as I minded to intreat of, rather than with
vaine affectation of eloquence to paint out a rotten sepulchre; a thing
neither commendable in a writer, nor profitable to the reader. How
other affaires troubled me in the writing hereof manie know, and peraduenture
the slacknesse shewed herein can better testifie: but howsoeuer
it be done, &amp; whatsoeuer I haue done, I haue had an especiall eye
vnto the truth of things, and for the rest, I hope that this foule frizeled
Treatise of mine will prooue a spur to others better learned, more skilfull
in Chorographie, and of greater iudgement in choise of matter to handle the
selfe same argument, if in my life time I doo not peruse it againe. It is
possible also that your Honour will mislike hereof, for that I haue not by
mine owne trauell and eysight viewed such things as I doo here intreat of.
In deed I must needs confesse, that vntill now of late, except it were from
the parish where I dwell, vnto your Honour in Kent; or out of London
where I was borne, vnto Oxford &amp; Cambridge where I haue bene brought
vp, I neuer trauelled 40. miles foorthright and at one iourney in all my
life; neuerthelesse in my report of these things, I vse their authorities, who
either haue performed in their persons, or left in writing vpon sufficient
ground (as I said before) whatsoeuer is wanting in mine. It may be in like
sort that your Honour will take offense at my rash and retchlesse behauiour
vsed in the composition of this volume, and much more that being scambled
vp after this maner, I dare presume to make tendour of the protection
therof vnto your Lordships hands. But when I consider the singular affection
that your Honour dooth beare to those that in any wise will trauell
to set foorth such profitable things as lie hidden, and therevnto doo weigh
<span class="page"><a name="pageviii" id="pageviii"></a>[Page viii]</span>
on mine owne behalfe my bounden dutie and gratefull mind to such a one
as hath so manie and sundrie waies benefited me that otherwise can make
no recompense, I can not but cut off all such occasion of doubt, and therevpon
exhibit it, such as it is, and so penned as it is, vnto your Lordships
tuition, vnto whome if it may seeme in anie wise acceptable, I haue my
whole desire. And as I am the first that (notwithstanding the great repugnancie
to be seene among our writers) hath taken vpon him so particularlie
to describe this Ile of Britaine; so I hope the learned and godlie will beare
withall, &amp; reforme with charitie where I doo tread amisse. As for the curious,
and such as can rather euill fauouredlie espie than skilfullie correct
an error, and sooner carpe at another mans dooings than publish any
thing of their owne, (keeping themselues close with an obscure admiration
of learning &amp; knowledge among the common sort) I force not what they
saie hereof: for whether it doo please or displease them, all is one to me,
sith I referre my whole trauell in the gratification of your Honour, and
such as are of experience to consider of my trauell, and the large scope of
things purposed in this Treatise, of whome my seruice in this behalfe may
be taken in good part, that I will repute for my full recompense, and large
guerdon of my labours. The Almightie God preserue your Lordship in
continuall health, wealth, and prosperitie, with my good Ladie your wife,
your Honours children, (whom God hath indued with a singular towardnesse
vnto all vertue and learning) and the rest of your reformed familie,
vnto whom I wish farder increase of his holie spirit, vnderstanding of his
word, augmentation of honor, and continuance of zeale to follow his
commandements.</p>

<small>OF THE DIUISION OF THE WHOLE EARTH.</small><br />

CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">Noah first diuided the earth among his sonnes.</span>
We read that the earth hath beene diuided into thrée parts, euen sithens
the generall floud. And the common opinion is, that Noah limited and
bestowed it vpon his three sons, Japhet, Cham, and Sem, preserued with
him in the Arke, giuing vnto each of them such portions thereof as to
him séemed good, and neuerthelesse reteining the souereigntie of the
whole still vnto himselfe: albeit as yet it be left vncertaine how those
seuerall parts were bounded, and from whome they tooke such names as in
our times are attributed to each of them. Certes the words, Asia,
Europa, and Africa, are denominations giuen but of late (to speake of)
vnto them, and it is to be doubted, whether sithens the time of Noah,
the sea hath in sundrie places wonne or lost, added or diminished to and
from each of them; or whether Europa, and Lybia were but one portion;
and the same westerlie regions of late discouered (and now called
America,) was the third part (counting Asia for the second) or the selfe
region of the Atlantides, which Plato and others, for want of traffike
thither in their times, supposed to be dissolued and sunke into the sea:
as by their writings appeereth.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The diuision of the earth not yet certeinlie knowne.</span>
Not long before my time, we reckoned Asia, Europa, and Africa, for a
full and perfect diuision of the whole earth, which are parcels onelie
of that huge Iland that lieth east of the Atlantike sea, and whereof the
first is diuided from the second by Tanais (which riseth in the rocks of
Caucasus, and hideth it selfe in the Meotine moores) and the Ocean sea;
and the last from them both by the Mediterrane and red sea, otherwise
called Mare Erythræum. But now all men, especially the learned, begin to
doubt of the soundnes of that partition; bicause a no lesse part than
the greatest of the thrée ioined with those Ilands and maine which lie
vnder the north and Southpoles, if not double in quantitie vnto the
same, are found out and discouered by the diligence of our trauellers.
Hereby it appeereth, that either the earth was not exactlie diuided in
time past by antiquitie; or els, that the true diuision thereof came not
to the hands and notice of their posteritie, so that our ancestors haue
hitherto as it were laboured in the Cimmerian darkenesse, and were
vtterlie ignorant of the truth of that whereabout they indeuoured to
shew their trauels and knowledge in their writings. Some peece of this
confusion also is to be found amongst the ancient and Romane writers,
who (notwithstanding their large conquests) did sticke in the same mire
with their successors, not being able (as appeereth by their treatises)
to deliuer and set  downe the veritie. For Salust in his booke De
<span class="leftnote">Variance among the writers about the
diuision of the earth.</span>
bello Iugurthino cannot tell whether Africa be parcell of Asia or not.
And with the same scruple Varro in his booke De lingua Lat. is not a
litle incumbred, who in the end concludeth, that the whole earth is
diuided into Asia and Europa: so that Africa is excluded and driuen out
of his place. Silius also writeth of Africa, (as one not yet resolued
wherevnto to leane,) that it is;</p>

<p class="ind1">Aut ingens Asiæ latus, aut pars tertia rerum.</p>

<p><span class="page"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[Page 3]</span></p>

<p>Wherein Lucane lib. 9. sheweth himselfe to be far of another iudgement,
in that he ascribeth it to Europa, saieng after this maner:</p>

<p class="ind1">Tertia pars rerum Lybia: si credere famæ<br />
Cuncta velis, si ventos c&oelig;lúmque sequaris,<br />
Pars erit Europæ, nec enim plus littora Nili<br />
Quàm Scythicus Tanais primis à gradibus absunt.</p>

<p>Whereby (I saie) we may well vnderstand, that in the time of Augustus
Tiberius, Claudius &amp; Nero, the Romanes were not yet resolued of the
diuision of the earth. For my part, as I indeuour not to remooue the
credit of that which antiquitie hath deliuered (and yet loth to continue
and maintaine any corruption that may be redressed) so I thinke good to
<span class="leftnote">The earth diuided into fiue parts, whereas <em>Belforest</em>
hath but foure, in <em>Prefat. lib. 4.</em></span>
giue foorth a new diuision more probable, &amp; better agreeing with a
truth. And therefore I diuide the whole into fiue seuerall parcels,
reteining the common diuision in the first three, as before; and vnto
the fourth allowing not onelie all that portion that lieth by north of
the Magellan streicts, and those Hyperborean Ilands which lie west of
the line of longitude, of late discouered by Frobisher, and called by
hir Maiestie Meta incognita: but likewise so manie Ilands as are within
180. degrees Westwards from our beginning or common line of longitude,
whereby they are parted from those, which by this diuision are allotted
vnto Asia, and the portion it selfe made equipollent with the same for
greatnes, and far excéeding either Europa or Africa, if it be not fullie
so much in quantitie as they both vnited and laid togither. The fift &amp;
last part is the Antartike portion with hir Ilands annexed, that region
(I meane) which lieth vnder the South pole, cut off from America, or the
fourth part by the Magellan streicts; &amp; from Africa by the sea which
<span class="leftnote">Cape di bona Speranza.</span>
passeth by the Cape of good hope; a countrie no lesse large for limits
and bounds than Africa or America, and therefore right worthie to be
called the fift: howsoeuer it shall please the curious to mislike of
this diuision. This also I will adde, that albeit the continent hereof
doo not extend it selfe vnto the verie Antartike point, but lieth as it
<span class="leftnote">The forme of the fift part.</span>
were a long table betwéene two seas, of which the later is vnder the
South poole, and as I may call it a maine sea vnder the aforesaid
pricke, yet is it not without sundrie Ilands also adjoining vnto it, and
the inner most sea not destitute of manie, as by experience hath béene
of late confirmed. Furthermore, whereas our describers of the earth haue
made it such in their descriptions, as hath reached litle or nothing
into the peaceable sea without the Antartike circle: it is now found by
Theuet and others, that it extendeth it selfe northwards into that
trace, by no small number of leagues, euen in maner to the Equator, in
so much that the westerlie part thereof from America, is supposed to
reach northward so far from the Antartike article, as Africa dooth
southwards from the tropike of Cancer, which is no small portion of
ground; &amp; I maruell why not obserued by such as heretofore haue written
of the same. But they excuse themselues by the ingratitude of the
Portingals and Spaniards, who haue of purpose concealed manie things
found out in their trauell, least they should séeme to open a gap by
dooing otherwise, for strangers to enter into their conquests. As for
those Ilands also which lie in the peaceable sea, scattered here and
there, as Iaua the greater, the lesser Sumatra, Iapan, Burneo, &amp;c: with
a number of other, I refer them still unto Asia, as before, so as they
be without the compasse of 90. degrees eastward from the line of
longitude, &amp; not aboue 180. as I doo the Ile of S. Laurence, and a
number of other vnto Africa within the said proportion, wishing so
little alteration as I may: and yet not yeelding vnto any confusion,
whereby the truth of the diuision should hereafter be impeached.</p>

<p>And whereas by Virgil (speaking of our Iland) saith;</p>

<p class="ind1">Et penitùs toto diuisos orbe Britannos,</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Unto what portion Britaine is referred.</span>
And some other authors not vnworthie to be read and perused, it is not
certeine vnto which portion of the earth our Ilands, and Thule, with
sundrie the like scattered in the north seas should be ascribed, bicause
they excluded them (as you sée) from the rest of the whole earth: I have
<span class="page"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[Page 4]</span>
thought good, for facilitie sake of diuision, to refer them all which
lie within the first minute of longitude, set downe by Ptolome, to
Europa, and that as reason requireth: so that the aforesaid line shall
henceforth be their Meta &amp; partition from such as are to be ascribed to
America; albeit they come verie neere vnto the aforesaid portion, &amp; may
otherwise (without prejudice) be numbred with the same. It may be that
some will thinke this my dealing either to be superfluous, or to procéed
from (I wot not what) foolish curiositie: for the world is now growne to
be very apt and readie to iudge the hardest of euerie attempt. But
forsomuch as my purpose is to leaue a plaine report of such matter as I
doo write of, and deliuer such things as I intreat of in distinct and
vpright order; though method now and then doo faile, I will go forward
with my indeuour, referring the examination of my dooings to the
indifferent and learned eare, without regard what the other doo conceiue
and imagine of me. In the meane season therefore it shall suffice to say
at this time, that Albion as the mother, and the rest of the Ilands as
hir daughters, lieng east of the line of longitude, be still ascribed
vnto Europa: wherevnto some good authours heretofore in their writings,
&amp; their owne proper or naturall situations also haue not amisse referred
them.</p>

<small>OF THE POSITION, CIRCUIT, FORME, AND QUANTITIE OF THE ILE OF BRITAINE.</small><br />

CAP. II.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">How Britaine lieth from the maine.</span>
Britannia or Britain, as we now terme it in our English toong, or
Brutania as some pronounce it (by reason of the letter y in the first
syllable of the word, as antiquitie did sometime deliuer it) is an Ile
lieng in the Ocean sea, directlie ouer against that part of France which
conteineth Picardie, Normandie, and thereto the greatest part of little
Britaine, which later region was called in time past Armorica, of the
situation thereof vpon the sea coast, vntill such time as a companie of
Britons (either led ouer by some of the Romane Emperours, or flieng
thither from the tyrannie of such as oppressed them here in this Iland)
did setle themselues there, and called it Britaine, after the name of
their owne countrie, from whence they aduentured thither. It hath
Ireland vpon the west side, on the north the maine sea, euen to Thule
and the Hyperboreans; and on the east side also the Germane Ocean, by
which we passe dailie through the trade of merchandize, not onlie into
the low countries of Belgie, now miserablie afflicted betwéene the
Spanish power and popish inquisition (as spice betweene the morter and
the pestell) but also into Germanie, Friezeland, Denmarke, and Norwaie,
carrieng from hence thither, and bringing from thence hither, all such
necessarie commodities as the seuerall countries doo yeeld: through
which meanes, and besides common amitie conserued, traffike is
mainteined, and the necessitie of each partie abundantlie reléeued.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The longitude and latitude of this Ile.</span>
It conteineth in longitude taken by the middest of the region 19.
degrees exactlie: and in latitude 53. degrées, and thirtie min. after
the opinions of those that haue diligentlie obserued the same in our
daies, and the faithfull report of such writers as haue left notice
thereof vnto vs, in their learned treatises to be perpetuallie
remembred. Howbeit, whereas some in setting downe of these two lines,
haue seemed to varie about the placing of the same, each of them
diuerslie remembring the names of sundrie cities and townes, whereby
they affirme them to haue their seuerall courses: for my part I haue
thought good to procéed somewhat after another sort; that is, by
diuiding the latest and best chards each way into two equall parts (so
neere as I can possiblie bring the same to passe) wherby for the
<span class="leftnote">Longest day.</span>
middle of latitude, I product Caerlile and Newcastell vpon Tine, (whose
longest day consisteth of sixteene houres, 48. minuts) and for the
longitude, Newberie, Warwike, Sheffield, Skipton, &amp;c: which dealing, in
mine opinion, is most easie and indifferent, and likeliest meane to come
by the certeine standing and situation of our Iland.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[Page 5]</span></p>

<p><span class="rightnote">The compasse of Britaine.</span>
Touching the length and bredth of the same, I find some variance amongst
writers: for after some, there are from the Piere or point of Douer,
vnto the farthest part of Cornewall westwards 320. miles: from thence
againe to the point of Cathnesse by the Irish sea 800. Wherby Polydore
and other doo gather, that the circuit of the whole Iland of Britaine is
1720. miles, which is full 280. lesse than Cæsar dooth set downe, except
there be some difference betwéene the Romane and British miles, as there
is indeed; wherof hereafter I may make some farther conference.</p>

<p>Martianus writing of the bredth of Britaine, hath onlie 300. miles, but
Orosius hath 1200. in the whole compasse. Ethicus also agreeing with
Plinie, Martianus, and Solinus, hath 800. miles of length, but in the
breadth he commeth short of their account by 120. miles. In like maner
Dion in Seuero maketh the one of 891. miles: but the other; to wit,
where it is broadest, of 289. and where it is narrowest, of 37. Finally,
Diodorus Siculus affirmeth the south coast to conteine 7000. furlongs,
the second; to wit, à Carione ad Promontorium 15000. the third 20000.
and the whole circuit to consist of 42000. But in our time we reckon the
breadth from Douer to Cornewall, not to be aboue 300. miles, and the
length from Douer to Cathnesse, no more than 500. which neuerthelesse
must be measured by a right line, for otherwise I see not how the said
diuision can hold.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The forme.</span>
The forme and fashion of this Ile is thrée-cornered, as some have
deuised, like vnto a triangle, bastard sword, wedge, or partesant, being
broadest in the south part, and gathering still narrower and narrower,
till it come to the farthest point of Cathnesse northward, where it is
narrowest of all, &amp; there endeth in maner of a promontorie called
Caledonium &amp; Orchas in British Morwerydh, which is not aboue 30. miles
ouer, as dailie experience by actuall trauell dooth confirme.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Promontories of Britaine.</span>
The old writers giue vnto the thrée principall corners, crags, points,
and promontories of this Iland, thrée seuerall names. As vnto that of
Kent, Cantium, that of Cornewall, Hellenes, and of Scotland, Caledonium,
and Orchas; and these are called principall, in respect of the other,
which are Taruisium, Nonantum, Epidium, Gangacum, Octapites, Herculeum,
Antiuesteum, Ocrinum, Berubium, Taizalum, Acantium, &amp;c: of which I
thought good also to leaue this notice, to the end that such as shall
come after, may thereby take occasion to seeke out their true places,
wherof as yet I am in maner ignorant, I meane for the most part; bicause
I haue no sound author that dooth leade mée to their knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The distance from the maine.</span>
Furthermore, the shortest and most vsuall cut that we haue out of our
Iland to the maine, is from Douer (the farthest part of Kent eastward)
unto Calice a towne in Picardie 1300. miles from Rome, in old time
called Petressa and Scalas, though some like better of blacknesse where
the breadth of the sea is not aboue thirtie miles. Which course, as it
is now frequented and vsed for the most common and safe passage of such
as come into our countrie out of France and diuers other realms, so it
hath not beene vnknowne of old time vnto the Romans, who for the most
part vsed these two hauens for their passage and repassage to and fro;
although we finde, that now and then diuerse of them came also from
Bullen, and landed at Sandwich, or some other places of the coast more
toward the west, or betweene Hide and Lid; to wit, Romneie marsh, (which
in old time was called Romania or Romanorum insula) as to auoid the
force of the wind &amp; weather, that often molesteth seafaringmen in these
narrowe seas, best liked them for their safegards. Betweene the part of
Holland also, which lieth néere the mouth of the Rhene and this our
Iland, are 900. furlongs, as Sosimus saith; and besides him, diuers
other writers, which being conuerted into English miles, doo yeeld 112.
and foure od furlongs, whereby the iust distance of the neerest part of
Britaine, from that part of the maine also, dooth certeinlie appéere to
be much lesse than the common maps of our countrie haue hitherto set
downe.</p>

<small>OF THE ANCIENT NAMES OR DENOMINATIONS OF THIS ILAND.</small><br />

CAP. III.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">Dis, Samothes.</span>
In the diligent perusall of their treatises, who haue written of the
state of this our Iland, I find that at the first it séemed to be a
parcell of the Celtike kingdome, whereof Dis otherwise called Samothes,
one of the sonnes of Japhet was the Saturne or originall beginner, and
of him thencefoorth for a long while called Samothea. Afterward in
processe of time, when desire of rule began to take hold in the minds of
men, and ech prince endeuoured to enlarge his owne dominions: Albion the
<span class="leftnote">Neptunus Marioticus.</span>
sonne of Neptune, Amphitrite surnamed Marioticus (bicause his dominions
laie among the ilands of the Mediterran sea, as those of Plutus did on
the lower grounds neere vnto shore, as contrariwise his father Jupiter
dwelled on the high hils néerer to heauen) hearing of the commodities of
<span class="leftnote">The first conquest of Britaine.</span>
the countrie, and plentifulnesse of soile here, made a voiage ouer, and
finding the thing not onelie correspondent vnto, but also farre
surmounting the report that went of this Iland, it was not long after
yer he inuaded the same by force of armes, brought it to his subiection
in the 29. yeare after his grandfathers decease, and finallie changed
the name thereof into Albion, whereby the former denomination after
Samothes did grow out of mind, and fall into vtter forgetfulnesse. And
thus was this Iland bereft at on time both of hir ancient name, and also
of hir lawfull succession of princes descended of the line of Japhet,
<span class="leftnote">Britaine under the Celts 341. yeares.</span>
vnder whom it had continued by the space of 341. yeres and nine princes,
as by the Chronologie following shall easilie appeere.</p>

<p>Goropius our neighbor being verie nice in the denomination of our Iland,
as in most other points of his huge volume of the originall of Antwarpe
lib. 6. (whom Buchanan also followeth in part) is brought into great
doubt, whether Britaine was called Albion of the word Alb, white; or Alp
an hill; as Bodinus is no lesse troubled with fetching the same ab
Oibijs, or as he wresteth it, ab Albijs gallis. But here his
inconstancie appeareth, in that in his Gotthadamca liber. 7. he taketh
no lesse paines to bring the Britaines out of Denmarke, whereby the name
of the Iland should be called Vridania, Freedania, Brithania, or
Bridania, tanquam libera Dania, as another also dooth to fetch the
originall out of Spaine, where Breta signifieth soile or earth. But as
such as walke in darkenesse doo often straie, bicause they wot not
whither they go: euen so doo these men, whilest they séeke to extenuate
the certeintie of our histories, and bring vs altogither to
uncerteinties &amp; their coniectures. They in like maner, which will haue
the Welshmen come from the French with this one question, vnde Walli
nisi a Gallis, or from some Spanish colonie, doo greatlie bewraie their
oversights; but most of all they erre that endeuour to fetch it from
Albine the imagined daughter of a forged Dioclesian, wherewith our
ignorant writers haue of late not a little stained our historie, and
brought the sound part thereof into some discredit and mistrust: but
more of this hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Neptune God of the sea.</span>
Now to speake somewhat also of Neptune as by the waie (sith I haue made
mention of him in this place) it shall not be altogither impertinent.
Wherfore you shall vnderstand, that for his excellent knowledge in the
art of nauigation (as nauigation then went) he was reputed the most
skilfull prince that liued in his time. And therfore, and likewise for
his courage &amp; boldnesse in aduenturing to and fro, he was after his
decease honoured as a god, and the protection of such as trauelled by
<span class="leftnote">The maner of dressing of ships in old time.</span>
sea committed to his charge. So rude also was the making of ships
wherewith to saile in his time (which were for the most part flat
bottomed and broad) that for lacke of better experience to calke and
trim the same after they were builded, they vsed to naile them ouer with
rawe hides of bulles, buffles, and such like, and with such a kind of
nauie (as they say) first Samothes, &amp; then Albion arriued in this Iland,
which vnto me doth not séeme a thing impossible. The northerlie or
artike regions, doo not naile their ships with iron, which they vtterly
want, but with wooden pins, or els they bind the planks togither verie
artificiallie with bast ropes, osiers, rinds of trées, or twigs of
<span class="page"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[Page 7]</span>
popler, the substance of those vessels being either of fir or pine, sith
oke is verie deintie &amp; hard to be had amongst them. Of their wooden
anchors I speake not (which neuerthelesse are common to them, and to the
Gothlanders) more than of ships wrought of wickers, sometime vsed in our
Britaine, and couered with leather euen in the time of Plinie, lib. 7.
cap. 56. as also botes made of rushes and réeds, &amp;c. Neither haue I iust
occasion to speake of ships made of canes, of which sort Staurobates,
king of India fighting against Semiramis, brought 4000. with him and
fought with hir the first battell on the water that euer I read of, and
vpon the riuer Indus, but to his losse, for he was ouercome by hir
power, &amp; his nauie either drowned or burned by the furie of hir
souldiers.</p>

<p>But to proceed, when the said Albion had gouerned here in this countrie
by the space of seauen yeares, it came to passe that both he and his
brother Bergion were killed by Hercules at the mouth of Rhodanus, as the
said Hercules passed out of Spaine by the Celtes to go ouer into Italie,
and vpon this occasion (as I gather among the writers) not vnworthie to
<span class="leftnote">Lestrigo.</span>
be remembred. It happened in time of Lucus king of the Celts, that
Lestrigo and his issue (whom Osyris his grandfather had placed ouer the
<span class="leftnote">Janigenes were the posteritie of Noah in Italie.</span>
Janigenes) did exercise great tyrannie, not onelie ouer his owne
kingdome, but also in molestation of such princes as inhabited round
about him in most intollerable maner. Moreouer he was not a little
incouraged in these his dooings by Neptune his father, who thirsted
<span class="rightnote">Neptune had xxxiii. sonnes.</span>
greatly to leaue his xxxiii. sonnes settled in the mightiest kingdoms of
the world, as men of whom he had alreadie conceiued this opinion, that
if they had once gotten foot into any region whatsoeuer, it would not be
long yer they did by some meanes or other, not onelie establish their
seats, but also increase their limits to the better maintenance of
themselues and their posteritie for euermore. To be short therefore,
after the giants, and great princes, or mightie men of the world had
conspired and slaine the aforsaid Osyris, onlie for that he was an
obstacle vnto them in their tyrannous dealing; Hercules his sonne,
surnamed Laabin, Lubim, or Libius, in the reuenge of his fathers death,
proclaimed open warres against them all, and going from place to place,
he ceased not to spoile their kingdomes, and therewithall to kill them
with great courage that fell into his hands. Finallie, hauing among
<span class="leftnote">Lomnimi. Geriones.</span>
sundrie other ouercome the Lomnimi or Geriones in Spaine, and
vnderstanding that Lestrigo and his sonnes did yet remaine in Italie, he
directed his viage into those parts, and taking the kingdome of the
Celts in his waie, he remained for a season with Lucus the king of that
countrie, where he also maried his daughter Galathea, and begat a sonne
<span class="leftnote">Galathea. Galates, or Kelts.</span>
by hir, calling him after his mothers name Galates, of whom in my said
Chronologie I haue spoken more at large.</p>

<p>In the meane time Albion vnderstanding how Hercules intended to make
warres against his brother Lestrigo, he thought good if it were possible
<span class="leftnote">Bergion.</span>
to stop him that tide, and therefore sending for his brother Bergion out
of the Orchades (where he also reigned as supreame <span class="leftnote"><em>Pomponius
Mela cap. de Gallia.</em></span> lord and gouernour) they ioined their powers, and
sailed ouer into France. Being arriued there, it was not long yer they
met with Hercules and his armie, neare vnto the mouth of the riuer
called Roen (or the Rhodanus) where happened a cruell conflict betwéene
them, in which Hercules and his men were like to haue lost the day, for
that they were in maner wearied with long warres, and their munition
sore wasted in the last viage that he had made for Spaine. Herevpon
Hercules perceiuing the courages of his souldiours somewhat to abate,
and seeing the want of artillerie like to be the cause of his fatall
daie and present ouerthrowe at hand, it came suddenlie into his mind to
will each of them to defend himselfe by throwing stones at his enimie,
<span class="leftnote"><em>Strabo, lib. 4.</em></span>
whereof there laie great store then scattered in the place. The policie
was no sooner published than hearkened vnto and put in execution,
whereby they so preuailed in the end, that Hercules wan the field, their
enimies were put to flight, and Albion and his brother both slaine, and
buried in that plot. Thus was Britaine rid of a tyrant, Lucus king of
the Celts deliuered from an vsurper (that dailie incroched vpon him,
building sundrie cities and holds, of which some were placed among the
Alps &amp; called after his owne name, and other also euen in his owne
kingdome on that side) and Lestrigo greatlie weakened by the slaughter
of his brethren. Of this inuention of Hercules in like sort it commeth,
<span class="page"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[Page 8]</span>
that Jupiter father vnto Hercules (who indeed was none other but Osyris)
is feigned to throw downe stones from heauen vpon Albion and Bergion, in
the defense of his sonne: which came so thicke vpon them, as if great
drops of raine or haile should haue descended from aboue, no man well
knowing which waie to turne him from their force, they came so fast and
with so great a violence.</p>

<p>But to go forward, albeit that Albion and his power were thus
discomfited and slaine, yet the name that he gaue unto this Iland died
not, but still remained vnto the time of Brute, who arriuing héere in
the 1116. before Christ, and 2850. after the creation of the world, not
onelie changed it into Britaine (after it had beene called Albion, by
the space of about 600. yeares) but to declare his souereigntie ouer the
rest of the Ilands also that lie scattered round about it, he called
them all after the same maner, so that Albion was said in time to be
Britanniarum insula maxima, that is, The greatest of those Iles that
beare the name of Britaine, which Plinie also confirmeth, and Strabo in
his first and second bookes denieth not. There are some, which vtterlie
denieng that this Iland tooke hir name of Brute, doo affirme it rather
to be so called of the rich mettals sometime carried from the mines
there into all the world as growing in the same. Vibius Sequester also
saith that Calabria was sometime called Britannia, Ob immensam
affluentiam totius delitiæ atque vbertatis, that was to be found
heerein. Other contend that it should be written with P (Pritannia.) All
which opinions as I absolutelie denie not, so I willinglie leane vnto
none of them in peremptorie maner, sith the antiquitie of our historie
carrieth me withall vnto the former iudgements. And for the same cause I
reiect them also, which deriue the aforesaid denomination from Britona
the nymph, in following Textor (or Prutus or Prytus the sonne of Araxa)
which Britona was borne in Creta daughter to Mars, and fled by sea from
thence onelie to escape the villanie of Minos, who attempted to rauish
and make hir one of his paramours: but if I should forsake the
authoritie of Galfride, I would rather leane to the report of
Parthenius, whereof elsewhere I haue made a more large rehersall.</p>

<p>It is altogither impertinent, to discusse whether Hercules came into
this Iland after the death of Albion, or not, although that by an
ancient monument seene of late, as I heare, and the cape of Hartland or
Harcland in the West countrie (called Promontorium Herculis in old time)
diuers of our British antiquaries doo gather great likelihood that he
should also be here. But sith his presence or absence maketh nothing
with the alteration of the name of this our region and countrie, and to
search out whether the said monument was but some token erected in his
honour of later times (as some haue beene elsewhere, among the Celts
framed, &amp; those like an old criple with a bow bent in one hand &amp; a club
in the other, a rough skin on his backe, the haire of his head all to be
matted like that of the Irishmens, and drawing manie men captiue after
him in chaines) is but smallie auailable, and therefore I passe it ouer
as not incident to my purpose. Neither will I spend any time in the
determination, whether Britaine had beene sometime a parcell of the
maine, although it should well séeme so to haue beene, bicause that
before the generall floud of Noah, we doo not read of Ilands, more than
of hils and vallies. Wherfore as Wilden Arguis also noteth in his
philosophie and tractation of meteors, it is verie likelie that they
were onelie caused by the violent motion and working of the sea, in the
time of the floud, which if S. Augustine had well considered, he would
neuer haue asked how such creatures as liued in Ilands far distant from
the maine could come into the arke, De ciuit. lib. 16. cap. 7. howbeit
in the end he concludeth with another matter more profitable than his
demand.</p>

<p>As for the speedie and timelie inhabitation thereof, this is mine
opinion, to wit, that it was inhabited shortlie after the diuision of
the earth. For I read that when each capteine and his companie had their
portions assigned vnto them by Noah in the partition that he made of the
whole among his posteritie, they neuer ceased to trauell and search out
the vttermost parts of the same, vntill they found out their bounds
allotted, and had seene and vewed their limits, euen vnto the verie
poles. It shall suffice therefore onelie to haue touched these things in
this manner a farre off, and in returning to our purpose, to proceed
with the rest concerning the denomination of our Iland, which was knowne
<span class="page"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[Page 9]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Yet <em>Timeus</em>, <em>Ephorus</em>, and some of the Grecians,
know the name Britannia, as appeareth also by <em>Diodorus</em>, &amp;c.
before the comming of Cesar.</span>
vnto most of the Gréekes for a long time, by none other name than
Albion, and to saie the truth, euen vnto Alexanders daies, as appeareth
by the words of Aristotle in his De mundo, and to the time of Ptolomie:
notwithstanding that Brute, as I haue said, had changed the same into
Britaine, manie hundred yeares before.</p>

<p>After Brutus I doo not find that anie men attempted to change it againe,
vntill the time that Theodosius, in the daies of Valentinianus and
Valens endeuoured, in the remembrance of the two aforesaid Emperours, to
call it Valentia, as Marcellinus saith. But as this deuise tooke no hold
among the common sort, so it retained still the name of Britaine, vntill
the reigne of Ecbert, who about the 800. yeare of Grace, and first of
his reigne, gaue foorth an especiall edict, dated at Winchester, that it
should be called Angles land, or Angel-landt, for which in our time we
doo pronounce it England. And this is all (right honorable) that I haue
to say, touching the seuerall names of this Iland, vtterlie misliking in
the meane season their deuises, which make Hengist the onlie parent of
the later denomination, whereas Ecbert, bicause his ancestours descended
from the Angles one of the sixe nations that came with the Saxons into
Britaine (for they were not all of one, but of diuers countries, as
Angles, Saxons, Germans, Switzers, Norwegiens, Jutes otherwise called
Jutons, Vites, Gothes or Getes, and Vandals, and all comprehended vnder
the name of Saxons, bicause of Hengist the Saxon and his companie that
first arriued here before anie of the other) and therto hauing now the
monarchie and preheminence in maner of this whole Iland, called the
<span class="leftnote">Of this opinion is <em>Belforest, lib. 3. cap. 44</em>.</span>
same after the name of the countrie from whence he derived his
originall, neither Hengist, neither anie Queene named Angla, neither
whatsoeuer deriuation ab Angulo, as from a corner of the world bearing
swaie, or hauing ought to doo at all in that behalfe.</p>

<small>WHAT SUNDRIE NATIONS HAUE DWELLED IN ALBION.</small><br />

CAP. IV.</h3>

<p>As few or no nations can iustlie boast themselues to haue continued
sithence their countrie was first replenished, without any mixture, more
or lesse, of forreine inhabitants; no more can this our Iland, whose
manifold commodities haue oft allured sundrie princes and famous
capteines of the world to conquer and subdue the same vnto their owne
subiection. Manie sorts of people therfore haue come in hither and
settled themselues here in this Ile, and first of all other, a parcell
<span class="leftnote">Samotheans.</span>]
of the linage and posteritie of Japhet, brought in by Samothes in the
1910. after the creation of Adam. Howbeit in processe of time, and after
they had indifferentlie replenished and furnished this Iland with people
(which was doone in the space of 335. yeares) Albion the giant afore
mentioned, repaired hither with a companie of his owne race procéeding
from Cham, and not onelie annexed the same to his owne dominion, but
brought all such in like sort as he found here of the line of Japhet,
into miserable seruitude and most extreame thraldome. After him also,
<span class="leftnote">Britains.<br />
Chemminits.</span>
and within lesse than sixe hundred and two yeares, came Brute the sonne
of Syluius with a great traine of the posteritie of the dispersed
Troians in 324. ships: who rendering the like courtesie vnto the
Chemminits as they had doone before unto the séed of Japhet, brought
them also wholie vnder his rule and gouernance, and dispossessing the
peeres &amp; inferior owners of their lands and possessions, he diuided the
countrie among such princes and capteines as he in his arriuall here had
led out of Grecia with him.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Romans.</span>
From hencefoorth I doo not find any sound report of other nation
whatsoeuer, that should aduenture hither to dwell, and alter the state
of the land, vntill the Romane emperours subdued it to their dominion,
sauing of a few Galles, (and those peraduenture of Belgie) who first
comming ouer to rob and pilfer vpon the coasts, did afterward plant
themselues for altogither neere vnto the shore, and there builded
sundrie cities and townes which they named after those of the maine,
<span class="page"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[Page 10]</span>
from whence they came vnto vs. And this is not onelie to be gathered out
of Cesar where he writeth of Britaine of set purpose, but also
elsewhere, as in his second booke a little after the beginning: for
speaking of Deuiaticus king of the Swessions liuing in his time, he
affirmeth him not onelie to be the mightiest prince of all the Galles,
but also to hold vnder his subiection the Ile of Britaine, of which his
sonne Galba was afterward dispossessed. But after the comming of the
Romans, it is hard to say with how manie sorts of people we were dailie
pestered, almost in euery steed. For as they planted their forworne
legions in the most fertile places of the realme, and where they might
best lie for the safegard of their conquests: so their armies did
commonlie consist of manie sorts of people, and were (as I may call
them) a confused mixture of all other countries and nations then liuing
in the world. Howbeit, I thinke it best, bicause they did all beare the
title of Romans, to reteine onelie that name for them all, albeit they
were wofull ghests to this our Iland: sith that with them came all maner
of vice and vicious liuing, all riot and excesse of behauiour into our
countrie, which their legions brought hither from each corner of their
dominions; for there was no prouince vnder them from whence they had not
seruitours.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Scots.<br />
Picts.</span>
How and when the Scots, a people mixed of the Scithian and Spanish
blood, should arriue here out of Ireland, &amp; when the Picts should come
vnto vs out of Sarmatia, or from further toward the north &amp; the Scithian
Hyperboreans, as yet it is vncerteine. For though the Scotish histories
doo carrie great countenance of their antiquitie in this Iland: yet (to
saie fréelie what I thinke) I iudge them rather to haue stolne in hither
within the space of 100. yeares before Christ, than to haue continued
here so long as they themselues pretend, if my coniecture be any thing.
Yet I denie not, but that as the Picts were long planted in this Iland
before the Scots aduentured to settle themselues also in Britaine; so
the Scots did often aduenture hither to rob and steale out of Ireland,
and were finallie called in by the Meats or Picts (as the Romans named
them, because they painted their bodies) to helpe them against the
Britains, after the which they so planted themselues in these parts,
that vnto our time that portion of the land cannot be cleansed of them.
I find also that as these Scots were reputed for the most Scithian-like
and barbarous nation, and longest without letters; so they vsed commonlie
to steale ouer into Britaine in leather skewes, and began to helpe the
Picts about or not long before the beginning of Cesars time. For both
Diodorus lib. 6. and Strabo lib. 4. doo seeme to speake of a parcell of
the Irish nation that should inhabit Britaine in their time, which were
giuen to the eating of mans flesh, and therefore called Anthropophagi.
Mamertinus in like sort dooth note the Redshanks and the Irish (which
are properlie the Scots) to be the onelie enimies of our nation, before
the comming of Cæsar, as appeareth in his panegyricall oration, so that
hereby it is found that they are no new ghestes in Britaine. Wherefore
all the controuersie dooth rest in the time of their first attempt to
inhabit in this Iland. Certeinlie I maruell much whie they trauell not
to come in with Cantaber and Partholonus: but I see perfectlie that this
shift should be too grosse for the maintenance of their desired
antiquitie. Now, as concerning their name, the Saxons translated the
word Scotus for Irish: whereby it appeareth that those Irish, of whom
Strabo and Diodorus doo speake, are none other than those Scots, of whom
Ierome speaketh Aduersus Iouinianum, lib. 2. who vsed to feed on the
buttocks of boies and womens paps, as delicate dishes. Aethicus writing
of the Ile of Man, affirmeth it to be inhabited with Scots so well as
Ireland euen in his time. Which is another proofe that the Scots and
Irish are all one people. They were also called Scoti by the Romans,
bicause their Iland &amp; originall inhabitation thereof were vnknowne, and
they themselues an obscure nation in the sight of all the world.
<span class="leftnote">Of the Picts.</span>
Now as concerning the Picts, whatsoeuer Ranulphus Hygden imagineth to
the contrarie of their latter enterance, it is easie to find by Herodian
and Mamertinus (of which the one calleth them Meates, the other
Redshankes and Pictones) that they were setled in this Ile long before
the time of Seuerus, yea of Cæsar, and comming of the Scots. Which is
proofe sufficient, if no further authoritie remained extant for the
same. So that the controuersie lieth not in their comming also, but in
<span class="page"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[Page 11]</span>
the true time of their repaire and aduenture into this Iland out of the
Orchades (out of which they gat ouer into the North parts of our
countrie, as the writers doo report) and from whence they came at the
first into the aforsaid Ilands. For my part I suppose with other, that
they came hither out of Sarmatia or Scythia: for that nation hauing had
alwaies an eie vnto the commodities of our countrie, hath sent out manie
companies to inuade and spoile the same. It may be that some will
gather, those to be the Picts, of whom Cæsar saith that they stained
their faces with wad and madder, to the end they might appeare terrible
and feareful to their enimies; and so inferre that the Picts were
naturall Britans. But it is one thing to staine the face onelie as the
Britans did, of whom Propertius saith,</p>

<p class="ind1">Nunc etiam infectos demum mutare Britannos,</p>

<p>And to paint the images and portraitures of beasts, fish and foules ouer
the whole bodie, as the Picts did, of whom Martial saith,</p>

<p class="ind1">Barbara depictis veni Bascauda Britannis.</p>

<p>Certes the times of Samothes and Albion, haue some likelie limitation;
and so we may gather of the comming in of Brute, of Cæsar, the Saxons,
the Danes, the Normans, and finallie of the Flemmings, (who had the
Rosse in Wales assigned vnto them 1066. after the drowning of their
countrie.) But when first the Picts, &amp; then the Scots should come ouer
into our Iland, as they were obscure people, so the time of their
arriuall is as far to me vnknowne. Wherefore the resolution of this
point must still remaine In tenebris. This neuerthelesse is certeine,
that Maximus first Legate of Britaine, and afterward emperour, draue the
Scots out of Britaine, and compelled them to get habitation in Ireland,
the out Iles, and the North part of the maine, and finallie diuided
their region betwéene the Britaines and the Picts. He denounced warre
also against the Irishmen, for receiuing them into their land: but they
crauing the peace, yéelded to subscribe, that from thence-foorth they
would not receiue any Scot into their dominions; and so much the more,
for that they were pronounced enimies to the Romans, and disturbers of
the common peace and quietnesse of their prouinces here in England.</p>

<p>The Saxons became first acquainted with this Ile, by meanes of the
piracie which they dailie practised vpon our coastes (after they had
once begun to aduenture themselues also vpon the seas, thereby to seeke
out more wealth than was now to be gotten in the West parts of the
maine, which they and their neighbours had alreadie spoiled in most
lamentable and barbarous maner) howbeit they neuer durst presume to
<span class="leftnote">The hurt by forren aid.</span>
inhabit in this Iland, vntill they were sent for by Vortiger to serue
him in his warres against the Picts and Scots, after that the Romans had
giuen vs ouer, and left vs wholie to our owne defense and regiment.
Being therefore come vnder Hengist in three bottoms or kéeles, and in
short time espieng the idle and negligent behauiour of the Britaines,
and fertilitie of our soile, they were not a little inflamed to make a
full conquest of such as at the first they came to aid and succour.
Herevpon also they fell by little and little to the winding in of
greater numbers of their countrimen and neighbours, with their wiues and
children into this region, so that within a while these new comlings
began to molest the homelings, and ceased not from time to time to
continue their purpose, vntill they had gotten possession of the whole,
or at the leastwise the greatest part of our countrie; the Britons in
the meane season being driuen either into Wales and Cornewall, or
altogither out of the Iland to séeke new habitations.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Danes.</span>
In like maner the Danes (the next nation that succéeded) came at the
first onelie to pilfer and robbe vpon the frontiers of our Iland, till
that in the end, being let in by the Welshmen or Britons through an
earnest desire to be reuenged vpon the Saxons, they no lesse plagued the
one than the other, their fréends than their aduersaries, seeking by all
meanes possible to establish themselues also in the sure possession of
Britaine. But such was their successe, that they prospered not long in
their deuise: for so great was their lordlinesse, crueltie, and
<span class="page"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[Page 12]</span>
insatiable desire of riches, beside their detestable abusing of chast
matrons, and yoong virgins (whose husbands and parents were dailie
inforced to become their drudges and slaues, whilest they sat at home
and fed like drone bées of the sweet of their trauell and labours) that
God I say would not suffer them to continue any while ouer vs, but when
he saw his time he remooued their yoke, and gaue vs liberty as it were
to breath vs, thereby to see whether this his sharpe scourge could haue
mooued vs to repentance and amendment of our lewd and sinfull liues, or
not. But when no signe thereof appeared in our hearts, he called in an
<span class="leftnote">The Normans.</span>
other nation to vex vs, I meane the Normans, a people mixed with Danes,
and of whom it is worthilie doubted, whether they were more hard and
cruell to our countrimen than the Danes, or more heauie and intollerable
to our Iland than the Saxons or the Romans. This nation came out of
Newstria, the people thereof were called Normans by the French, bicause
the Danes which subdued that region, came out of the North parts of the
world: neuerthelesse, I suppose that the ancient word Newstria, is
corrupted from West-rijc, bicause that if you marke the situation, it
lieth opposite from Austria or Ost-rijc, which is called the East
region, as Newstria is the Weast: for Rijc in the old Scithian toong
dooth signifie a region or kingdome, as in Franc-rijc, or Franc-reich,
Westsaxon-reich, Ost saxon-reich, Su-rijc, Angel-rijc, &amp;c, is else to be
séene. But howsoeuer this falleth out, these Normans or Danish French,
were dedlie aduersaries to the English Saxons, first by meane of a
quarell that grew betwéene them in the daies of Edward the Confessour,
at such time as the Earle of Bullen, and William Duke of Normandie,
arriued in this land to visit him, &amp; their freends; such Normans (I
meane) as came ouer with him and Emma his mother before him, in the time
of Canutus and Ethelred. For the first footing that euer the French did
set in this Iland, sithence the time of Ethelbert &amp; Sigebert, was with
Emma, which Ladie brought ouer a traine of French Gentlemen and Ladies
with hir into England.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The cause of the conquest by the Normans.</span>
After hir also no small numbers of attendants came in with Edward the
Confessour, whome he preferred to the greatest offices in the realme, in
so much that one Robert a Norman, became Archbishop of Canturburie,
whose preferment so much enhanced the minds of the French, on the one
side, as their lordlie and outragious demeanour kindled the stomachs of
the English nobilitie against them on the other: insomuch that not long
before the death of Emma the kings mother, and vpon occasion of the
brall hapning at Douer (whereof I haue made sufficient mention in my
Chronologie, not regarding the report of the French authors in this
behalfe, who write altogither in the fauour of their Archbishop Robert,
but following the authoritie of an English préest then liuing in the
court) the English Peeres began to shew their disliking in manifest
maner. Neuerthelesse, the Normans so bewitched the king with their lieng
and bosting, Robert the Archbishop being the chéefe instrument of their
practise, that he beléeued them, and therevpon vexed sundrie of the
nobilitie, amongst whom Earle Goodwijn of Kent was the chéefe, a noble
Gentleman and father in law to king Edward by the mariage of his
daughter. The matter also came to such issue against him, that he was
exiled, and fiue of his sonnes with him, wherevpon he goeth ouer the
sea, and soone after returning with his said sonnes, they inuaded the
land in sundrie places, the father himselfe comming to London, where
when the kings power was readie to ioine with him in battell, it
vtterlie refused so to doo: affirming plainelie, that it should be méere
follie for one Englishman to fight against another, in the reuenge of
Frenchmens quarels: which answer entred so déeplie into the kings mind,
that he was contented to haue the matter heard, and appointing
commissioners for that purpose; they concluded at the vpshot, that all
the French should depart out of England by a day, few excepted, whom the
<span class="leftnote">Archbishop of Can. exiled, and the rest of the French.</span>
king should appoint and nominate. By this means therfore Robert the
Archbishop, &amp; of secret counsell with the king, was first exiled as
principall abuser &amp; seducer of the king, who goeth to Rome, &amp; there
complaineth to the Pope of his iniurie receiued by the English. Howbeit
as he returned home againe with no small hope of the readeption of his
See, he died in Normandie, whereby he saued a killing. Certes he was the
first that euer tendered complaint out of England vnto Rome, &amp; with him
went William Bishop of London (afterward reuoked) and Vlfo of Lincolne,
who hardlie escaped the furie of the English nobilitie. Some also went
<span class="page"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[Page 13]</span>
into Scotland, and there held themselues, expecting a better time. And
this is the true historie of the originall cause of the conquest of
England by the French: for after they were well beaten at Douer, bicause
of their insolent demeanour there shewed, their harts neuer ceased to
boile with a desire of reuenge that brake out into a flame, so soone as
their Robert possessed the primacie, which being once obteined, and to
set his mischéefe intended abroch withall, a contention was quicklie
procured about certeine Kentish lands, and controuersie kindled, whether
he or the Earle should haue most right vnto them. The king held with the
<span class="leftnote">Erle Goodwine slandered by the French writers.</span>
priest as with the church, the nobilitie with the Earle. In processe
also of this businesse, the Archbishop accused the Earle of high
treason, burdening him with the slaughter of Alfred the kings brother,
which was altogither false: as appeareth by a treatise yet extant of
that matter, written by a chaplaine to king Edward the Confessour, in
the hands of Iohn Stow my verie fréend, wherein he saith thus, "Alfredus
incautè agens in aduentu suo in Angliam a Danis circumuentus occiditur."
He addeth moreouer, that giuing out as he came through the countrie
accompanied with his few proud Normans, how his meaning was to recouer
his right vnto the kingdome, and supposing that all men would haue
yéelded vnto him, he fell into their hands, whome Harald then king did
send to apprehend him, vpon the fame onelie of this report brought vnto
his eares. So that (to be short) after the king had made his
pacification with the Earle, the French (I say) were exiled, the Quéene
restored to his fauour (whom he at the beginning of this broile had
imprisoned at Wilton, allowing hir but one onlie maid to wait upon hir)
and the land reduced to hir former quietnesse, which continued vntill
the death of the king. After which the Normans not forgetting their old
grudge, remembred still their quarell, that in the end turned to their
conquest of this Iland. After which obteined, they were so cruellie bent
<span class="leftnote">The miserie of the English vnder the French.</span>
to our vtter subuersion and ouerthrow, that in the beginning it was lesse
reproch to be accounted a slaue than an Englishman, or a drudge in anie
filthie businesse than a Britaine: insomuch that euerie French page was
superiour to the greatest Peere; and the losse of an Englishmans life
but a pastime to such of them as contended in their brauerie, who should
giue the greatest strokes or wounds vnto their bodies, when their
toiling and drudgerie could not please them, or satisfie their gréedie
humors. Yet such was our lot in those daies by the diuine appointed
order, that we must needs obey such as the Lord did set ouer vs, and so
much the rather, for that all power to resist was vtterlie taken from
vs, and our armes made so weake and feeble that they were not now able
to remooue the importable load of the enimie from our surburdened
<span class="leftnote">The cause of our miserie.</span>
shoulders. And this onelie I saie againe, bicause we refused grace
offered in time, and would not heare when God by his Preachers did call
vs so fauourablie vnto him. Oh how miserable was the estate of our
countrie vnder the French and Normans, wherein the Brittish and English
that remained, could not be called to any function in the commonwealth,
no not so much as to be constables and headburowes in small villages,
except they could bring 2. or 3. Normans for suerties to the Lords of
the soile for their good behauiour in their offices! Oh what numbers of
all degrées of English and Brittish were made slaues and bondmen, and
bought and sold as oxen in open market! In so much that at the first
comming, the French bond were set free; and those that afterward became
bond, were of our owne countrie and nation, so that few or rather none
of vs remained free without some note of bondage and seruitude to the
French. Hereby then we perceiue, how from time to time this Iland hath
not onelie béene a prey, but as it were a common receptacle for
strangers, the naturall homelings or Britons being still cut shorter and
shorter, as I said before, till in the end they came not onelie to be
<span class="rightnote">In this voiage the said Harald builded Portaschith,
which Caradoch ap Griffin afterward ouerthrew, and killed the
garrison that Harald left therein.</span>
driuen into a corner of this region, but in time also verie like
vtterlie to haue beene extinguished. For had not king Edward, surnamed
the saint, in his time, after greeuous wars made vpon them 1063.
(wherein Harald latelie made Earle of Oxenford, sonne to Goodwin Earle
of Kent, and after king of England, was his generall) permitted the
remnant of their women to ioine in mariage with the Englishmen (when the
most part of their husbands and male children were slaine with the
sword) it could not haue béene otherwise chosen, but their whole race
must néeds haue susteined the
<span class="page"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[Page 14]</span>
vttermost confusion, and thereby the memorie of the Britons vtterlie
haue perished among vs.</p>

<p>Thus we see how England hath six times beene subiect to the reproch of
conquest. And wheras the Scots séeme to challenge manie famous victories
also ouer us, beside gréeuous impositions, tributs, &amp; dishonorable
compositions: it shall suffice for answer, that they deale in this as in
the most part of their historie, which is to seeke great honor by lieng,
&amp; great renowme by prating and craking. Indeed they haue doone great
mischéefe in this Iland, &amp; with extreme crueltie; but as for any
conquest the first is yet to heare of. Diuers other conquests also haue
béene pretended by sundrie princes sithence the conquest, onelie to the
end that all pristinate lawes and tenures of possession might cease, and
they make a new disposition of all things at their owne pleasure. As one
by king Edw. the 3. but it tooke none effect. Another by Henrie the 4.
who neuerthelesse was at the last though hardlie drawne from the
challenge by William Thorington, then cheefe Justice of England. The
third by Henrie the 7. who had some better shew of right, but yet
without effect. And the last of all by Q. Marie, as some of the papists
gaue out, and also would haue had hir to haue obteined, but God also
staied their malices, and hir challenge. But beside the six afore
mentioned, Huntingdon the old historiographer speaketh of a seuenth,
likelie (as he saith) to come one daie out of the North, which is a wind
that bloweth no man to good, sith nothing is to be had in those parts,
but hunger &amp; much cold. Sée more hereof in the historie of S. Albons,
and aforsaid author which lieth on the left side of the librarie
belonging now to Paules: for I regard no prophesies as one that doubteth
from what spirit they doo procéed, or who should be the author of them.</p>

CAP. V.</h3>

<p>Besides these aforesaid nations, which haue crept (as you haue heard)
into our Iland, we read of sundrie giants that should inhabit here.
Which report as it is not altogither incredible, sith the posterities of
diuers princes were called by the name: so vnto some mens eares it
seemeth so strange a rehersall, that for the same onelie cause they
suspect the credit of our whole historie, &amp; reiect it as a fable,
vnworthie to be read. They also condemne the like in all other
histories, especiallie of the North, where men are naturallie of
greatest stature, imagining all to be but fables that is written of
Starcater, Hartben, Angrine, Aruerode, &amp;c: of whom Saxo, Johannes Magnus
and Olaus doo make mention, &amp; whose bones doo yet remaine to be seene as
rare miracles in nature. Of these also some in their life time were able
to lift vp (as they write) a vessell of liquor of 1000. weight, or an
horsse, or an oxe, &amp; cast it on their shoulders (wherein their verie
women haue beene likewise knowne to come néere vnto them) and of the
race of those men, some were séene of no lesse strength in the 1500. of
Grace, wherein Olaus liued, and wrote the same of his owne experience
and knowledge. Of the giant of Spaine that died of late yeares by a fall
vpon the Alpes, as he either went or came fro Rome, about the purchase
of a dispensation to marrie with his kinswoman (a woman also of much
more than common stature) there be men yet liuing, and may liue long for
age, that can saie verie much euen by their owne knowledge. Wherfore it
appeareth by present experience, that all is not absolutelie vntrue
which is remembred of men of such giants. For this cause therfore I haue
now taken vpon me to make this breefe discourse insuing, as indeuouring
therby to prooue, that the opinion of giants is not altogither grounded
vpon vaine and fabulous narrations, inuented onelie to delight the eares
of the hearers with the report of maruellous things: but that there haue
beene such men in deed, as for their hugenesse of person haue resembled
rather* high towers than mortall men, although their posterities are
<span class="rightnote">* <em>Esay. 30. vers. 25.</em></span>
<span class="page"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[Page 15]</span>
now consumed, and their monstruous races vtterlie worne out of
knowledge.</p>

<p>I doo not meane herein to dispute, whether this name Gigas or Nephilim
was giuen vnto them, rather for their tyrannie and oppression of the
people, than for their greatnesse of bodie, or large steps, as Goropius
would haue it (for he denieth that euer men were greater than at this
present) or bicause their parents were not knowne, for such in old time
were called Terræ filij; or whether the word Gigas dooth onlie signifie
Indigenas, or homelings, borne in the land or not; neither whether all
men were of like quantitie in stature, and farre more greater in old
time, than now they be: and yet absolutelie I denie neither of these,
sith verie probable reasons may be brought for ech of them, but
especiallie the last rehearsed, whose confirmation dependeth vpon the
authorities of sundrie ancient writers, who make diuers of noble race,
equall to the giants in strength and manhood, and yet doo not giue the
same name vnto them, bicause their quarels were iust, and commonlie
taken in hand for defense of the oppressed. Examples hereof we may
<span class="leftnote">Antheus. <em>Lucane lib. 4 in fine.</em></span>
take of Hercules and Antheus, whose wrestling declareth that they were
equall in stature &amp; stomach. Such also was the courage of Antheus, that
being often ouercome, and as it were vtterlie vanquished by the said
Hercules, yet if he did eftsoones returne againe into his kingdome, he
forthwith recouered his force, returned and held Hercules tacke, till he
gat at the last betwéene him and home, so cutting off the farther hope
of the restitution of his armie, and killing finallie his aduersarie in
the field, of which victorie Politian writeth thus:</p>

<p class="ind1">Incaluere animis dura certare palæstra,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neptuni quondàm filius atque Iouis:<br />
Non certamen erant operoso ex ære lebetes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sed qui vel vitam vel ferat interitum:<br />
Occidit Antæus Ioue natum viuere fas est,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estq; magistra Pales Græcia, non Lybia.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Corineus.<br />
Gomagot.</span>
The like doo our histories report of Corineus and Gomagot, peraduenture
king of this Ile, who fought a combat hand to hand, till one of them was
slaine, and yet for all this no man reputeth Hercules or Corineus for
giants, albeit that Hanuile in his Architrenion make the later to be 12.
cubits in height, which is full 18. foot, if poeticall licence doo not
take place in his report and assertion. But sith (I say againe) it is
not my purpose to stand vpon these points, I passe ouer to speake any
more of them. And whereas also I might haue proceeded in such order,
that I should first set downe by manie circumstances, whether any giants
were, then whether they were of such huge and incredible stature as the
authours doo remember, and finallie whether any of them haue beene in
this our Iland or not, I protest plainlie, that my mind is not here bent
to deale in any such maner, but rather generallie to confirme and by
sufficient authoritie, that there haue beene such mightie men of
stature, and some of them also in Britaine, which I will set downe
onelie by sundrie examples, whereby it shall fall out, that neither our
Iland, nor any part of the maine, haue at one time or other béen
altogither without them. First of all therfore, &amp; to begin with the
scriptures, the most sure &amp; certeine ground of all knowledge: you shall
haue out of them such notable examples set downe, as I haue obserued in
reading the same, which vnto the godlie may suffice for sufficient
proofe of my position. Neuerthelesse, after the scriptures I will resort
to the writings of our learned Diuines, and finallie of the infidell and
pagane authors, whereby nothing shall seeme to want that may confute
Goropius, and all his cauillations.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Cap. 6. vers. 5.</em></span>
Moses the prophet of the Lord, writing of the estate of things before
the floud, hath these words in his booke of generations. In these daies
saith he, there were giants vpon the earth. Berosus also the Chalde
<span class="leftnote"><em>Anti. li. 1.</em></span>
writeth, that néere vnto Libanus there was a citie called Oenon (which I
take to be Hanoch, builded sometime by Cham) wherein giants did inhabit,
who trusting to the strength and hugenesse of their bodies, did verie
great oppression and mischeefe in the world. The Hebrues called them
generallie Enach, of Hanach the Chebronite, father to Achimam, Scheschai
<span class="page"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[Page 16]</span>
and Talma, although their first originall was deriued from Henoch the
sonne of Caine, of whome that pestilent race descended, as I read. The
Moabits named them Emims, and the Ammonites Zamsummims, and it should
seeme by the second of Deut. cap. 19, 20. that Ammon and Moab were
greatlie replenished with such men, when Moses wrote that treatise. For
of these monsters some families remained of greater stature than other
<span class="leftnote"><em>Nu. cap. 13. verse 33, &amp; 34.</em></span>
vnto his daies, in comparison of whome the children of Israell confessed
themselues to be but grashoppers. Which is one noble testimonie that the
word Gigas or Enach is so well taken for a man of huge stature, as for
an homeborne child, wicked tyrant, or oppressour of the people.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Deut. 3. vers. 11.</em><br /> Og of Basan.</span>
Furthermore, there is mention made also in the scriptures of Og,
sometime king of Basan, who was the last of the race of the giants, that
was left in the land of promise to be ouercome by the Israelits, &amp; whose
iron bed was afterward shewed for a woonder at Rabbath (a citie of the
Ammonites) conteining 9. cubits in length, and 4. in bredth, which
cubits I take not to be geometricall, (that is, each one so great as six
of the smaller, as those were wherof the Arke was made, as our Diuines
affirme, especiallie Augustine: whereas Origen, hom. 2. in Gen. out of
whom he seemeth to borrow it, appeareth to haue no such meaning
directlie) but rather of the arme of a meane man, which oftentimes dooth
varie &amp; differ from the standard. Oh how Goropius dalieth about the
historie of this Og, of the breaking of his pate against the beds head,
&amp; of hurting his ribs against the sides, and all to prooue, that Og was
not bigger than other men, and so he leaueth the matter as sufficientlie
answered with a French countenance of truth. But see August. de ciuit.
lib. 15. cap. 25. &amp; ad Faustum Manich. lib. 12. Ambros. &amp;c. and Johannes
Buteo that excellent geometrician, who hath written of purpose of the
capacitie of the Arke.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Cap. 17. ver. 4,<br /> 5, 6.</em> Goliah.</span>
In the first of Samuel you shall read of Goliah a Philistine, the weight
of whose brigandine or shirt of maile was of 5000. sicles, or 1250.
ounces of brasse, which amounteth to 104. pound of Troie weight after 4.
common sicles to the ounce. The head of his speare came vnto ten pound
English or 600. sicles of that metall. His height also was measured at
six cubits and an hand bredth. All which doo import that he was a
notable giant, and a man of great stature &amp; strength to weare such an
armour, and beweld so heauie a lance. But Goropius thinking himselfe
still to haue Og in hand, and indeuouring to extenuate the fulnesse of
the letter to his vttermost power, dooth neuerthelesse earnestlie
affirme, that he was not aboue three foot more than the common sort of
men, or two foot higher than Saule: and so he leaueth it as determined.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Cap. 21. ver. 16, 17, &amp;c.</em></span>
In the second of Samuel, I find report of foure giants borne in Geth; of
which Ishbenob the first, that would haue killed Dauid, had a speare,
whose head weighed the iust halfe of that of Goliath: the second called
Siphai, Sippai or Saph, 1. Par. 20. was nothing inferiour to the first:
the third hight also Goliah, the staffe of whose speare was like vnto
the beame of a weauers loome, neuerthelesse he was slaine in the second
battell in Gob by Elhanan, as the first was by Abisai Ioabs brother, and
the second by Elhanan. The fourth brother (for they were all brethren)
was slaine at Gath by Ionathan nephew to Dauid, and he was not onlie
huge of personage, but also of disfigured forme, for he had 24. fingers
and toes. Wherby it is euident, that the generation of giants was not
extinguished in Palestine, vntill the time of Dauid, which was 2890.
after the floud, nor vtterlie consumed in Og, as some of our expositors
would haue it.</p>

<p>Now to come vnto our christian writers. For though the authorities
alreadie alleged out of the word, are sufficient to confirme my purpose
at the full; yet will I not let to set downe such other notes as
experience hath reuealed, onelie to the end that the reader shall not
thinke the name of giants, with their quantities, and other
circumstances, mentioned in the scriptures, rather to haue some
mysticall interpretation depending vpon them, than that the sense of the
text in this behalfe is to be taken simplie as it speaketh. And first of
all to omit that which Tertullian Lib. 2. de resurrect. saith;
<span class="leftnote"><em>De ciuitate Dei lib. 15. cap. 9.</em></span>
S. Augustine noteth, how he with other saw the tooth of a man, wherof he
tooke good aduisement, and pronounced in the end that it would haue made
<span class="page"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[Page 17]</span>
100. of his owne, or anie other mans that liued in his time. The like
<span class="leftnote"><em>Iohannes Boccacius.</em></span>
hereof also dooth Iohn Boccace set downe, in the 68. chapter of his 4.
booke, saieng that in the caue of a mountaine, not far from Drepanum (a
towne of Sicilia called Eryx as he gesseth) the bodie of an exceeding
high giant was discouered, thrée of whose teeth did weigh 100. ounces,
which being conuerted into English poise, doth yeeld eight pound and
foure ounces, after twelue ounces to the pound, that is 33. ounces
euerie tooth.</p>

<p>He addeth farther, that the forepart of his scull was able to conteine
manie bushels of wheat, and by the proportion of the bone of his thigh,
<span class="leftnote">A carcase discouered of 200. cubits.</span>
the Symmetricians iudged his bodie to be aboue 200. cubits. Those teeth,
scull, and bones, were (and as I thinke yet are, for ought I know to the
contrarie) to be seene in the church of Drepanum in perpetuall memorie
of his greatnesse, whose bodie was found vpon this occasion. As some
digged in the earth to laie the foundation of an house, the miners
happened vpon a great vault, not farre from Drepanum: whereinto when
they were entred, they saw the huge bodie of a man sitting in the caue,
of whose greatnesse they were so afraid, that they ranne awaie, and made
an outcrie in the citie, how there sat a man in such a place, so great
as an hill: the people hearing the newes, ran out with clubs and
weapons, as if they should haue gone vnto a foughten field, and 300. of
them entring into the caue, they foorthwith saw that he was dead, and
yet sat as if he had been aliue, hauing a staffe in his hand, compared
by mine author vnto the mast of a tall ship, which being touched fell by
and by to dust, sauing the nether end betwéene his hand and the ground,
whose hollownesse was filled with 1500. pound weight of lead, to beare
vp his arme that it should not fall in péeces: neuerthelesse, his bodie
also being touched fell likewise into dust, sauing three of his
aforesaid teeth, the forepart of his scull, and one of his thigh bones,
which are reserued to be séene of such as will hardlie beleeue these
reports.</p>

<p>In the histories of Brabant I read of a giant found, whose bones were
17. or 18. cubits in length, but Goropius, as his maner is, denieth them
to be the bones of a man, affirming rather that they were the bones of
an elephant, because they somwhat resembled those of two such beasts
which were found at the making of the famous ditch betwéene Bruxels and
Machlin. As though there were anie precise resemblance betwéene the
bones of a man and of an elephant, or that there had euer béene any
elephant of 27. foot in length. But sée his demeanour. In the end he
granteth that another bodie was found vpon the shore of Rhodanus, of
thirtie foot in length. Which somewhat staieth his iudgement, but not
altogither remooueth his error.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Mat. Westmon.</em></span>
The bodie of Pallas was found in Italie, in the yeare of Grace 1038. and
being measured it conteined twentie foot in length, this Pallas was
companion with Æneas.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Iohannes Leland.</em></span>
There was a carcase also laid bare 1170. in England vpon the shore
(where the beating of the sea had washed awaie the earth from the stone
wherein it laie) and when it was taken vp it conteined 50. foot in
<span class="leftnote"><em>Mafieus, lib. 14. Triuet.</em></span>
measure, as our histories doo report. The like was seene before in
<span class="leftnote"><br /><em>Mat. West.</em></span>
Wales, in the yeare 1087. of another of 14. foot.</p>

<p>In Perth moreouer a village in Scotland another was taken vp, which to
this daie they shew in a church, vnder the name of little John (per
Antiphrasin) being also 14. foot in length, as diuerse doo affirme which
<span class="leftnote"><em>Hector Boet.</em></span>
haue beholden the same, and whereof Hector Boetius dooth saie, that he
did put his whole arme into one of the hanch bones: which is worthie to
be remembred.</p>

<p>In the yeare of Grace 1475. the bodie of Tulliola the daughter of Cicero
was taken vp, &amp; found higher by not a few foot than the common sort of
women liuing in those daies.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Geruasius Tilberiensis.</em></span>
Geruasius Tilberiensis, head Marshall to the king of Arles writeth in
his Chronicle dedicated to Otho 4. how that at Isoretum, in the suburbes
of Paris, he saw the bodie of a man that was twentie foot long, beside
the head and the necke, which was missing &amp; not found, the owner hauing
peraduenture béene beheaded for some notable trespasse committed in
times past, or (as he saith) killed by S. William.</p>

<p>The Greeke writers make mention of Andronicus their emperour, who liued
1183. of Grace, and was ten foot in height, that is, thrée foot higher
than the Dutch man that shewed himselfe in manie places of England,
<span class="page"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[Page 18]</span>
1582. this man maried Anna daughter to Lewis of France (before assured
to Alexius, whome he strangled, dismembred and drowned in the sea) the
ladie not being aboue eleuen yeares of age, whereas he was an old
dotard, and beside hir he kept Marpaca a fine harlot, who ruled him as
she listed.</p>

<p>Zonaras speaketh of a woman that liued in the daies of Justine, who
being borne in Cilicia, and of verie comelie personage, was
neuerthelesse almost two foot taller than the tallest woman of hir time.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Sir Thomas Eliot.</em></span>

In Gillesland in Come Whitton paroche not far from the chappell of the

therein the bones of a man, of more than incredible greatnes. In like
sort Leland speaketh of another found in the Ile called Alderney,
whereof you shall read more in the chapiter of our Ilands.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Richard Grafton.</em></span>
Richard Grafton in his Manuell telleth of one whose shinbone conteined
six foot, and thereto his scull so great that it was able to receiue
fiue pecks of wheat. Wherefore by coniecturall symmetrie of these parts,
his bodie must needs be of 24. foot, or rather more, if it were

diligentlie measured. For the proportion of a comelie and well featured
bodie, answereth 9. times to the length of the face, taken at large from
the pitch of the crowne to the chin, as the whole length is from the
same place vnto the sole of the foot, measured by an imagined line, and
seuered into so manie parts by like ouerthwart draughts, as Drurerus in
his lineall description of mans bodie doth deliuer. Neuertheles, this
symmetrie is not taken by other than the well proportioned face, for
Recta, orbiculata (or fornicata) prona, resupinata, and lacunata (or
repanda) doo so far degenerate from the true proportion as from the
forme and beautie of the comelie. Hereby also they make the face taken
in strict maner, to be the tenth part of the whole bodie, that is,
fr&#333; the highest part of the forehead to the pitch of the chin, so
that in the vse of the word face there is a difference, wherby the 9.
part is taken (I say) from the crowne (called Vertex, because the haire
there turneth into a circle) so that if the space by a rule were truelie
taken, I meane from the crowne or highest part of the head to the pitch
of the nether chap, and multiplied by nine, the length of the whole
bodie would easilie appeare, &amp; shew it selfe at the full. In like maner
I find, that from the elbow to the top of the midle finger is the 4.
part of the whole length, called a cubit: from the wrist to the top of
the same finger, a tenth part: the length of the shinbone to the ancle a
fourth part (and all one with the cubit:) from the top of the finger to
the third ioint, two third parts of the face from the top of the
forehead. Which obseruations I willinglie remember in this place, to the
end that if anie such carcases happen to be found hereafter, it shall
not be hard by some of these bones here mentioned, to come by the
stature of the whole bodie, in certeine &amp; exact maner. As for the rest
of the bones, ioints, parts, &amp;c: you may resort to Drurerus, Cardan, and
other writers, sith the farther deliuerie of them concerneth not my
purpose. To proceed therefore with other examples, I read that the bodie
<span class="leftnote"><em>Sylvester Gyraldus.</em></span>
of king Arthur being found in the yeare 1189. was two foot higher than
anie man that came to behold the same. Finallie the carcase of William
Conqueror was séene not manie yeares since (to wit, 1542.) in the citie
<span class="leftnote"><em>Constans fama Gallorum.</em></span>
of Cane, twelue inches longer, by the iudgment of such as saw it, than
anie man which dwelled in the countrie. All which testimonies I note
togither, bicause they proceed from christian writers, from whome
nothing should be farther or more distant, than of set purpose to lie,
and feed the world with fables.</p>

<p>In our times also, and whilest Francis the first reigned ouer France,
there was a man séene in Aquiteine, whome the king being in those
parties made of his gard, whose height was such, that a man of common
heigth might easilie go vnder his twist without stooping, a stature
<span class="leftnote">Briat.</span>
incredible. Moreouer Casanion, a writer of our time, telleth of the
bones of Briat a giant found of late in Delphinois, of 15. cubits, the
diameter of whose scull was two cubits, and the breadth of his shoulders
foure, as he himselfe beheld in the late second wars of France, &amp;
wherevnto the report of Ioan Marius made in his bookes De Galliarum
<span class="page"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[Page 19]</span>
illustrationibus,where he writeth of the carcase of the same giant found
not farre from the Rhodanus, which was 22. foot long, from the scull to
the sole of the feet, dooth yéeld sufficient testimonie. Also Calameus
in his commentaries De Biturigibus, confirmeth no lesse, adding that he
was found 1556. &amp; so dooth Baptista Fulgosus, lib. 1. cap. 6. saieng
farther, that his graue was seene not farre from Valentia, and
discouered by the violence and current of the Rhodanus. The said
Casanion in like sort speaketh of the bones of a man which he beheld,
one of whose téeth was a foot long, and eight pound in weight. Also of
the sepulchre of another neere vnto Charmes castell, which was nine
paces in length, things incredible to vs, if eiesight did not confirme
it in our owne times, and these carcases were not reserued by the verie
prouidence of God, to the end we might behold his works, and by these
relikes vnderstand, that such men were in old time in deed, of whose
statures we now begin to doubt. Now to say somwhat also of mine owne
knowledge, there is the thighbone of a man to be séene in the church of
S. Laurence néere Guildhall in London, which in time past was 26. inches
in length, but now it beginneth to decaie, so that it is shorter by
foure inches than it was in the time of king Edward. Another also is to
be seene in Aldermarie burie, of some called Aldermanburie, of 32.
inches and rather more, whereof the symmetrie hath beene taken by some
skilfull in that practise, and an image made according to that
proportion, which is fixt in the east end of the cloister of the same
church, not farre from the said bone, and sheweth the person of a man
full ten or eleuen foot high, which as some say was found in the
cloister of Poules, that was neere to the librarie, at such time as the
Duke of Somerset did pull it downe to the verie foundation, and carried
the stones thereof to the Strand, where he did build his house. These
two bones haue I séene, beside other, whereof at the beholding I tooke
no great heed, bicause I minded not as then to haue had any such vse of
their proportions, and therefore I will speake no more of them: this is
sufficient for my purpose that is deliuered out of the christian
authors.</p>

<p>Now it resteth furthermore that I set downe, what I haue read therof in
Pagane writers, who had alwaies great regard of their credit, and so
ought all men that dedicate any thing vnto posteritie, least in going
about otherwise to reape renowme and praise, they doo procure vnto
themselues in the end nothing else but meere contempt and infamie. For
my part I will touch rare things, and such as to my selfe doo séeme
almost incredible: howbeit as I find them, so I note them, requiring
your Honour in reading hereof, to let euerie Author beare his owne
burden, and euerie oxe his bundle.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>In vita Sertorij de Antheo.</em></span>
Plutarch telleth how Sertorius being in Lybia, néere to the streicts of
Maroco, to wit, at Tingi (or Tanger in Mauritania, as it is now called)
caused the sepulchre of Antheus, afore remembred to be opened: for
hearing by common report that the said giant laie buried there, whose
corps was fiftie cubits long at the least, he was so far off from
crediting the same, that he would not beleeue it, vntill he saw the
coffin open wherein the bones of the aforesaid prince did rest. To be
short therefore, he caused his souldiers to cast downe the hill made
sometime ouer the tombe, and finding the bodie in the bottome coffined
in stone, after the measure therof taken, he saw it manifestlie to be
60. cubits in length, which were ten more than the people made accompt
of, which Strabo also confirmeth.</p>

<p>Pausanias reporteth out of one Miso, that when the bodie of Aiax was
found, the whirlebone of his knée was adiudged so broad as a pretie
dish: also that the bodie of Asterius somtime king of Creta was ten
cubits long, and that of Hyllus or Gerion no lesse maruelous than the
rest, all which Goropius still condemneth to be the bones of monsters of
the sea (notwithstanding the manifest formes of their bones, epitaphes,
and inscriptions found ingrauen in brasse and lead with them in their
sepulchres) so far is he from being persuaded and led from his opinion.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Philostrate.</em></span>
Philostrate in Heroicis saith, how he saw the bodie of a giant thirtie
cubits in length, also the carcase of another of two and twentie, and
the third of twelue.</p>

<p>Liuie in the seauenth of his first decade, speaketh of an huge person
which made a challenge as he stood at the end of the Anien bridge,
against any Romane that would come out and fight with him, whose
<span class="page"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[Page 20]</span>
stature was not much inferiour to that of Golias, of Artaches (of whome
Herodot speaketh in the historie of Xerxes) who was sixe common cubits
of stature, which make but fiue of the kings standard, bicause this is
longer by thrée fingers than the other. Of Pusio, Secundilla, &amp; Cabaras,
of which the first two liuing vnder Augustus were aboue ten foot, and
the later vnder Claudius of full nine, and all remembred by Plinie; of
Eleazar a Jew, of whome Iosephus saith, that he was sent to Tiberius,
and a person of heigth fiue cubits; of another of whom Nicephorus maketh
mention lib. 12. cap. 13. Hist. eccles. of fiue cubits and an handfull,
I say nothing, bicause Casanion of Mutterell hath alredie sufficientlie
discoursed vpon these examples in his De gigantibus, which as I gesse he
hath written of set purpose against Goropius, who in his Gigantomachia,
supposeth himselfe to haue killed all the giants in the world, and like
a new Iupiter Alterum carcasse Herculem, as the said Casanion dooth
merilie charge and vpbraid him.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Lib. 7.</em></span>
Plinie telleth of an earthquake at Creta, which discouered the body of a
giant, that was 46. cubits in length after the Romane standard, and by
diuerse supposed to be the bodie of Orion or Ætion. Neuerthelesse I
read, that Lucius Flaccus and Metellus did sweare Per sua capita, that
it was either the carcase of some monster of the sea, or a forged deuise
to bleare the peoples eies withall, wherein it is wonderfull to see, how
they please Goropius as one that first deriued his fantasticall
imagination from their asseueration &amp; oth. The said Plinie also addeth
that the bodie of Orestes was seuen cubits in length, one Gabbara of
Arabia nine foot nine inches, and two reserued In conditorio
Sallustianorum halfe a foot longer than Gabbara was, for which I neuer
read that anie man was driuen to sweare.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Trallianus.</em></span>
Trallianus writeth how the Athenienses digging on a time in the ground,
to laie the foundation of a new wall to be made in a certeine Iland in
the daies of an emperour, did find the bones of Macrosyris in a coffin
of hard stone, of 100. cubits in length after the accompt of the Romane
cubit, which was then either a foot and a halfe, or not much in
difference from halfe a yard of our measure now in England. These verses
also, as they are now translated out of Gréeke were found withall,</p>

<p class="ind1">Sepultus ego Macrosyris in longa insula<br />
Vitæ peractis annis mille quinquies:</p>

<p>which amounteth to 81. yeares foure moneths, after the Aegyptian
reckoning.</p>

<p>In the time of Hadrian the emperour, the bodie of the giant Ida was
taken vp at Messana, conteining 20. foot in length, and hauing a double
row of teeth, yet standing whole in his chaps. Eumachus also in
Perigesi, telleth that when the Carthaginenses went about to dich in
their prouince, they found two bodies in seuerall coffins of stone, the
one was 23. the other 24. cubits in length, such another was found in
Bosphoro Cymmerio after an earthquake, but the inhabitants did cast
those bones into the Meotidan marris. In Dalmatia, manie graues were
shaken open with an earthquake, in diuers of which certeine carcases
were found, whose ribs conteined 16. els, after the Romane measure,
whereby the whole bodies were iudged to be 64. sith the longest rib is
commonlie about the fourth part of a man, as some rouing symmetricians
affirme.</p>

<p>Arrhianus saith, that in the time of Alexander the bodies of the Asianes
were generallie of huge stature, and commonlie of fiue cubits, and such
was the heigth of Porus of Inde, whom the said Alexander vanquished and
ouerthrew in battell.</p>

<p>Suidas speaketh of Ganges, killed also by the said prince, who farre
exceeded Porus; for he was ten cubits long. What should I speake of
Artaceas a capitaine in the host of Xerxes, afore remembred, whose
heigth was within 4. fingers bredth of fiue cubits, &amp; the tallest man in
the armie except the king himselfe. Herod. lib. 7. Of Athanatus whom
Plinie remembreth I saie nothing. But of all these, this one example
shall passe, which I doo read of in Trallianus, and he setteth downe in
forme and manner following.</p>

<p>In the daies of Tiberius th'emperor saith he, a corps was left bare or
laid open after an earthquake, of which ech tooth (taken one with
another) conteined 12. inches ouer at the least. Now forsomuch as in
<span class="page"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[Page 21]</span>
<span class="rightnote">A mouth of sixteene foot wide.</span>
such as be full mouthed, ech chap hath commonlie 16. teeth at the least,
which amount vnto 32. in the whole, needs must the widenesse of this
mans chaps be welneere of 16. foot, and the opening of his lips fiue at
the least. A large mouth in mine opinion, and not to eat peason with
Ladies of my time, besides that if occasion serued, it was able to
receiue the whole bodies of mo than one of the greatest men, I meane of
such as we be in our daies. When this carcase was thus found, euerie man
maruelled at it, &amp; good cause why. A messenger was sent to Tiberius the
<span class="leftnote">A counterfect made of a monstrous carcase by one tooth taken
out of the head.</span>
emperour also to know his pleasure, whether he would haue the same
brought ouer vnto Rome or not, but he forbad them, willing his Legate
not to remooue the dead out of his resting place, but rather somewhat to
satisfie his phantasie to send him a tooth out of his head, which being
done, he gaue it to a cunning workeman, commanding him to shape a
carcase of light matter, after the proportion of the tooth, that at the
least by such means he might satisfie his curious mind, and the
fantasies of such as are delited with nouelties. To be short, when the
<span class="rightnote">This man was more fauorable to this monster
than our papists were to the bodies of the dead who
tare them in peeces to make money of them.</span>
image was once made and set vp on end, it appéered rather an huge
colossie than the true carcase of a man, and when it had stood in Rome
vntill the people were wearie &amp; throughlie satisfied with the sight
thereof, he caused it to be broken all to peeces, and the tooth sent
againe to the carcase fr&#333; whence it came, willing them moreouer to
couer it diligentlie, and in anie wise not to dismember the corps, nor
from thencefoorth to be so hardie as to open the sepulchre anie more.
Pausan. lib. 8. telleth in like maner of Hiplodanus &amp; his fellowes, who
liued when Rhea was with child of Osyris by Cham, and were called to hir
aid at such time as she feared to be molested by Hammon hir first
<span class="leftnote">Grandiáque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris.</span>
husband, whilest she remained vpon the Thoumasian hill, "In ipso loco,"
saith he, "spectantur ossa maiora multo quàm vt humana existimari
possunt, &amp;c." Of Protophanes who had but one great and broad bone in
steed of all his ribs on ech side I saie nothing, sith it concerneth not
his stature.</p>

<p>I could rehearse manie mo examples of the bodies of such men, out of
Solinus, Sabellicus, D. Cooper, and others. As of Oetas and Ephialtes,
who were said to be nine orgies or paces in heigth, and foure in bredth,
which are taken for so many cubits, bicause there is small difference
betwéene a mans ordinarie pace and his cubit, and finallie of our
Richard the first, who is noted to beare an axe in the wars, the iron of
whose head onelie weighed twentie pound after our greatest weight, and
whereof an old writer that I haue seene, saith thus:</p>

<p class="ind1">This king Richard I vnderstand,<br />
Yer he went out of England,<br />
Let make an axe for the nones,<br />
Therewith to cleaue the Saracens bones,<br />
The head in sooth was wrought full weele,<br />
Thereon were twentie pound of steele,<br />
And when he came in Cyprus land,<br />
That ilkon axe he tooke in hand, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I could speake also of Gerards staffe or lance, yet to be seene in
Gerards hall at London in Basing lane, which is so great and long that
no man can beweld it, neither go to the top thereof without a ladder,
which of set purpose and for greater countenance of the wonder is fixed
by the same. I haue seene a man my selfe of seuen foot in heigth, but
lame of his legs. The chronicles also of Cogshall speake of one in
Wales, who was halfe a foot higher, but through infirmitie and wounds
not able to beweld himselfe. I might (if I thought good) speake also of
another of no lesse heigth than either of these and liuing of late
yeares, but these here remembred shall suffice to prooue my purpose
withall. I might tell you in like sort of the marke stone which Turnus
threw at Æneas, and was such as that twelue chosen and picked men (saith
Virgil),<br /><span class="leftnote">Vis vnita fortior est eadem dispersa.</span></p>

<p>were not able to stur and remooue out of the place: but I passe it ouer,
and diuerse of the like, concluding that these huge blocks were ordeined
and created by God: first for a testimonie vnto vs of his power and
might; and secondlie for a confirmation, that hugenes of bodie is not to
be accompted of as a part of our felicitie, sith they which possessed
the same, were not onelie tyrants, doltish, &amp; euill men, but also
oftentimes ouercome euen by the weake &amp; feeble. Finallie they were such
indéed as in whom the Lord delited not, according to the saieng of the
<span class="leftnote"><em>Cap. 3, 36.</em></span>
prophet Baruch; "Ibi fuerunt gigantes nominati, illi qui ab initio
fuerunt statura magna, scientes bellum, hos non elegit Dominus, neque
illis viam disciplinæ dedit, propterea perierunt, et quoniam non
habuerunt sapientiam, interierunt propter suam insipientiam, &amp;c." that
is, "There were the giants famous from the beginning, that were of great
stature and expert in warre, those did not the Lord choose, neither gaue
he the waie of knowledge vnto them, but they were destroied, because
they had no wisedome, and perished through their owne foolishnesse."
That the bodies of men also doo dailie decaie in stature, beside
<span class="leftnote"><em>4. Esd. cap. 5.</em></span>
Plinie lib. 7. Esdras likewise confesseth lib. 4. cap. 5. whose
authoritie is so good herein as that of Homer or Plinie, who doo affirme
so much, whereas Goropius still continuing his woonted pertinacitie also
in this behalfe, maketh his proportion first by the old Romane foot, and
then by his owne, &amp; therevpon concludeth that men in these daies be
fullie so great as euer they were, whereby as in the former dealing he
thinketh it nothing to conclude against the scriptures, chosen writers
and testimonies of the oldest pagans. But see how he would salue all at
last in the end of his Gigantomachia, where he saith, I denie not but
that od huge personages haue bene seene, as a woman of ten, and a man of
nine foot long, which I my selfe also haue beholden, but as now so in
old time the common sort did so much woonder at the like as we doo at
these, because they were seldome séene, and not commonlie to be heard
of.</p>

<small>OF THE LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN THIS ILAND.</small><br />

CAP. VI.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">British.</span>
What language came first with Samothes and afterward with Albion, and
the giants of his companie, it is hard for me to determine, sith nothing
of sound credit remaineth in writing, which may resolue vs in the truth
<span class="leftnote">Small difference betweene the British and Celtike languages.</span>
hereof. Yet of so much are we certeine, that the speach of the ancient
Britons, and of the Celts, had great affinitie one with another, so that
they were either all one, or at leastwise such as either nation with
small helpe of interpretors might vnderstand other, and readilie
discerne what the speaker meant. Some are of the opinion that the Celts
spake Greeke, and how the British toong resembled the same, which was
spoken in Grecia before Homer did reforme it: but I see that these men
doo speake without authoritie and therefore I reiect them, for if the
Celts which were properlie called Galles did speake Gréeke, why did
Cesar in his letters sent to Rome vse that language, because that if
they should be intercepted they might not vnderstand them, or why did he
not vnderstand the Galles, he being so skilfull in the language without
an interpretor? Yet I denie not but that the Celtish and British
speaches might haue great affinitie one with another, and the British
aboue all other with the Greeke, for both doo appéere by certeine words,
as first in tri for three, march for an horsse, &amp; trimarchia, whereof
Pausanias speaketh, for both. Atheneus also writeth of Bathanasius a
capitaine of the Galles, whose name is méere British, compounded of Bath
&amp; Ynad, &amp; signifieth a noble or comelie iudge. And wheras he saith that
the reliques of the Galles tooke vp their first dwelling about Isther,
and afterward diuided themselues in such wise, that they which went and
dwelled in Hungarie were called Sordsai, and the other that inhabited
within the dominion of Tyroll) Brenni, whose seate was on the mount
Brenhere parcell of the Alpes, what else signifieth the word Iscaredich
in British, from whence the word Scordisci commeth, but to be diuided?
<span class="page"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[Page 23]</span>
Hereby then, and sundrie other the like testimonies, I gather that the
British and the Celtish speaches had great affinitie one with another,
as I said, which Cesar (speaking of the similitude or likenesse of
religion in both nations) doth also auerre, &amp; Tacitus in vita Agricolæ,
in like sort plainlie affirmeth, or else it must needs be that the
Galles which inuaded Italie and Greece were meere Britons, of whose
likenes of speech with the Gréeke toong I need not make anie triall,
sith no man (I hope) will readilie denie it. Appianus talking of the
Brenni calleth them Cymbres, and by this I gather also that the Celts
and the Britons were indifferentlie called Cymbri in their own language,
or else that the Britons were the right Cymbri, who vnto this daie doo
not refuse to be called by that name. Bodinus writing of the means by
which the originall of euerie kingdome and nation is to be had and
discerned, setteth downe thrée waies whereby the knowledge thereof is to
be found, one is (saith he) the infallible testimonie of the sound
writers, the other the description and site of the region, the third the
relikes of the ancient speech remaining in the same. Which later if it
be of any force, then I must conclude, that the spéech of the Britons
and Celts was sometime either all one or verie like one to another, or
else it must follow that the Britons ouerflowed the continent vnder the
name of Cymbres, being peraduenture associat in this voiage, or mixed by
inuasion with the Danes, and Norwegiens, who are called Cymbri and
Cymmerij, as most writers doo remember. This also is euident (as
Plutarch likewise confesseth In vita Marij) that no man knew from whence
the Cymbres came in his daies, and therfore I beleeue that they came out
of Britaine, for all the maine was well knowne vnto them, I meane euen
to the vttermost part of the north, as may appeare furthermore by the
slaues which were dailie brought from thence vnto them, whom of their
countries they called Daui for Daci, Getæ for Gothes, &amp;c: for of their
conquests I need not make rehearsall, sith they are commonlie knowne and
remembred by the writers, both of the Greekes and Latines.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">British corrupted by the Latine and Saxon speeches.</span>
The British toong called Camberaec dooth yet remaine in that part of the
Iland, which is now called Wales, whither the Britons were driuen after
the Saxons had made a full conquest of the other, which we now call
England, although the pristinate integritie thereof be not a little
diminished by mixture of the Latine and Saxon speaches withall. Howbeit,
manie poesies and writings (in making whereof that nation hath euermore
delited) are yet extant in my time, wherby some difference betwéene the
ancient and present language may easilie be discerned, notwithstanding
that among all these there is nothing to be found, which can set downe
anie sound and full testimonie of their owne originall, in remembrance
whereof, their Bards and cunning men haue béene most slacke and
negligent. Giraldus in praising the Britons affirmeth that there is not
one word in all their language, that is not either Gréeke or Latine.
Which being rightly vnderstanded and conferred with the likenesse that
was in old time betwéene the Celts &amp; the British toongs, will not a
little helpe those that thinke the old Celtish to haue some sauour of
the Gréeke. But how soeuer that matter standeth, after the British
speach came once ouer into this Iland, sure it is, that it could neuer
be extinguished for all the attempts that the Romans, Saxons, Normans,
and Englishmen could make against that nation, in anie maner of wise.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The Britons diligent in petigrées.</span>
Petigrées and genealogies also the Welsh Britons haue plentie in their
owne toong, insomuch that manie of them can readilie deriue the same,
either from Brute or some of his band, euen vnto Æneas and other of the
Troians, and so foorth vnto Noah without anie maner of stop. But as I
know not what credit is to be giuen vnto them in this behalfe, although
I must néeds confesse that their ancient Bards were verie diligent in
there collection, and had also publike allowance or salarie for the
same; so I dare not absolutelie impugne their assertions, sith that in
times past all nations (learning it no doubt of the Hebrues) did verie
solemnelie preserue the catalogs of their descents, thereby either to
shew themselues of ancient and noble race, or else to be descended from
some one of the gods. But</p>

<p class="ind1">Stemmata quid faciunt? quid prodest Pontice longo<br />

<p><span class="page"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[Page 24]</span></p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Latine.</span>
Next vnto the British speach, the Latine toong was brought in by the
Romans, and in maner generallie planted through the whole region, as the
French was after by the Normans. Of this toong I will not say much,
bicause there are few which be not skilfull in the same. Howbeit, as the
speach it selfe is easie and delectable, so hath it peruerted the names
of the ancient riuers, regions, &amp; cities of Britaine in such wise, that
in these our daies their old British denominations are quite growne out
of memorie, and yet those of the new Latine left as most vncertaine.
This remaineth also vnto my time, borowed from the Romans, that all our
déeds, euidences, charters, &amp; writings of record, are set downe in the
Latine toong, though now verie barbarous, and therevnto the copies and
court-rolles, and processes of courts and leets registred in the same.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The Saxon toong.</span>
The third language apparantlie knowne is the Scithian or high Dutch,
induced at the first by the Saxons (which the Britons call Saysonaec, as
they doo the speakers Sayson) an hard and rough kind of speach, God wot,
when our nation was brought first into acquaintance withall, but now
changed with vs into a farre more fine and easie kind of vtterance, and
so polished and helped with new and milder words, that it is to be
aduouched how there is no one speach vnder the sunne spoken in our time,
that hath or can haue more varietie of words, copie of phrases, or
figures and floures of eloquence, than hath our English toong, although
some haue affirmed vs rather to barke as dogs, than talke like men,
bicause the most of our words (as they doo indéed) incline vnto one
syllable. This also is to be noted as a testimonie remaining still of
our language, deriued from the Saxons, that the generall name for the

<p><span class="leftnote">The French toong.</span>
After the Saxon toong, came the Norman or French language ouer into our
countrie, and therein were our lawes written for a long time. Our
children also were by an especiall decrée taught first to speake the
same, and therevnto inforced to learne their constructions in the
French, whensoeuer they were set to the Grammar schoole. In like sort
few bishops, abbats, or other clergie men, were admitted vnto anie
ecclesiasticall function here among vs, but such as came out of
religious houses from beyond the seas, to the end they should not vse
the English toong in their sermons to the people. In the court also it
grew into such contempt, that most men thought it no small dishonor to
speake any English there. Which brauerie tooke his hold at the last
likewise in the countrie with euerie plowman, that euen the verie
carters began to wax wearie of there mother toong, &amp; laboured to speake
French, which as then was counted no small token of gentilitie. And no
maruell, for euerie French rascall, when he came once hither, was taken
for a gentleman, onelie bicause he was proud, and could vse his owne
language, and all this (I say) to exile the English and British speaches
quite out of the countrie. But in vaine, for in the time of king Edward
the first, to wit, toward the latter end of his reigne, the French it
selfe ceased to be spoken generallie, but most of all and by law in the
midst of Edward the third, and then began the English to recouer and
grow in more estimation than before; notwithstanding that among our
artificers, the most part of their implements, tooles and words of art
reteine still their French denominations euen to these our daies, as the
language it selfe is vsed likewise in sundrie courts, bookes of record,
and matters of law; whereof here is no place to make any particular
<span class="leftnote">The helpers of our English toong.</span>
rehearsall. Afterward also, by diligent trauell of Geffray Chaucer, and
Iohn Gowre, in the time of Richard the second, and after them of Iohn
Scogan, and Iohn Lydgate monke of Berrie, our said toong was brought to
an excellent passe, notwithstanding that it neuer came vnto the type of
perfection, vntill the time of Quéene Elizabeth, wherein Iohn Iewell B.
of Sarum, Iohn Fox, and sundrie learned &amp; excellent writers haue fullie
accomplished the ornature of the same, to their great praise and
immortall commendation; although not a few other doo greatlie séeke to
staine the same, by fond affectation of forren and strange words,
presuming that to be the best English, which is most corrupted with
<span class="page"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[Page 25]</span>
externall termes of eloquence, and sound of manie syllables. But as this
excellencie of the English toong is found in one, and the south part of
this Iland; so in Wales the greatest number (as I said) retaine still
their owne ancient language, that of the north part of the said countrie
being lesse corrupted than the other, and therefore reputed for the
better in their owne estimation and iudgement. This also is proper to vs
<span class="leftnote">Englishmen apt to learne any forren toong.</span>
Englishmen, that sith ours is a meane language, and neither too rough
nor too smooth in vtterance, we may with much facilitie learne any other
language, beside Hebrue, Gréeke &amp; Latine, and speake it naturallie, as
if we were home-borne in those countries; &amp; yet on the other side it
falleth out, I wot not by what other meanes, that few forren nations can
rightlie pronounce ours, without some and that great note of
imperfection, especiallie the French men, who also seldome write any
thing that sauoreth of English trulie. It is a pastime to read how
Natalis Comes in like maner, speaking of our affaires, dooth clip the
names of our English lords. But this of all the rest dooth bréed most
admiration with me, that if any stranger doo hit vpon some likelie
pronuntiation of our toong, yet in age he swarueth so much from the
same, that he is woorse therein than euer he was, and thereto
peraduenture halteth not a litle also in his owne, as I haue séene by
experience in Reginald Wolfe, and other, whereof I haue iustlie
maruelled.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The Cornish toong.</span>
The Cornish and Deuonshire men, whose countrie the Britons call Cerniw,
haue a speach in like sort of their owne, and such as hath in déed more
affinitie with the Armoricane toong than I can well discusse of. Yet in
mine opinion, they are both but a corrupted kind of Brittish, albeit so
far degenerating in these daies from the old, that if either of them doo
méete with a Welshman, they are not able at the first to vnderstand one
an other, except here and there in some od words, without the helpe of
interpretors. And no maruell in mine opinion that the British of
Cornewall is thus corrupted, sith the Welsh toong that is spoken in the
north &amp; south part of Wales, doth differ so much in it selfe, as the
English vsed in Scotland dooth from that which is spoken among vs here
in this side of the Iland, as I haue said alreadie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Scottish english.</span>
The Scottish english hath beene much broader and lesse pleasant in
vtterance than ours, because that nation hath not till of late indeuored
to bring the same to any perfect order, and yet it was such in maner, as
Englishmen themselues did speake for the most part beyond the Trent,
whither any great amendement of our language had not as then extended it
selfe. Howbeit in our time the Scottish language endeuoreth to come
neere, if not altogither to match our toong in finenesse of phrase, and
copie of words, and this may in part appeare by an historie of the
Apocripha translated into Scottish verse by Hudson, dedicated to the
king of that countrie, and conteining sixe books, except my memorie doo
faile me.</p>

<p>Thus we sée how that vnder the dominion of the king of England, and in
the south parts of the realme, we haue thrée seuerall toongs, that is to
saie, English, British, and Cornish, and euen so manie are in Scotland,
if you accompt the English speach for one: notwithstanding that for
bredth and quantitie of the region, I meane onelie of the soile of the
maine Iland, it be somewhat lesse to see to than the other. For in the
<span class="leftnote">The wild Scots.<br />
Redshanks.<br />
Rough footed Scots.</span>
north part of the region, where the wild Scots, otherwise called the
Redshanks, or rough footed Scots (because they go bare footed and clad
in mantels ouer their saffron shirts after the Irish maner) doo inhabit,
<span class="rightnote"><br />Irish Scots.<br />
Irish speech.</span>
they speake good Irish which they call Gachtlet, as they saie of one
Gathelus, whereby they shew their originall to haue in times past béene
fetched out of Ireland: as I noted also in the chapiter precedent, and
wherevnto Vincentius cap. de insulis Oceani dooth yéeld his assent,
saieng that Ireland was in time past called Scotia; "Scotia eadem (saith
he) &amp; Hibernia, proxima Britanniæ insula, spatio terrarum angustior, sed
situ f&oelig;cundior; Scotia autem à Scotorum gentibus traditur appellata,
&amp;c." Out of the 14. booke of Isidorus intituled Originum, where he also
addeth that it is called Hybernia, because it bendeth toward Iberia. But
I find elsewhere that it is so called by certeine Spaniards which came
to seeke and plant their inhabitation in the same, wherof in my
Chronologie I haue spoken more at large.</p>

<p>In the Iles of the Orchades, or Orkeney, as we now call them, &amp; such
<span class="page"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[Page 26]</span>
coasts of Britaine as doo abbut vpon the same, the Gottish or Danish
speach is altogither in vse, and also in Shetland, by reason (as I take
it) that the princes of Norwaie held those Ilands so long vnder their
subiection, albeit they were otherwise reputed as rather to belong to
Ireland, bicause that the verie soile of them is enimie to poison, as
some write, although for my part I had neuer any sound experience of the
truth hereof. And thus much haue I thought good to speake of our old
speaches, and those fiue languages now vsuallie spoken within the limits
of our Iland.</p>

<small>INTO HOW MANIE KINGDOMS THIS ILAND HATH BEENE DIUIDED.</small><br />

CAP. VII.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">Britaine at the first one entire kingdome.</span>
It is not to be doubted, but that at the first, the whole Iland was
ruled by one onelie prince, and so continued from time to time, vntill
ciuill discord, grounded vp&#333; ambitious desire to reigne, caused the
same to be gouerned by diuerse. And this I meane so well of the time
before the comming of Brute, as after the extinction of his whole race &amp;
posteritie. Howbeit, as it is vncerteine into how manie regions it was
seuered, after the first partition; so it is most sure that this latter
disturbed estate of regiment, continued in the same, not onelie vntill
the time of Cæsar, but also in maner vnto the daies of Lucius, with
whome the whole race of the Britons had an end, and the Romans full
possession of this Iland, who gouerned it by Legats after the maner of a
prouince. It should séeme also that within a while after the time of
Dunwallon (who rather brought those foure princes that vsurped in his
time to obedience, than extinguished their titles, &amp; such partition as
they had made of the Iland among themselues) each great citie had hir
fréedome and seuerall kind of regiment, proper vnto hir selfe, beside a
large circuit of the countrie appertinent vnto the same, wherein were
sundrie other cities also of lesse name, which owght homage and all
subiection vnto the greater sort. And to saie truth, hereof it came to
passe, that each of these regions, whereinto this Iland was then
diuided, tooke his name of some one of these cities; although Ciuitas
after Cæsar doth sometime signifie an whole continent or kingdome,
whereby there were in old time Tot ciuitates quot regna, and
contrariwise as may appeare by that of the Trinobantes, which was so
called of Trinobantum the chiefe citie of that portion, whose
territories conteined all Essex, Middlesex, and part of Hertfordshire,
euen as the iurisdiction of the bishop of London is now extended, for
the ouersight of such things as belong vnto the church. Ech of the
gouernors also of these regions, called themselues kings, and therevnto
either of them dailie made warre vpon other, for the inlarging of their
limits. But for somuch as I am not able to saie how manie did challenge
this authoritie at once, and how long they reigned ouer their seuerall
portions, I will passe ouer these ancient times, and come néerer vnto
our owne, I meane the 600. yéere of Christ, whereof we haue more
certeine notice, &amp; at which season there is euident proofe, that there
were twelue or thirtéene kings reigning in this Iland.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Wales diuided into three kingdomes.</span>
We find therefore for the first, how that Wales had hir thrée seuerall
kingdomes, which being accompted togither conteined (as Giraldus saith)
49. cantreds or cantons (whereof thrée were in his time possessed by the
French and English) although that whole portion of the Iland extended in
those daies no farder than about 200. miles in length, and one hundred
in bredth, and was cut from Lhoegres by the riuers Sauerne and Dee, of
which two streames this dooth fall into the Irish sea at Westchester,
the other into the maine Ocean, betwixt Somersetshire and Southwales, as
their seuerall courses shall witnesse more at large.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Gwinhed.</span>
In the begining it was diuided into two kingdoms onelie, that is to
saie, Venedotia or Gwynhedh (otherwise called <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Dehenbarth'">Deheubarth</ins>) and Demetia,
for which we now vse most c&#333;monlie the names of South &amp; Northwales.
But in a short processe of time a third sprung vp in the verie middest
betwéene them both, which from thence-foorth was called Powisy, as
shalbe shewed hereafter. For Roderijc the great, who flourished 850. of
<span class="page"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[Page 27]</span>
Christ, and was king of all Wales (which then conteined onlie six
regions) leauing thrée sons behind him, by his last will &amp; testament
diuided the countrie into thrée portions, according to the number of his
children, of which he assigned one vnto either of them, wherby Morwing
or Morwinner had Gwynhedh or Northwales, Cadelh Demetia or Southwales,
and Anaralt Powisy, as Giraldus and other doo remember. Howbeit it came
to passe that after this diuision, Cadelh suruiued all his brethren, and
thereby became lord of both their portions, and his successors after him
vntill the time of Teuther or Theodor (all is one) after which they were
contented to kéepe themselues within the compasse of Demetia, which (as
I said) conteined 29. of those 49. cantreds before mentioned, as Powisy
did six, and Gwinhedh fourtéene, except my memorie doo faile me.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Venedotia.</span>
The first of these thrée, being called (as I said) Northwales or
Venedotia (or as Paulus Iouius saith Malfabrene, for he diuideth Wales
also into thrée regions, of which he calleth the first Dumbera, the
second Berfrona, and the third Malfabrene) lieth directlie ouer against
<span class="leftnote">Anglesei.</span>
the Ile of Anglesei, the chiefe citie whereof stood in the Ile of
Anglesei and was called Aberfraw. It conteineth 4. regions, of which the
said Iland is the first, and whereof in the chapter insuing I wille
<span class="leftnote">Arfon.</span>
intreat more at large. The second is called Arfon, and situate betweene
<span class="leftnote"><br />Merioneth.</span>
two riuers, the Segwy and the Conwy. The third is Merioneth, and as it
<span class="rightnote"><br />Stradcluyd or Tegenia.</span>
is seuered from Arfon by the Conwy, so is it separated from Tegenia
(otherwise called Stradcluyd and Igenia the fourth region) by the riuer
Cluda. Finallie, the limits of this latter are extended also euen vnto
the Dée it selfe, and of these foure regions consisteth the kingdome of
Venedotia, whereof in times past the region of the Canges was not the
smallest portion.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Powisy.</span>
The kingdome of Powisy, last of all erected, as I said, hath on the
north side Gwinhedh, on the east (from Chester to Hereford, or rather to
Deane forest) England, on the south and west the riuer Wy and verie high
hilles, whereby it is notablie seuered from Southwales, the chiefe citie
thereof being at the first Salopsburg, in old time Pengwerne, and
Ynwithig, but now Shrowesburie, a citie or towne raised out of the
ruines of Vricouium, which (standing 4. miles from thence, and by the
Saxons called Wrekencester and Wrokecester, before they ouerthrew it) is
now inhabited with méere English, and where in old time the kings of
Powisy did dwell and hold their palaces, till Englishmen draue them from
thence to Matrauall in the same prouince, where they from thencefoorth
aboad. Vpon the limits of this kingdome, and not far from Holt castell,
vpon ech side of the riuer, as the chanell now runneth, stood sometime
<span class="leftnote">Bangor.</span>
the famous monasterie of Bangor, whilest the abated glorie of the
Britons yet remained vnextinguished, and herein were 2100. monkes, of
which, the learned sort did preach the Gospell, and the vnlearned
labored with their hands, thereby to mainteine themselues, and to
sustaine their preachers. This region was in like sort diuided afterward
<span class="leftnote">Mailrosse.</span>
in twaine, of which, the one was called Mailor or Mailrosse, the other
reteined still hir old denomination, and of these the first laie by
south, &amp; the latter by north of the Sauerne.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Fowkes de Warren.</span>
As touching Mailrosse, I read moreouer in the gests of Fowkes de Warren,
how that one William sonne to a certeine ladie sister to Paine Peuerell,
the first lord of Whittington, after the conquest did win a part of the
same, and the hundred of Ellesmore from the Welshmen, in which
enterprise he was so desperatlie wounded, that no man hight him life;
yet at the last by eating of the shield of a wild bore, he got an
appetite and recouered his health. This William had issue two daughters,
<span class="leftnote">Helene.<br />
Mellent.</span>
to wit, Helene maried to the heir of the Alans, and Mellent which
refused mariage with anie man, except he were first tried to be a knight
of prowesse. Herevpon hir father made proclamation, that against such a
daie &amp; at such a place, whatsoeuer Gentleman could shew himselfe most
valiant in the field, should marrie Mellent his daughter, &amp; haue with
hir his castell of Whittington with sufficient liueliehood to mainteine
their estates for euer. This report being spred, Fowkes de Warren came
thither all in red, with a shield of siluer and pecocke for his crest,
whereof he was called the red knight, and there ouercomming the kings
sonne of Scotland, and a Baron of Burgundie, he maried the maid, and by
hir had issue as in the treatise appeareth. There is yet great mention
of the red knight in the countrie there about; and much like vnto this
<span class="page"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[Page 28]</span>
Mellent was the daughter sometime of one of the lord Rosses, called
<span class="rightnote">The originall of Fitz Henries.</span>
Kudall, who bare such good will to Fitz-Henrie clarke of hir fathers
kitchen, that she made him carie hir awaie on horssebacke behind him,
onlie for his manhood sake, which presentlie was tried. For being
pursued &amp; ouer taken, she made him light, &amp; held his cloke whilest he
killed and draue hir fathers men to flight: and then awaie they go, till
hir father conceiuing a good opinion of Fitz-Henrie for this act,
receiued him to his fauour, whereby that familie came vp. And thus much
(by the waie) of Mailrosse, whereof this may suffice, sith mine intent
is not as now to make anie precise description of the particulars of
Wales; but onelie to shew how those regions laie, which sometime were
<span class="leftnote">Demetia.</span>
knowne to be gouerned in that countrie. The third kingdome is Demetia, or
Southwales, sometime knowne for the region of the Syllures, wherevnto I
also am persuaded, that the Ordolukes laie in the east part thereof, and
extended their region euen vnto the Sauerne: but howsoeuer that matter
falleth out, Demetia hath the Sauerne on hir south, the Irish sea on hir
west parts, on the east the Sauerne onelie, and by north the land of
Powisy, whereof I spake of late.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Cair Maridunum.</span>
Of this region also Caermarden, which the old writers call Maridunum,
was the chéefe citie and palace belonging to the kings of Southwales,
vntill at the last through forren and ciuill inuasions of enimies, the
princes thereof were constrained to remooue their courts to Dinefar
(which is in Cantermawr, and situate neuerthelesse vpon the same riuer
Tewy, wheron Caermarden standeth) in which place it is far better
defended with high hils, thicke woods, craggie rocks, and déepe marises.
In this region also lieth Pembroke aliàs Penmoroc shire, whose fawcons
haue béene in old time very much regarded, and therein likewise is
Milford hauen, whereof the Welsh wisards doo yet dreame strange toies,
which they beleeue shall one daie come to passe. For they are a nation
much giuen to fortelling of things to come, but more to beléeue such
blind prophesies as haue béene made of old time, and no man is accompted
for learned in Wales that is not supposed to haue the spirit of
prophesie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Pictland.<br />
Scotland.<br />
Picts.<br />
Scots.</span>
That Scotland had in those daies two kingdoms, (besides that of the
Orchades) whereof the one consisted of the Picts, and was called
Pightland or Pictland, the other of the Irish race, and named Scotland:
I hope no wise man will readilie denie. The whole region or portion of
the Ile beyond the Scotish sea also was so diuided, that the Picts laie
on the east side, and the Scots on the west, ech of them being seuered
from other, either by huge hils or great lakes and riuers, that ran out
of the south into the north betwéene them. It séemeth also that at the
first these two kingdoms were diuided from the rest of those of the
Britons by the riuers Cluda and Forth, till both of them desirous to
inlarge their dominions, draue the Britons ouer the Solue and the Twede,
which then became march betweene both the nations. Wherefore the case
being so plaine, I will saie no more of these two, but procéed in order
with the rehersall of the rest of the particular kingdoms of this our
south part of the Ile, limiting out the same by shires as they now lie,
so néere as I can, for otherwise it shall be vnpossible for me to leaue
certaine notice of the likeliest quantities of these their seuerall
portions.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Kent Henghist.</span>
The first of these kingdoms therefore was begunne in Kent by Henghist in
the 456. of Christ, and thereof called the kingdome of Kent or
Cantwarland, and as the limits thereof extended it selfe no farther than
the said countie (the cheefe citie whereof was Dorobernia or Cantwarbyry
now Canturburie) so it indured well néere by the space of 400. yeares,
before it was made an earledome or Heretochie, and vnited by Inas vnto
that of the West Saxons, Athelstane his sonne, being the first Earle or
Heretoch of the same. Maister Lambert in his historie of Kent dooth
gather, by verie probable coniectures, that this part of the Iland was
first inhabited by Samothes, and afterward by Albion. But howsoeuer that
case standeth, sure it is that it hath béen the onelie doore, whereby
the Romans and Saxons made their entrie vnto the conquest of the region,
but first of all Cæsar, who entred into this Iland vpon the eightéenth
Cal. or 14. of September, which was foure daies before the full of the
moone, as he himselfe confesseth, and then fell out about the 17. or 18.
of that moneth, twelue daies before the equinoctiall (apparant) so that
<span class="page"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[Page 29]</span>
he did not tarrie at that time aboue eight or ten daies in Britaine. And
as this platforme cannot be denied for his entrance, so the said region
and east part of Kent, was the onelie place by which the knowledge of
Christ was first brought ouer vnto vs, whereby we became partakers of
saluation, and from the darkenesse of mistie errour, true conuerts vnto
the light and bright beames of the shining truth, to our eternall
benefit and euerlasting comforts.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Southsax.<br />
Ella.</span>
The second kingdome conteined onelie Sussex, and a part of (or as some
saie all) Surrie, which Ella the Saxon first held: who also erected his
chéefe palace at Chichester, when he had destroied Andredswald in the
492. of Christ. And after it had continued by the space of 232. years,
it ceased, being the verie least kingdome of all the rest, which were
founded in this Ile after the comming of the Saxons (for to saie truth,
it conteined little aboue 7000. families) &amp; within a while after the
erection of the kingdome of the Gewisses or Westsaxons, notwithstanding
that before the kings of Sussex pretended and made claime to all that
which laie west of Kent, and south of the Thames, vnto the point of
Corinwall, as I haue often read.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Eastsax.<br />
Erkenwiin.</span>
The third regiment was of the East Saxons, or Tribonantes. This
kingdome began vnder Erkenwijn, whose chéefe seat was in London (or
rather Colchester) and conteined whole Essex, Middlesex, and part of
Herfordshire. It indured also much about the pricke of 303. yeares, and
was diuided from that of the East Angles onlie by the riuer Stoure, as
Houeden and others doo report, &amp; so it continueth separated from
Suffolke euen vnto our times, although the said riuer be now growne
verie small, and not of such greatnesse as it hath béene in times past,
by reason that our countriemen make small accompt of riuers, thinking
carriage made by horsse and cart to be the lesse chargeable waie. But
herin how far they are deceiued, I will else-where make manifest
declaration.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Westsax.</span>
The fourth kingdome was of the West Saxons, and so called, bicause it
laie in the west part of the realme, as that of Essex did in the east,
<span class="leftnote"><br />Cerdiic.</span>
and of Sussex in the south. It began in the yeare of Grace 519. vnder
Cerdijc, and indured vntill the comming of the Normans, including at the
last all Wiltshire, Barkeshire, Dorset, Southampton, Somersetshire,
Glocestershire, some part of Deuonshire (which the Britons occupied not)
Cornewall, and the rest of Surrie, as the best authors doo set downe. At
the first it conteined onelie Wiltshire, Dorcetshire, and Barkeshire,
but yer long the princes thereof conquered whatsoeuer the kings of
Sussex and the Britons held vnto the point of Cornewall, and then became
first Dorchester (vntill the time of Kinigils) then Winchester the
chéefe citie of that kingdome. For when Birinus the moonke came into
England, the said Kinigils gaue him Dorchester, and all the land within
seauen miles about, toward the maintenance of his cathedrall sea, by
meanes whereof he himselfe remooued his palace to Winchester.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Brennicia, aliàs Northumberland.</span>
The fift kingdome began vnder Ida, in the 548. of Christ, and was called
Northumberland, bicause it laie by north of the riuer Humber. And from
<span class="rightnote"><br />Ida.</span>
the comming of Henghist to this Ida, it was onlie gouerned by earls or
Heretoches as an Heretochy, till the said Ida conuerted it into a
kingdome. It conteined all that region which (as it should séeme) was in
time past either wholie apperteining to the Brigants, or whereof the
said Brigants did possesse the greater part. The cheefe citie of the
same in like maner was Yorke, as Beda, Capgraue, Leyland, and others doo
set downe, who ad thereto that it extended from the Humber vnto the
Scotish sea, vntill the slaughter of Egfride of the Northumbers, after
which time the Picts gat hold of all, betweene the Forth and the Twede,
which afterward descending to the Scots by meanes of the vtter
destruction of the Picts, hath not béene sithens vnited to the crowne of
England, nor in possession of the meere English, as before time it had
béene. Such was the crueltie of these Picts also in their recouerie of
the same, that at a certeine houre they made a Sicilien euensong, and
slew euerie English man, woman and child, that they could laie hold vpon
within the aforesaid region, but some escaped narrowlie, and saued
themselues by flight.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Deira.</span>
Afterward in the yeare of Grace 560. it was parted in twaine, vnder Adda,
that yeelded vp all his portion, which lay betweene Humber and the Tine
<span class="rightnote"><br />Ella.</span>
vnto his brother Ella (according to their fathers appointment) who
<span class="page"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[Page 30]</span>
called it Deira, or Southumberland, but reteining the rest still vnto
his owne vse, he diminished not his title, but wrote himselfe as before
king of all Northumberland. Howbeit after 91. yeares, it was revnited
againe, and so continued vntill Alfred annexed the whole to his
kingdome, in the 331. after Ida, or 878. of the birth of Jesus Christ
our Sauiour.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Eastangles Offa, à quo Offlingæ.</span>
The seauenth kingdome, called of the East-Angles, began at Norwich in
the 561. after Christ, vnder Offa, of whom the people of that region
were long time called Offlings. This included all Norfolke, Suffolke,
Cambridgeshire, and Elie, and continuing 228. yeares, it flourished
onelie 35. yeares in perfect estate of liberte, the rest being consumed
vnder the tribut and vassallage of the Mercians, who had the
souereigntie thereof, and held it with great honour, till the Danes gat
hold of it, who spoiled it verie sore, so that it became more miserable
than any of the other, and so remained till the kings of the West-saxons
vnited it to their crownes. Some saie that Grantcester, but now
Cambridge (a towne erected out of hir ruines) was the chéefe citie of
this kingdome, and not Norwich. Wherein I may well shew the discord of
writers, but I cannot resolue the scruple. Some take this region also to
be all one with that of the Icenes, but as yet for my part I cannot
yeeld to their assertions, I meane it of Leland himselfe, whose helpe I
vse chéefelie in these collections, albeit in this behalfe I am not
resolued that he doth iudge aright.</p>

<p>The 8. &amp; last was that of Mertia, which indured 291. yeares, and for
greatnesse exceeded all the rest. It tooke the name either of Mearc the
Saxon word, bicause it was march to the rest (and trulie, the limits of
most of the other kingdomes abutted vpon the same) or else for that the
<span class="leftnote">Mertia.</span>
lawes of Martia the Queene were first vsed in that part of the Iland.
But as this later is but a méere coniecture of some, so the said
<span class="leftnote">Creodda.</span>
kingdome began vnder Creodda, in the 585. of Christ, &amp; indured well
néere 300. yeares before it was vnited to that of the West-saxons by
Alfred, then reigning in this Ile. Before him the Danes had gotten hold
thereof, and placed one Ceolulph an idiot in the same; but as he was
soone reiected for his follie, so it was not long after yer the said
Alfred (I saie) annexed it to his kingdome by his manhood. The limits
<span class="leftnote">Limits of Mertia.</span>
of the Mertian dominions included Lincolne, Northampton, Chester,
Darbie, Nottingham, Stafford, Huntington, Rutland, Oxford, Buckingham,
Worcester, Bedford shires, and the greatest part of Shropshire (which
the Welsh occupied not) Lancaster, Glocester, Hereford (alias Hurchford)
Warwijc and Hertford shires: the rest of whose territories were holden
by such princes of other kingdomes through force as bordered vpon the
same. Moreouer, this kingdome was at one time diuided into south and
north Mertia, whereof this laie beyond and the other on this side of the
Trent, which later also Oswald of Northumberland did giue to Weada the
sonne of Penda for kindred sake, though he not long inioied it. This
also is worthie to be noted, that in these eight kingdomes of the
Saxons, there were twelue princes reputed in the popish Catalog for
saints or martyrs, of which Alcimund, Edwine, Oswald, Oswijn and Aldwold
reigned in Northumberland; Sigebert, Ethelbert, Edmond, and another
Sigebert among the Estangels; Kenelme and Wistan in Mertia; and Saint
Edward the confessor, ouer all; but how worthilie, I referre me to the
iudgement of the learned. Thus much haue I thought good to leaue in
memorie of the aforesaid kingdomes: and now will I speake somewhat of
the diuision of this Iland also into prouinces, as the Romanes seuered
it whiles they remained in these parts. Which being done, I hope that I
haue discharged whatsoeuer is promised in the title of this chapter.</p>

<p>The Romans therefore hauing obteined the possession of this Iland,
diuided the same at the last into fiue prouinces, as Vibius Sequester
<span class="leftnote">Britannia prima.</span>
saith. The first whereof was named Britannia prima, and conteined the
east part of England (as some doo gather) from the Trent vnto the Twede.
<span class="leftnote">Valentia.</span>
The second was called Valentia or Valentiana, and included the west
side, as they note it, from Lirpoole vnto Cokermouth. The third hight
<span class="rightnote">Britannia secunda.</span>
Britannia secunda, and was that portion of the Ile which laie
<span class="leftnote">Flauia Cæsariensis.</span>
southwards, betwéene the Trent and the Thames. The fourth was surnamed
Flauia Cæsariensis, and conteined all the countrie which remained
betweene Douer and the Sauerne, I meane by south of the Thames, and
wherevnto (in like sort) Cornewall and Wales were orderlie assigned.
<span class="page"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[Page 31]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Maxima Cæsariensis.</span>
The fift and last part was then named Maxima Cæsariensis, now Scotland,
the most barren of all the rest, and yet not vnsought out of the gréedie
Romanes, bicause of the great plentie of fish and foule, fine alabaster
and hard marble that are ingendred and to be had in the same, for
furniture of houshold and curious building, wherein they much delited.

¶ Thus haue</span> I brought the Catalog of the Princes of Britaine vnto an end, &amp;

fewer haue gone any thing néere the truth, through great ouersight
&amp; negligence. Their seuerall yéeres also doo appéere in my Chronologie insuing.
</p>

<h3><a name="d1-cap9" id="d1-cap9"></a>
<small>OF THE ANCIENT RELIGION VSED IN ALBION.</small><br />

CAP. IX.</h3>

<p>It is not to be doubted, but at the first, and so long as the posteritie
of Iaphet onelie reigned in this Iland, that the true knowledge and forme
<span class="leftnote">Samothes.</span>
of religion brought in by Samothes, and published with his lawes in the
second of his arriuall, was exercised among the Britans. And although
peraduenture in proces of time, either through curiositie, or negligence
(the onelie corruptors of true pietie and godlinesse) it might a little
decaie, yet when it was at the woorst, it farre excéeded the best of
that which afterward came in with Albion and his Chemminites, as may be
<span class="page"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[Page 34]</span>
gathered by view of the superstitious rites, which Cham and his
successours did plant in other countries, yet to be found in authors.</p>

<p>What other learning Magus the sonne of Samothes taught after his fathers
death, when he also came to the kingdome, beside this which concerned
the true honoring of God, I cannot easilie say, but that it should be
naturall philosophie, and astrologie (whereby his disciples gathered a
kind of foreknowledge of things to come) the verie vse of the word Magus
(or Magusæus) among the Persians dooth yéeld no vncerteine testimonie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Sarron.</span>
In like maner, it should seeme that Sarron sonne vnto the said Magus,
diligentlie followed the steps of his father, and thereto beside his
owne practise of teaching, opened schooles of learning in sundrie
places, both among the Celts and Britans, whereby such as were his
auditors, grew to be called Sarronides, notwithstanding, that as well
the Sarronides as the Magi, and Druiydes, were generallie called
<span class="leftnote">Samothei.<br />
Semnothei.</span>
Samothei, or Semnothei, of Samothes still among the Grecians, as
Aristotle in his De magia dooth confesse; and furthermore calling them
Galles, he addeth therevnto, that they first brought the knowledge of
letters and good learning vnto the Gréekes.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Druiyus.</span>
Druiyus the son of Sarron (as a scholer of his fathers owne teaching)
séemed to be exquisit in all things, that perteined vnto the diuine and
humane knowledge: and therefore I may safelie pronounce, that he
excelled not onlie in the skill of philosophie and the quadriuials, but
also in the true Theologie, whereby the right seruice of God was kept
and preserued in puritie. He wrote moreouer sundrie precepts and rules
of religious doctrine, which among the Celts were reserued verie
religiouslie, and had in great estimation of such as sought vnto them.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Corruptors of religion.</span>
How and in what order this prince left the state of religion, I meane
touching publike orders in administration of particular rites and
ceremonies, as yet I doo not read: howbeit this is most certeine, that
after he died, the puritie of his doctrine began somewhat to decaie. For
such is mans nature, that it will not suffer any good thing long to
remaine as it is left, but (either by addition or subtraction of this or
that, to or from the same) so to chop and change withall from time to
time, that in the end there is nothing of more difficultie, for such as
doo come after them, than to find out the puritie of the originall, and
restore the same againe vnto the former perfection.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Cæsar.</em></span>
In the beginning this Druiyus did preach vnto his hearers, that the
soule of man is immortall, that God is omnipotent, mercifull as a father
in shewing fauor vnto the godlie, and iust as an vpright iudge in
punishing the wicked; that the secrets of mans hart are not vnknowne,
and onelie knowne to him; and that as the world and all that is therein
had their beginning by him, at his owne will, so shall all things
likewise haue an end, when he shall see his time. He taught them also
<span class="leftnote"><em>Strabo. li. 4.</em><br />
<em>Socion. lib. success.</em></span>
with more facilitie, how to obserue the courses of the heauens and
motions of the planets by arithmeticall industrie, to find out the true
<span class="rightnote"><em>Cicero diuinat.</em> I.</span>
quantities of the celestiall bodies by geometricall demonstration, and
thereto the compasse of the earth, and hidden natures of things
contained in the same by philosophicall contemplation. But alas, this
integritie continued not long among his successors, for vnto the
immortalitie of the soule, they added, that after death it went into
another bodie, (of which translation Ouid saith;</p>

<p class="ind1">Morte carent animæ, sempérque priore relicta<br />
Sede, nouis domibus viuunt habitántque receptæ.)</p>

<p>The second or succedent, being alwaies either more noble, or more vile
than the former, as the partie deserued by his merits, whilest he liued
here vpon earth. And therefore it is said by Plato and other, that
Orpheus after his death had his soule thrust into the bodie of a swanne,
that of Agamemnon conueied into an egle, of Aiax into a lion, of Atlas
into a certeine wrestler, of Thersites into an ape, of Deiphobus into
Pythagoras, and Empedocles dieng a child, after sundrie changes into a
man, whereof he himselfe saith;</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[Page 35]</span></p>

<p class="ind1">Ipse ego námq; fui puer olim, deinde puella,<br />
Arbustum &amp; volucris, mutus quóq; in æquore piscis.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Plinius, lib. 16. cap. ultimo.</em></span>
For said they (of whom Pythagoras also had, and taught this errour) if
the soule apperteined at the first to a king, and he in this estate did
not leade his life worthie his calling, it should after his decease be
<span class="rightnote">Metempsuchôsis.</span>
shut vp in the bodie of a slaue, begger, cocke, owle, dog, ape, horsse,
asse, worme, or monster, there to remaine as in a place of purgation and
punishment, for a certeine period of time. Beside this, it should
peraduenture susteine often translation from one bodie vnto another,
according to the quantitie and qualitie of his dooings here on earth,
till it should finallie be purified, and restored againe to an other
humane bodie, wherein if it behaued it selfe more orderlie than at the
first: after the next death, it should be preferred, either to the bodie
of a king againe, or other great estate. And thus they made a perpetuall
circulation or reuolution of our soules, much like vnto the continuall
motion of the heauens, which neuer stand still, nor long yeeld one
representation and figure. For this cause also, as Diodorus saith, they
vsed to cast certeine letters into the fire, wherein the dead were
burned, to be deliuered vnto their deceased fréends, whereby they might
vnderstand of the estate of such as trauelled here on earth in their
purgations (as the Moscouits doo write vnto S. Nicholas to be a
speach-man for him that is buried, in whose hand they bind a letter, and
send him with a new paire of shooes on his feet into the graue) and to
the end that after their next death they should deale with them
accordinglie, and as their merits required. They brought in also the
worshipping of manie gods, and their seuerall euen to this daie
<span class="leftnote">Oke honored whereon mistle did grow, and so doo our sorcerers
thinking some spirits to deale about ye same, for hidden treasure.</span>
sacrifices: they honoured likewise the oke, whereon the mistle groweth,
and dailie deuised infinit other toies (for errour is neuer assured of
hir owne dooings) whereof neither Samothes, nor Sarron, Magus, nor
Druiyus did leaue them anie prescription.</p>

<p>These things are partlie touched by Cicero, Strabo, Plinie, Sotion,
Laertius, Theophrast, Aristotle, and partlie also by Cæsar, Mela, Val.
Max. lib. 2. and other authors of later time, who for the most part doo
confesse, that the cheefe schoole of the Druiydes was holden here in
Britaine, where that religion (saith Plinie) was so hotlie professed and
followed, "Vt dedisse Persis videri possit," lib. 30. cap. 1. and
whither the Druiydes also themselues, that dwelt among the Galles, would
often resort to come by the more skill, and sure vnderstanding of the
mysteries of that doctrine. And as the Galles receiued their religion
<span class="leftnote">Logike and Rhetorike out of Gallia.</span>]
from the Britons, so we likewise had from them some vse of Logike &amp;
Rhetorike, such as it was which our lawiers practised in their plees and
common causes. For although the Greeks were not vnknowne vnto vs, nor we
to them, euen from the verie comming of Brute, yet by reason of distance
betwéene our countries, we had no great familiaritie and common accesse
one vnto another, till the time of Gurguntius, after whose entrance
manie of that nation trauelled hither in more securitie, as diuers of
our countriemen did vnto them without all danger, to be offered vp in
sacrifice to their gods. That we had the maner of our plees also out of
France, Iuuenal is a witnesse, who saith;</p>

<p class="ind1">Gallia causidicos docuit facunda Britannos.</p>

<p>Howbeit as they taught vs Logike and Rhetorike, so we had also some
Sophistrie from them; but in the worst sense: for from France is all
kind of forgerie, corruption of maners, and craftie behauiour not so
soone as often transported into England. And albeit the Druiydes were
thus honored and of so great authoritie in Britaine, yet were there
great numbers of them also in the Iles of Wight, Anglesey, and the
Orchades, in which they held open schooles of their profession, aloofe
as it were from the resort of people, wherein they studied and learned
their songs by heart. Howbeit the cheefe college of all I say, remained
still in Albion, whither the Druiydes of other nations also (beside the
Galles) would of custome repaire, when soeuer anie controuersie among
them in matters of religion did happen to be mooued. At such times also
the rest were called out of the former Ilands, whereby it appeareth that
in such cases they had their synods and publike meetings, and therevnto
<span class="page"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[Page 36]</span>
it grew finallie into custome, and after that a prouerbe, euen in
variances falling out among the princes, great men, and common sorts of
people liuing in these weast parts of Europe, to yeeld to be tried by
Britaine and hir thrée Ilands, bicause they honoured hir préests (the
Druiydes) as the Athenians did their Areopagites.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Estimation of the Druiydes or Druiysh preests.</span>
Furthermore, in Britaine, and among the Galles, and to say the truth,
generallie in all places where the Druiysh religion was frequented, such
was the estimation of the préests of this profession, that there was
little or nothing doone without their skilfull aduise, no not in ciuil
causes, perteining to the regiment of the common-wealth and countrie.
They had the charge also of all sacrifices, publike and priuate, they
interpreted oracles, preached of religion, and were neuer without great
numbers of yoong men that heard them with diligence, as they taught from
time to time.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Immunitie of the cleargie greater vnder idolatrie
than vnder the gospell.</span>
Touching their persons also they were exempt from all temporall
seruices, impositions, tributes, and exercises of the wars: which
immunitie caused the greater companies of scholers to flocke vnto them
from all places, &amp; to learne their trades. Of these likewise, some
remained with them seuen, eight, ten, or twelue years, still learning
the secrets of those unwritten mysteries by heart, which were to be had
amongst them, and commonlie pronounced in verse. And this policie, as I
take it, they vsed onelie to preserue their religion from contempt,
whereinto it might easilie haue fallen, if any books thereof had
happened into the hands of the common sort. It helped also not a little
in the exercise of their memories, wherevnto bookes are vtter enimies,
insomuch as he that was skilfull in the Druiysh religion, would not let
readilie to rehearse manie hundreds of verses togither, and not to faile
in one tittle, in the whole processe of this his laborious repetition.
But as they dealt in this order for matters of their religion, so in
ciuill affairs, historicall treatises, and setting downe of lawes, they
vsed like order and letters almost with the Grecians. Whereby it is
easie to be séene, that they reteined this kind of writing from Druiyus
(the originall founder of their religion) and that this Iland hath not
béene void of letters and learned men, euen sith it was first inhabited.
I would ad some thing in particular also of their apparell, but sith the
dealing withall is nothing profitable to the reader, I passe it ouer,
signifieng neuerthelesse, that it was distinguished by sundrie deuises
from that of the common sort, and of such estimation among the people,
that whosoeuer ware the Druiysh weed, might walke where he would without
any harme or annoiance. This honour was giuen also vnto the préests in
Rome, insomuch that when Volusius was exiled by the Triumuirate, and saw
himselfe in such danger, as that he could not escape the hardest, he gat
the wéed of a preest upon his backe, and begged his almes therein, euen
in the high waies as he trauelled, and so escaped the danger and the
furie of his aduersaries: but to proceed with other things.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bardus.</span>
After the death of Druiyus, Bardus his sonne, and fift king of the
Celts, succéeded not onelie ouer the said kingdome, but also in his
fathers vertues, whereby it is verie likelie, that the winding and
wrapping vp of the said religion, after the afore remembred sort into
verse, was first deuised by him, for he was an excellent poet, and no
lesse indued with a singular skill in the practise and speculation of
musicke, of which two many suppose him to be the verie author and
<span class="leftnote"><em>Gen. 4. 21.</em></span>
beginner, although vniustlie, sith both poetrie and song were in vse
before the flood, as was also the harpe and pipe, which Iubal inuented,
and could neuer be performed without great skill in musicke. But to
procéed, as the cheefe estimation of the Druiydes remained in the end
among the Britons onelie, for their knowledge in religion, so did the
fame of the Bardes (which were so called of this Bardus for their
excellent skill in musicke, poetrie, and the heroicall kind of song,
which at the first conteined onelie the high mysteries and secret points
of their religion. There was little difference also betwéene them and
<span class="leftnote">The Bards degenerate.</span>
the Druiydes, till they so farre degenerated from their first
institution, that they became to be minstrels at feasts, droonken
meetings, and abhominable sacrifices of the idols: where they sang most
commonlie no diuinitie as before, but the puissant acts of valiant
princes, and fabulous narrations of the adulteries of the gods. Certes
in my time this fond vsage, and thereto the verie name of the Bardes,
are not yet extinguished among the Britons of Wales,
<span class="page"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[Page 37]</span>
where they call their poets and musicians Barthes, as they doo also in
Ireland: which Sulpitius also writing to Lucane remembreth, where he
saith that the word Bardus is meere Celtike, and signifieth a singer.
Howbeit the Romans iudging all nations beside themselues to be but rude
and barbarous, and thereto misliking vtterlie the rough musicke of the
Bardes, entred so farre into the contemptuous mockage of their melodie,
that they ascribed the word Bardus vnto their fooles and idiots, whereas
contrariwise the Scythians and such as dwell within the northweast part
of Europe, did vse the same word in verie honourable maner, calling
their best poets and heroicall singers, Singebardos; their couragious
singers and capiteins that delited in musicke, Albardos, Dagobardos,
Rodtbardos, &amp; one lame musician Lambard aboue all other, of whose
skilfull ditties Germanie is not vnfurnished, as I heare vnto this daie.
In Quizqueia or new Spaine, an Iland of the Indies, they call such men
Boitios, their rimes Arcitos, and in steed of harps they sing vnto
timbrels made of shels such sonnets and ditties as either perteine vnto
religion, prophane loue, commendation of ancestrie, and inflammation of
the mind vnto Mars, whereby there appeareth to be small difference
betwéene their Boitios and our Bardes. Finallie of our sort, Lucane in
his first booke writeth thus, among other like saiengs well toward the
latter end;<br /><span class="leftnote"><em>Lucani. li.</em> 1.</span></p>

<p class="ind1a">Vos quóq; qui fortes animas, bellóq; peremptas<br />
Laudibus in longum vates dimittitis æuum,<br />
Plurima securi fudistis carmina Bardi.<br />
Et vos barbaricos ritus, morémque sinistrum<br />
Sacrorum Druiydæ, positis recepistis ab armis.<br />
Solis nosse Deos, &amp; c&oelig;li numina vobis,<br />
Aut solis nescire datum: nemora alta remotis<br />

<p>Thus we sée as in a glasse the state of religion, for a time, after the
first inhabitation of this Iland: but how long it continued in such
soundnesse, as the originall authors left it, in good sooth I cannot
say, yet this is most certeine, that after a time, when Albion arriued
here, the religion earst imbraced fell into great decaie. For whereas
Iaphet &amp; Samothes with their children taught nothing else than such
doctrine as they had learned of Noah: Cham the great grandfather of this
our Albion, and his disciples vtterlie renouncing to follow their steps,
gaue their minds wholie to seduce and lead their hearers headlong vnto
all error. Whereby his posteritie not onelie corrupted this our Iland,
with most filthie trades and practises; but also all mankind, generallie
where they became, with vicious life, and most vngodlie conuersation.
<span class="leftnote">What doctrine
Cham and his disciples taught.</span>
For from Cham and his successours procéeded at the first all sorcerie,
witchcraft, and the execution of vnlawful lust, without respect of sex,
age, consanguinitie, or kind: as branches from an odious and abhominable
root, or streames deriued from a most filthie and horrible stinking
puddle. Howbeit, &amp; notwithstanding all these his manifold lewdnesses,
such was the follie of his Ægyptians (where he first reigned and taught)
that whilest he liued they alone had him in great estimation (whereas
other nations contemned and abhorred him for his wickednesse, calling
<span class="rightnote">Chemesenua.</span>
him Chemesenua, that is, the impudent, infamous and wicked Cham) and not
<span class="rightnote"><br />Chem Min.<br />
Cham made a god.</span>
onelie builded a citie vnto him which they called Chem Min, but also
after his death reputed him for a god, calling the highest of the seuen
<span class="page"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[Page 38]</span>
planets after his name, as they did the next beneath it after Osyris his
sonne, whom they likewise honored vnder the name of Iupiter.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Translation of mortall men into heauen how it began.</span>
Certes it was a custome begonne in Ægypt of old time, and generallie in
vse almost in euerie place in processe of time (when any of their famous
worthie princes died) to ascribe some forme or other of the stars vnto
his person, to the end his name might neuer weare out of memorie. And
this they called their translation in heauen, so that he which had any
starres or forme of starres dedicated vnto him, was properlie said to
haue a seat among the gods. A toie much like to the catalog of Romish
saints, (although the one was written in the celestiall or immateriall
orbes, the other in sheeps skins, and verie brickle paper) but yet so
estéemed, that euerie prince would oft hazard and attempt the vttermost
aduentures, thereby to win such fame in his life, that after his death
he might by merit haue such place in heauen, among the shining starres.
Howbeit, euerie of those that were called gods, could not obteine that
benefit, for then should there not haue béene stars enow in heauen to
haue serued all their turnes, wherfore another place was in time
imagined, where they reigned that were of a second calling, as the
<span class="leftnote"><em>Cyril, aduersus Iul. lib. 6. sect. 8.</em></span>
Semones who were gods by grace and fauour of the people. "Semones dici
voluerunt (saith Fulgentius In vocibus antiquis) quos c&oelig;lo nec dignos
ascriberent, ob meriti paupertatem; sicut Priapus Hyppo. Vortumnus, &amp;c.
nec terrenos eos deputare vellent per gratiæ venerationem," as also a
third place that is to say an earth, where those gods dwelled which were
noble men, officers, good gouernours and lawgiuers to the people, and
yet not thought worthie to be of the second or first companie, which was
a iollie diuision.</p>

<p>Thus we sée in generall maner, how idolatrie, honoring of the starres,
and brood of inferiour gods were hatched at the first, which follies in
processe of time came also into Britaine, as did the names of Saturne &amp;
Iupiter, &amp;c: as shall appeare hereafter. And here sith I haue alreadie
somewhat digressed from my matter, I will go yet a little farder, and
shew foorth the originall vse of the word Saturne, Iupiter, Hercules,
&amp;c: whereby your Honor shall sée a little more into the errours of the
Gentils, and not onelie that, but one point also <span class="leftnote">Which were
properlie called Saturni, Ioues, Iunones, and Hercules.</span> of the root of
all the confusion that is to be found among the ancient histories.
Certes it was vsed for a few yéeres after the partition of the earth
(which was made by Noah, in the 133. yeere after the floud) that the
beginners of such kingdoms as were then erected should be called
Saturni, whereby it came to passe that Nimbrote was the Saturne of
Babylon: Cham of Ægypt: and so foorth other of sundrie other countries.
Their eldest sonnes also that succeeded them, were called Ioues; and
their nephewes or sonnes sonnes, which reigned in the third place
Hercules, by which meanes it followed that euerie kingdome had a
Saturne, Iupiter and Hercules of hir owne, and not from anie other.</p>

<p>In like sort they had such another order among their daughters, whom
they married as yet commonlie vnto their brethren (God himselfe
permitting the same vnto them for a time) as before the floud, to the
end the earth might be thoroughlie replenished, and the sooner furnished
with inhabitants in euerie part therof. The sister therefore and wife of
<span class="leftnote">Isis, Io and Iuno all one.</span>
euerie Saturne was called Rhea, but of Iupiter, Iuno, Isis, or Io.
Beyond these also there was no latter Harold that would indeuour to
deriue the petigree of any prince, or potentate, but supposed his dutie
to be sufficientlie performed, when he had brought it orderlie vnto some
Saturne or other, wherat he might cease, and shut vp all his trauell.
They had likewise this opinion grounded amongst them, that heauen &amp;
earth were onlie parents vnto Saturne and Rhea, not knowing out of doubt,
<span class="leftnote">C&oelig;lum or C&oelig;lus.<br />
Ogyges.<br />
Sol.<br />
Pater deorum.</span>
what they themselues did meane, sith these denominations, Heauen,
Ogyges, the Sunne, Pater Deorum, and such like, were onelie ascribed
vnto Noah: as *Terra, (the Earth) Vesta, Aretia, the Moone, Mater
<span class="rightnote">* Tydea.<br />
Vesta.<br />
Terra.<br />
Luna.<br />
Aretia.<br />
Deorum mater.</span>
deorum, and other the like were vnto Tydea his wife. So that hereby we
sée, how Saturne is reputed in euerie nation for their oldest god, or
first prince, Iupiter for the next, and Hercules for the third. And
therefore sith these names were dispersed in the beginning ouer all, it
is no maruell that there is such confusion in ancient histories, and the
<span class="page"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[Page 39]</span>
dooings of one of them so mixed with those of another, that it is now
impossible to distinguish them in sunder. This haue I spoken, to the end
that all men may see what gods the Pagans honored, &amp; thereby what
religion the posteritie of Cham did bring ouer into Britaine. For vntill
their comming, it is not likelie that anie grosse idolatrie or
superstition did enter in among vs, as deifieng of mortall men, honoring
of the starres, and erection of huge images, beside sorcerie,
witchcraft, and such like, whereof the Chemminites are worthilie called
the autors. Neither were these errors anie thing amended, by the comming
<span class="leftnote">Fr&#333; whence Brute did learne his religion.</span>
in of Brute, who no doubt added such deuises vnto the same, as he and
his companie had learned before in Græcia, from whence also he brought
Helenus the sonne of Priamus, (a man of excéeding age) &amp; made him his
préest and bishop thorough out the new conquest, that he had atchieued
in Britaine.</p>

<p>After Brute, idolatrie and superstition still increased more and more
among vs, insomuch that beside the Druiysh and Bardike ceremonies, and
those also that came in with Albion and Brute himselfe: our countriemen
either brought hither from abroad, or dailie inuented at home new
religion and rites, whereby it came to passe that in the stead of the
onelie and immortall God (of whom Samothes and his posteritie did preach
<span class="leftnote">Dis or Samothes made a god.</span>
in times past) now they honored the said Samothes himselfe vnder the name
of Dis and Saturne: also Iupiter, Mars, Minerua, Mercurie, Apollo,
Diana; and finallie Hercules, vnto whome they dedicated the gates and
porches of their temples, entrances into their regions, cities, townes
and houses, with their limits and bounds (as the papists did the gates
of their cities and ports vnto Botulph &amp; Giles) bicause fortitude and
wisedome are the cheefe vpholders and bearers vp of common-wealths and
kingdoms, both which they ascribed to Hercules (forgetting God) and
diuers other idols whose names I now remember not. In lieu moreouer of
sheepe and oxen,
<span class="leftnote"><em>Mela. Diodorus, Strab. 4. Plin. Cæsar. 5.</em></span>
they offred mankind also vnto some of them, killing their offendors,
prisoners, and oft such strangers as came from farre vnto them, by
shutting vp great numbers of them togither in huge images made of
wicker, réed, haie, or other light matter: and then setting all on fire
togither, they not onelie consumed the miserable creatures to ashes
(sometimes adding other beasts vnto them) but also reputed it to be the
most acceptable sacrifice that could be made vnto their idols. From
whence they had this horrible custome, trulie I cannot tell, but that it
was common to most nations, not onlie to consume their strangers,
captiues, &amp;c; but also their owne children with fire, in such maner of
sacrifice: beside the text of the Bible, the prophane histories doo
generallie leaue it euident, as a thing either of custome or of
particular necessitie, of which later Virgil saith;</p>

<p class="ind1">Sanguine placastis ventos &amp; virgine cæsa, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As Silius dooth of the first, where he telleth of the vsuall maner of
the Carthaginenses, saieng after this maner;</p>

<p class="ind1">Vrna reducebat miserandos annua casus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But to procéed with our owne gods and idols, more pertinent to my
purpose than the rehersall of forreine demeanours: I find that huge
temples in like sort were builded vnto them, so that in the time of
Lucius, when the light of saluation began stronglie to shine in
<span class="leftnote"><em>Ptol. Lucensis.</em></span>
Britaine,thorough the preaching of the gospell, the christians
discouered 25. Flamines or idol-churches beside three Archflamines,
whose préests were then as our Archbishops are now, in that they had
superior charge of all the rest, the other being reputed as inferiours,
and subiect to their iurisdiction in cases of religion, and
superstitious ceremonies.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Monstrous proportions of idols.</span>
Of the quantities of their idols I speake not, sith it is inough to
saie, that they were monstrous, and that each nation contended which
should honour the greater blocks, and yet all pretending to haue the
iust heigth of the god or goddesse whom they did represent. Apollo
Capitolinus that stood at Rome, was thirtie cubits high at the least;
Tarentinus Iupiter of 40.; the idoll of the sonne in the Rhodes, of 70
(whose toe few men could fadam;) Tuscanus Apollo that stood in the
librarie of the temple of Augustus, of 50. foot; another made vnder Nero
of 110. foot; but one in France passed all, which Zenoduris made vnto
<span class="page"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[Page 40]</span>
Mercurie at Aruernum in ten years space, of 400. foot. Wherby it
appeareth, that as they were void of moderation in number of gods, so
without measure were they also in their proportions, and happie was he
which might haue the greatest idoll, and lay most cost thereon.</p>

<p>Hitherto yee haue heard of the time, wherein idolatrie reigned and
blinded the harts of such as dwelled in this Iland. Now let vs sée the
successe of the gospell, after the death and passion of Iesus Christ our
sauiour. And euen here would I begin with an allegation of
<span class="leftnote"><em>Theodoret.</em></span>
Theodoret, wherevpon some repose great assurance (conceiuing yet more
<span class="rightnote"><em>Sophronius.</em></span>
hope therein by the words of Sophronius) that Paule the Apostle should
preach the word of saluation here, after his deliuerie out of
captiuitie, which fell as I doo read in the 57. of Christ. But sith I
cannot verifie the same by the words of Theodoret, to be spoken more of
Paule than Peter, or the rest, I will passe ouer this coniecture (so far
as it is grounded vpon Theodoret) and deale with other authorities,
whereof we haue more certeintie. First of all therfore let vs see what
Fortunatus hath written of Pauls comming into Britaine, and afterward
what is to be found of other by-writers in other points of more
assurance. Certes for the presence of Paule I read thus much:</p>

<p class="ind1">Quid sacer ille simul Paulus tuba gentibus ampla,<br />
Per mare per terras Christi præconia fundens,<br />
Europam &amp; Asiam, Lybiam, sale dogmata complens,<br />
Arctos, meridies, hic plenus vesper &amp; ortus,<br />
Transit &amp; Oceanum, vel qua facit insula portum,<br />
Quásq; Britannus habet terras atque vltima Thule, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Iosephus.</span>
That one Iosephus preached here in England, in the time of the Apostles,
his sepulchre yet in Aualon, now called Glessenburg or Glastenburie, an
epitaph affixed therevnto is proofe sufficient. Howbeit, sith these
things are not of competent force to persuade all men, I will ad in few,
what I haue read elsewhere of his arriuall here. First of all therefore
you shall note that he came ouer into Britaine, about the 64. after
Christ, when the persecution began vnder Nero, at which time Philip and
diuers of the godlie being in France (whether he came with other
christians, after they had sowed the word of God in Scythia, by the
space of 9. yeares) seuered themselues in sunder, to make the better
shift for their owne safegard, and yet not otherwise than by their
flight, the gospell might haue due furtherance. Hereby then it came to
<span class="leftnote"><em>Philip. Freculphus. To. 2., lib. 2. cap. 4.</em><br />
<em>Nennius. Nicephorus lib. 2. cap. 40.</em><br />
<em>Isidorus lib. de vita &amp; obit. dict. patrum.</em><br />
<em>W. Malmes. de antiq. Glasconici monast.</em></span>
passe, that the said Philip vpon good deliberation did send Iosephus
ouer, and with him Simon Zelotes to preach vnto the Britons, and
minister the sacraments there according to the rites of the churches of
Asia and Greece, from whence they came not long before vnto the countrie
of the Galles. Which was saith Malmesburie 103. before Faganus and Dinaw
did set foorth the gospell amongst them. Of the c&#333;ming of Zelotes you
may read more in the second booke of Niceph. Cal. where he writeth
thereof in this maner: "Operæpretium etiam fuerit Simonem Cana Galileæ
ortum, qui propter flagrantem in magistrum suum ardorem, summámq;
euangelicæ rei per omnia curam Zelotes cognominatus est hîc referre,
accepit enim is c&oelig;litùs adueniente spiritu sancto, Aegyptium Cyrenem
&amp; Africam, deinde Mauritaniam &amp; Lybiam omnem euangelium deprædicans
percurrit, eandemque doctrinam etiam ad occidentalem Oceanum insulásque
Britannicas perfert." And this is the effect in a little roome, of that
which I haue read at large in sundrie writers, beside these two here
alledged, although it may well be gathered that diuers Britains were
conuerted to the faith, before this sixtie foure of Christ. Howbeit,
whereas some write that they liued, and dwelled in Britaine, it cannot
as yet take any absolute hold in my iudgement, but rather that they were
baptised and remained, either in Rome, or else-where. And of this sort I
suppose
<span class="leftnote">Claudia Rufina a British ladie.</span>
Claudia Rufina the wife of Pudens to be one, who was a British ladie
indeed, and not onelie excellentlie séene in the Gréeke and Latine
toongs, but also with hir husband highlie commended by S. Paule, as one
<span class="rightnote"><em>1. Tim. 4.</em></span>
hauing had conuersation and conference with them at Rome, from whence he
did write his second epistle vnto Timothie, as I read. Of this ladie
moreouer Martial speaketh, in reioising that his poesies were read also
<span class="page"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[Page 41]</span>
in Britaine, and onelie by hir meanes, who vsed to cull out the finest &amp;
honestest of his epigrams and send them to hir fréends for tokens,
saieng after this maner, as himselfe dooth set it downe:</p>

<p class="ind1">Dicitur &amp; nostros cantare Britannia versus.</p>

<p>Furthermore making mention of hir and hir issue, he addeth these words:</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Li. 11. Epig. 54.</em></span></p>

<p class="ind1a">Claudia c&oelig;ruleis cùm sit Rufina Britannis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edita, cur Latiæ pectora plebis habet?<br />
Quale decus formæ? Romanam credere matres<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quot sperat, generos, quótque puella nurus.<br />
Sic placeat superis, vt coniuge gaudeat vno,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Et semper natis gaudeat illa tribus.</p>

<p>The names of hir thrée children were Prudentiana, Praxedes, both
virgins, and Nouatus, who after the death of Pudens their father (which
befell him in Cappadocia) dwelled with their mother in Vmbria, where
they ceased not from time to time to minister vnto the saints. But to
leaue this impertinent discourse, and proceed with my purpose.</p>

<p>I find in the Chronicles of Burton (vnder the yeare of Grace 141. and
time of Hadrian the emperour) that nine scholers or clerkes of Grantha
or Granta (now Cambridge) were baptised in Britaine, and became
preachers of the gospell there, but whether Taurinus bishop or elder
ouer the congregation at Yorke (who as Vincentius saith, was executed
<span class="leftnote"><em>Lib. 10. cap. 17.</em><br />
Taurinus.</span>
about this time for his faith) were one of them or not, as yet I do not
certeinlie find; but rather the contrarie, which is that he was no
Britaine at all, but Episcopus Ebroicensis, for which such as perceiue
not the easie corruption of the word, may soone write Eboracensis as
certeinlie mine author out of whom I alledge this authoritie hath done
before me. For Vincentius saith flat otherwise, and therefore the
Chronologie if it speake of anie Taurinus bishop of Yorke is to be
reformed in that behalfe. Diuers other also imbraced the religion of
Christ verie zealouslie before these men. Howbeit, all this
notwithstanding, the glad tidings of the gospell had neuer free and open
passage here, vntill the time of Lucius, in which the verie enimies of
the word became the apparent meanes (contrarie to their owne minds) to
haue it set foorth amongst vs. For when Antoninus the emperour had giuen
out a decrée, that the Druiysh religion should euerie where be
abolished, Lucius the king (whose surname is now perished) tooke aduise
of his councell what was best to be doone, &amp; wrote in this behalfe. And
this did Lucius, bicause he knew it *impossible for man to liue long
<span class="rightnote">* This is contrarie to the common talke of our
Atheists who say, Let vs liue here in wealth, credit and
authoritie vpon earth, and let God take heauen and his
religion to himselfe to doo withall what he listeth.</span>
without any religion at all: finallie finding his Nobilitie &amp; subiects
vtter enemies to the Romane deuoti&#333; (for that they made so many gods
as they listed, &amp; some to haue the regiment euen of their dirt &amp; dung)
and thervnto being pricked forwards by such christians as were
conuersant about him, to choose the seruice of the true God that liueth
for euer, rather than the slauish seruitude of any pagan idoll: he
fullie resolued with himselfe in the end, to receiue and imbrace the
gospell of Christ. He sent also two of his best learned and greatest
<span class="leftnote">Lucius openeth his ears to good counsell,
as one desirous to serue God &amp; not prefer the world.</span>
philosophers to Rome, vnto Eleutherus then bishop there in the 177. of
Christ, not to promise any subiection to his sea, which then was not
required, but to say with such as were pricked in mind, Acts. 2. verse.
37. "Quid faciemus viri fratres?" I meane that they were sent to be
perfectlie instructed, and with farther commission, to make earnest
request vnto him and the congregation there, that a competent number of
preachers might be sent ouer from thence, by whose diligent aduise and
trauell, the foundation of the gospell might surelie be laid ouer all
the portion of the Ile, which conteined his kingdome, according to his
mind.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">The purpose of Lucius opened vnto the
congregation at Rome by Eleutherus.</span>
When Eleutherus vnderstood these things, he reioiced not a little for
the great goodnesse, which the Lord had shewed vpon this our Ile and
countrie. Afterwards calling the brethren togither, they agréed to
ordeine, euen those two for bishops, whom Lucius as you haue heard, had
<span class="page"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[Page 42]</span>
directed ouer vnto them. Finallie after they had thoroughlie catechized
them, making generall praier vnto God and earnest supplication for the
good successe of these men, they sent them home againe with no small
charge, that they should be diligent in their function, and carefull
ouer the flocke committed to their custodie.</p>

<p>The first of these was called Eluanus Aualonius, a man borne in the Ile
of Aualon, and brought up there vnder those godlie pastours and their
disciples, whom Philip sent ouer at the first for the conuersion of the
Britons. The other hight Medguinus, and was thereto surnamed Belga,
bicause he was of the towne of Welles, which then was called Belga. This
man was trained vp also in one schoole with Eluanus, both of them being
ornaments to their horie ages, and men of such grauitie and godlinesse,
that Eleutherus supposed none more worthie to support this charge, than
they: after whose comming home also, it was not long yer Lucius and all
<span class="leftnote">A zealous prince maketh feruent subiects.</span>
his houshold with diuers of the Nobilitie were baptised, beside infinit
numbers of the common people, which dailie resorted vnto them, and
voluntarilie renounced all their idolatrie and paganisme.</p>

<p>In the meane time, Eleutherus vnderstanding the successe of these
learned doctours, and supposing with himselfe, that they two onlie could
not suffice to support so great a charge as should concerne the
conuersion of the whole Iland; he directed ouer vnto them in the yeare
<span class="rightnote">Faganus.<br />
Dinauus.<br />
Aaron.</span>
insuing Faganus, Dinaw (or Dinauus) Aaron, and diuerse other godlie
preachers, as fellow-labourers to trauell with them in the vineyard of
<span class="leftnote"><em>Radulphus de la noir aliàs Niger.</em></span>
the Lord. These men therefore after their comming hither, consulted with
the other, and foorthwith <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'who lieconsented'">wholie consented</ins> to make a diuision of this
<span class="leftnote"><br />3. Cheefe Bishops in Britaine.</span>
Iland amongst themselues, appointing what parcell each preacher should
take, that with the more profit and ease of the people, and somewhat
lesse trauell also for themselues, the doctrine of the Gospell might be
preached and receiued. In this distribution, they ordeined that there
<span class="leftnote">Theonus.<br />
Theodosius.<br />
London.<br />
Yorke.<br />
Caerlheon.</span>
should be one congregation at London, where they placed Theonus as
chéefe elder and bishop, for that present time, worthilie called
Theonus. 1. for there was another of that name who fled into Wales with
Thadiocus of Yorke, at the first comming of the Saxons; and also
Guthelmus, who went (as I read) into Armorica, there to craue aid
against the Scots and Vandals that plagued this Ile, from the Twede vnto
the Humber. After this Theonus also Eluanus succéeded, who conuerted
manie of the Druiydes, and builded the first librarie neere vnto the
bishops palace. The said Lucius also placed another at Yorke, whither
they appointed Theodosius: and the third at Caerlheon vpon the riuer
Vske, builded sometimes by Belinus, and called Glamorgantia, but now
Chester (in which three cities there had before time beene thrée
Archflamines erected vnto Apollo, Mars, and Minerua, but now raced to
the ground, and three other churches builded in their steeds by Lucius)
to the end that the countries round about might haue indifferent accesse
vnto those places, and therewithall vnderstand for certeintie, whither
to resort for resolution, if after their conuersion they should happen
to doubt of any thing. In like sort also the rest of the idoll-temples
standing in other places were either ouerthrowne, or conuerted into
churches for christian congregations to assemble in, as our writers doo
remember. In the report whereof giue me leaue gentle reader, of London
my natiue citie to speake a little: for although it may and dooth seeme
impertinent to my purpose, yet it shall not be much, and therefore I
will soone make an end. There is a controuersie moued among our
historiographers, whether the church that Lucius builded at London stood
at Westminster, or in Cornehill. For there is some cause, why the
metropolitane church should be thought to stand where S. Peters now
doth, by the space of 400. &amp; od yéeres before it was remoued to
Canturburie by Austine the monke, if a man should leane to one side
without anie conference of the asseuerations of the other. But herin (as
I take it) there lurketh some scruple, for beside that S. Peters church
stood in the east end of the citie, and that of Apollo in the west, the
word Cornehill (a denomination giuen of late to speake of to one street)
may easilie be mistaken for Thorney. For as the word Thorney proceedeth
from the Saxons, who called the west end of the citie by that name,
where Westminster now standeth, bicause of the wildnesse and bushinesse
of the soile; so I doo not read of anie stréete in London
<span class="page"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[Page 43]</span>
called Cornehill before the conquest of the Normans. Wherfore I hold
with them, which make Westminster to be the place where Lucius builded
his church vpon the ruines of that Flamine 264. yeeres, as Malmesburie
saith, before the comming of the Saxons, and 411. before the arriuall of
Augustine. Read also his appendix in lib. 4. Pontif. where he noteth the
time of the Saxons, in the 449. of Grace, and of Augustine in the 596.
of Christ; which is a manifest accompt, though some copies haue 499. for
the one, but not without manifest corruption and error.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Britaine the first prouince that receiued
the Gospell generallie.</span>
Thus became Britaine the first prouince that generallie receiued the
faith, and where the gospell was freelie preached without inhibition of
hir prince. Howbeit, although that Lucius and his princes and great
numbers of his people imbraced the word with gréedinesse, yet was not
the successe thereof either so vniuersall, that all men beleeued at the
first; the securitie so great, as that no persecution was to be feared
from the Romane empire after his decease; or the procéeding of the king
so seuere, as that he inforced any man by publike authoritie to forsake
and relinquish his paganisme: but onelie this fréedome was enioied, that
who so would become a christian in his time, might without feare of his
lawes professe the Gospell, in whose testimonie, if néed had béene, I
doubt not to affirme, but that he would haue shed also his bloud, as did
<span class="leftnote">Emerita neece vnto Lucius.</span>
his neece Emerita, who being constant aboue the common sort of women,
refused not after his decease by fire, to yeeld hir selfe to death, as a
swéet smelling sacrifice in the nostrels of the Lord, beyond the sea in
France.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Lucius sendeth againe to Rome.</span>
The faith of Christ being thus planted in this Iland in the 177. after
Christ, and Faganus and Dinaw with the rest sent ouer from Rome, in the
178. as you haue heard: it came to passe in the third yeare of the
Gospell receiued, that Lucius did send againe to Eleutherus the bishop,
requiring that he might haue some breefe epitome of the order of
discipline then vsed in the church. For he well considered, that as it
auaileth litle to plant a costlie vineyard, except it afterward be
cherished, kept in good order, and such things as annoie, dailie
remooued from the same: so after baptisme and entrance into religion, it
profiteth little to beare the name of christians, except we doo walke in
<span class="leftnote"><em>Ro. 3. ver. 1.</em></span>
the spirit, and haue such things as offend apparentlie, corrected by
seuere discipline. For otherwise it will come to passe, that the wéedes
of vice, and vicious liuing, will so quicklie abound in vs, that they
will in the end choke vp the good séed sowne in our minds, and either
inforce vs to returne vnto our former wickednesse with déeper securitie
than before, or else to become meere Atheists, which is a great deale
woorse.</p>

<p>For this cause therefore did Lucius send to Rome, the second time, for a
copie of such politike orders as were then vsed there, in their regiment
<span class="leftnote">The wisedome of Eleutherus.</span>
of the church. But Eleutherus considering with himselfe, how that all
nations are not of like condition, and therefore those constitutions
that are beneficiall to one, may now and then be preiudiciall to
another: and séeing also that beside the word no rites and orders can
long continue, or be so perfect in all points, but that as time serueth,
they will require alteration: he thought it best not to laie any more
vpon the necks of the new conuerts of Britaine as yet, than Christ and
his apostles had alreadie set downe vnto all men. In returning therefore
his messengers, he sent letters by them vnto Lucius and his Nobilitie,
dated in the consulships of Commodus and Vespronius, wherein he told
them that Christ had left sufficient order in the Scriptures for the
gouernment of his church alreadie in his word, and not for that onlie,
but also for the regiment of his whole *kingdome, if he would submit
himselfe, to yéeld and follow that rule. The epistle it selfe is partlie
<span class="rightnote">* Though most princes canot heare on that side.</span>
extant, and partlie perished, yet such as it is, and as I haue
faithfullie translated it out of sundrie verie ancient copies, I doo
deliuer it here, to the end I will not defraud the reader of anie thing
that may turne to the glorie of God, and his commoditie, in the historie
of our nation.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Epistle of Eleutherus vnto Lucius.</span>
"You require of vs the Romane ordinances, and thereto the statutes of
the emperours to be sent ouer vnto you, and which you desire to practise
and put in vre within your realme and kingdome. The Romane lawes and
those of emperours we may eftsoones reprooue, but those of God can neuer
be found fault withall. You haue receiued of late through Gods mercie in
<span class="page"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[Page 44]</span>
the realme of Britaine the law and faith of Christ, you haue with you
both volumes of the scriptures: out of them therefore by Gods grace, and
the councell of your realme take you a law, and by that law through Gods
sufferance rule your kingdome, for you are Gods vicar in your owne
<span class="leftnote"><em>Psal. 24.</em></span>
realme, as the roiall prophet saith; The earth is the Lords and all that
is therein, the compasse of the world, and they that dwell therein.
<span class="rightnote"><em>Psal. 45.</em></span>
Againe, Thou hast loued truth and hated iniquitie, wherefore God, euen
thy God hath annointed thee with oile of gladnesse aboue thy fellowes.
<span class="leftnote"><em>Psal. 71.</em></span>
And againe, according to the saieng of the same prophet; Oh God giue thy
iudgement vnto the king, &amp; thy iustice vnto the kings sonne. The kings
sons are the christian people &amp; flocke of the realme, which are vnder
your gouernance, and liue &amp; continue in peace within your kingdome. *
<span class="rightnote">* Here wanteth.</span>
The gospell saith; As the hen gathereth hir chickens vnder hir wings, so
dooth the king his people. Such as dwell in the kingdome of Britaine are
yours, whom if they be diuided, you ought to gather into concord and
vnitie, to call them to the faith and law of Christ, and to his sacred
church: to chearish and mainteine, to rule also and gouerne them,
defending each of them from such as would doo them wrong, and keeping
them from the malice of such as be their enimies. *Wo vnto the nation
whose king is a child, and whose princes rise vp earlie to banket and
féed, which is spoken not of a prince that is within age, but of a
prince that is become a child, through follie, sinne &amp; vnstedfastnesse,
of whom the prophet saith; The bloudthirstie and deceitfull men shall
not liue foorth halfe their daies. *By féeding I vnderstand gluttonie;
<span class="leftnote"><em>Psal. 55.</em></span>
by gluttonie, lust; &amp; by lust all wickednesse &amp; sinne, according to the
saieng of Salomon the king; Wisedome entreth not into a wicked mind, nor
dwelleth with a man that is subiect vnto sinne. A king hath his name of
ruling, and not of the possession of his realme. You shalbe a king
whilest you rule well, but if you doo otherwise, the name of a king
shall not remaine with you, but you shall vtterlie forgo it, which God
forbid. The almightie God grant you so to rule the kingdome of Britaine,
that you may reigne with him for euer, whose vicar (or vicegerent) you
are within your aforesaid kingdome. Who with the Sonne and the
Holie-ghost, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Hitherto out of the epistle that Eleutherus sent vnto Lucius, wherein
manie pretie obseruations are to be collected, if time and place would
serue to stand vpon them. After these daies also the number of such as
were ordeined to saluation, increased dailie more and more, whereby (as
in other places of the world) the word of God had good successe in
Britaine, in time of peace; and in heat of persecution, there were no
<span class="leftnote">Albane.<br />
Amphibalus.<br />
Iulius.<br />
Aaron.</span>
small number of martyrs that suffered for the same, of which Albane,
Amphibalus, Iulius, and Aaron, are reputed to be the chiefe, bicause of
their noble parentage, which is a great matter in the sight of worldlie
men.</p>

<p>There are which affirme our Lucius to renounce his kingdome, and
afterward to become first a bishop, then a preacher of the gospell, and
afterward a pope: but to the end such as hold this opinion may once
vnderstand the botome of their errors, I will set downe the matter at
large, whereby they shall sée (if they list to looke) how far they haue
béene deceiued.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Chlorus had three sons, &amp; a daughter by Helena.</span>
I find that Chlorus had issue by his second wife, two sonnes, Dalmatius
(who had a sonne called also Dalmatius and slaine by the souldiors.)
Constantius father to Gallus, and Iulian the apostata; besides foure
other whose names as yet I find not. But being at the first matched with
Helena, and before she was put from him by the roiall power of
Dioclesian, he had by hir three sonnes (beside one daughter named
Emerita) of which the name of the first is perished, the second was
called Lucius, &amp; the third Constantine, that afterward was emperour of
Rome, by election of the armies in Britaine. Now it happened that
Lucius, whome the French call Lucion, by means of a quarell growne
betwéene him and his elder brother, did kill his said brother, either by
a fraie or by some other meanes, wherevpon his father exiled him out of
Britaine, and appointed him from thenceforth to remaine in Aquitane in
France. This Lucion brought thus into worldlie sorow, had now good
leasure to meditate vpon heauen, who before in his prosperitie had
<span class="page"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[Page 45]</span>
peraduenture neuer regard of hell. Finallie he fell so far into the
consideration of his estate, that at the last he renounced his paganisme,
<span class="leftnote">Lucion becommeth a christian.<br />
Lucion a bishop.</span>
and first became a christian, then an elder, and last of all a bishop in
the church of Christ. He erected also a place of praier wherein to serue
the liuing God, which after sundrie alterations came in processe of time
to be an Abbaie, and is still called euen to our time after Lucion or
Lucius: the first founder therof, and the originall beginner of anie
such house in those parts.</p>

<p>In this also he and diuers other of his freends continued their times,
in great contemplation and praier, and from hence were translated as
occasion serued, vnto sundrie ecclesiasticall promotions in the time of
Constant. his brother. So that euen by this short narration it is now
easie to sée, that Lucius the king, and Lucius or Lucion the sonne of
<span class="leftnote"><em>Hermannus Schedelius. Bruschius cap. 3.</em></span>
Chlorus, were distinct persons. Herevnto Hermannus Schedelius addeth
also how he went into Rhetia with Emerita his sister, and néere vnto the
citie Augusta conuerted the Curienses vnto the faith of Christ, and
there likewise (being put to death in Castro Martis) lieth buried in the
same towne, where his feast is holden vpon the third daie of December,
as may readilie be confirmed, whereas the bones of our Lucius were to be
séene at Glocester. That Schedelius erreth not herein also, the ancient
monuments of the said Abbaie, whereof he was the originall beginner, as
I said, doo yeeld sufficient testimonie, beside an hymne made in his
commendation, intituled Gaude Lucionum, &amp;c. But for more of this you may
<span class="leftnote"><em>Festum Lucionis. Iohn Bouchet.</em></span>
resort vnto Bouchet in his first booke, and fift chapter of the Annales
of Aquitane, who neuertheles maketh the king of Britaine grandfather to
this Lucion. The said Schedelius furthermore setteth downe, that his
<span class="rightnote">Emerita martyred in Rhetia.</span>
sister was martyred in Trinecastell, néere vnto the place where the said
Lucion dwelled, whereby it appéereth in like sort, that she was not
sister to Lucius king of Britaine, of which prince Alexander Neccham in
his most excellent treatise De sapientia diuina, setteth downe this
Distichon:</p>

<p class="ind1">Prima Britannorum fidei lux Lucius esse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fertur, qui rexit m&oelig;nia Brute tua.</p>

<p>Neither could Lucion or Lucius be fellow and of kinred vnto Paule the
apostle, as Auentine inferreth, except he meane it of some other Lucius,
as of one whome he nameth Cyrinensis. But then will not the historie
agree with the conuersion of the Rhetians and Vindelicians, whereof
Schedelius and other doo make mention. But as each riuer the farder it
runneth from the head, the more it is increased by small riuelets, and
corrupted with filthie puddels, and stinking gutters, that descend into
<span class="leftnote">Heresie and monastical life brought into
Britaine at one time by <em>Pelagius</em>.</span>
the same: so the puritie of the gospell, preached here in Britaine, in
processe of time became first of all to be corrupted with a new order of
religion, and most execrable heresie, both of them being brought in at
once by Pelagius, of Wales, who hauing trauelled through France, Italie,
Aegypt, Syria, &amp; the easterlie regions of the world, was there at the
last made an elder or bishop, by some of the monkes, vnto whose
profession he had not long before wholie addicted himselfe. Finallie
returning home againe with an augmentation of fame and countenance of
greater holinesse than he bare out of the land with him, he did not
onelie erect an house of his owne order at Bangor in Wales, vpon the
<span class="leftnote">Bangor.</span>
riuer Dee, but also sowed the pestiferous séed of his hereticall
prauities ouer all this Iland, whereby he seduced great numbers of
Britons, teaching them to preferre their owne merits, before the free
mercie of God, in Jesus Christ his sonne. By this means therefore he
brought assurance of saluation into question, and taught all such as had
a diligent respect vnto their workes to be doubtfull of the same,
whereas to such as regard this latter, there can be no quietnesse of
mind, but alwaies an vnstedfast opinion of themselues, whereby they
cannot discerne, neither by prosperitie nor aduersitie of this life,
whether they be worthie loue or hatred. Neuertheles it behooueth the
godlie to repose their hope in that grace which is freelie granted
through Jesu Christ, and to flee vnto the mercies of God which are
offered vnto vs in with and by his son, to the end that we may at the
last find the testimonie of his spirit working with ours, that we are
his chosen children, whereby commeth peace of conscience to such as doo
beléeue.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[Page 46]</span></p>

<p>Thus we sée how new deuises or orders of religion and heresie came in
together. I could shew also what Comets, and strange signes appeared in
Britaine, much about the same time, the like of which with diuers other
haue beene perceiued also from time to time, sithence the death of
Pelagius, at the entrance of anie new kind of religion into this Ile of
Britaine. But I passe them ouer, onelie for that I would not seeme in my
tractation of antiquities, to trouble my reader with the rehersall of
anie new inconueniences.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Anachorites.<br />
Heremites.<br />
Cyrillines.<br />
Benedictines.</span>
To procéed therefore with my purpose, after these, there followed in
like sort sundrie other kinds of monasticall life, as Anachorites,
Heremits, Cyrilline and Benedictine monkes, albeit that the heremeticall
profession was onelie allowed of in Britaine, vntill the comming of
Augustine the monke, who brought in the Benedictine sect, framed after
the order of the house which Benedict surnamed Nursinus did first erect
in Monte Cassino, about the 524. of Christ, &amp; was finallie so well liked
of all men, that we had few or (as I suppose) no blacke monkes in
England that were not of his order. In processe of time how Benedict
Biscop also our countrieman restored the said Benedictine profession
greatlie decaied in England, our histories are verie plentifull, which
Biscop went off into Italie, and at one time for a speciall confirmation
of his two monasteries which he had builded at other mens costs vnto
<span class="leftnote">Monkes and Heremites onelie allowed of in Britaine.</span>
Paule and Peter vpon the bankes of the Were, as Beda dooth remember. So
fast also did these and other like humane deuises prosper after his
time, that at their suppression in England and Wales onelie, there were
found 440. religious houses at the least, of which 373. might dispend
200. li. by the yéere at the least, as appeareth by the record of their
suppression, which also noteth the totall summe of their reuenues to
amount vnto 32000. pounds, their moueables 100000. li. and the number of
<span class="leftnote">The number of religious houses in England at their dissolution.</span>
religious men conteined in the same, to be 10000. which would make a
pretie armie, wherevnto if you adde those 45. of late standing in
Scotland, you shall soone see what numbers of these dens of spirituall
robbers were mainteined here in Britaine. What number of saincts also
haue béene hatched in them I could easilie remember, and beside those
160. which Capgraue setteth downe, &amp; other likewise remembred in the
golden Legend, and Legendarie of Excester, I might bring a rable out of
Scotland able to furnish vp a calendar, though the yere were twise as
long.</p>

<p>As touching Pelagius the first heretike that euer was bred in this
realme (notablie knowne) and parent of Monachisme, it is certeine, that
before his corruption and fall, he was taken for a man of singular
learning, deepe iudgement, and such a one, as vpon whome for his great
gifts in teaching and strictnesse of life, no small péece of the hope
and expectation of the people did depend. But what is wisedome of the
flesh, without the feare and true knowledge of God? and what is learning
except it be handmaid to veritie and sound iudgement? Wherefore euen of
<span class="leftnote">Roger Bakon his saieng of the preachers of his
time who were the best lawyers and the worst Diuines.</span>
this man, we may see it verified, that one Roger Bakon pronounced long
after of the corruption of his time, when all things were measured by
wit and worldlie policie, rather than by the scriptures or guidance of
the spirit; Better it is saith he, to heare a rude and simple idiot
preach the truth, without apparance of skill and learned eloquence, than
a profound clearke to set foorth error, with great shew of learning, and
boast of filed vtterance. Gerson in like sort hath said fullie asmuch.
These follies of Pelagius were blased abroad about the 400. of Christ,
and from thencefoorth how his number of monkes increased on the one
side, and his doctrine on the other, there is almost no reader that is
vnskilfull and ignorant.</p>

<p>This also is certeine, that within the space of 200. yeares and odde,
<span class="leftnote">More than 2100 monkes in the College or Abbaie of
Bangor in whose territories the parish of Ouerton standeth.</span>
there were manie more than 2100. monkes gathered togither in his house,
whose trades notwithstanding the errors or their founder, (who taught
such an estimation of merits and bodilie exercise (as Paule calleth it)
that therby he sought not onlie to impugne, but also preuent grace,
which was in deed the originall occasion of the erection of his house)
were yet farre better and more godlie than all those religious orders,
that were inuented of later time, wherein the professours liued to
themselues, their wombs and the licentious fruition of those parts, that
are beneath the bellie. For these laboured continuallie for their owne
liuings, at vacant times from praier (as did Serapions monkes, which
<span class="rightnote"><em>Niceph. lib. II. cap. 34.</em></span>
were 10000. ouer whome he himselfe was Abbat) and likewise for the
<span class="page"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[Page 47]</span>
better maintenance of such learned men as were their appointed
preachers. Their liues also were correspondent to their doctrine, so
that herein onelie they seemed intollerable, in that they had confidence
in their déeds, and no warrant out of the word for their succor &amp;
defense, but were such a plant as the heauenlie father had not planted,
and therefore no maruell, though afterward they were raised by the
roots.</p>

<p>But as Pelagius and his adherents had a time to infect the church of
Christ in Britaine, so the liuing God hath had a season also to purge
and cleanse the same, though not by a full reformation of doctrine,
<span class="leftnote">Germanus, Lupus, Palladius, Patricius.</span>
sith Germanus, Lupus, Palladius, Patricius, and such like leaning for
the most part vnto the monasticall trades, did not so much condemne the
generall errors of Pelagius one waie, as mainteine the same, or as euill
opinions another. For as Patricke séemed to like well of the honoring of
the dead, so Germanus being in Britaine repaired an old chapell to
<span class="leftnote"><em>Seuerus Sulpitius in vita Patricij.</em></span>
S. Albane, wherein Lupus also praied, as Palladius vpheld the
strictnesse of life, in monasticall profession to the vttermost of his
power. Wherefore God wrought this purgation of his house at the first,
rather by taking awaie the wicked and pompous schoolemaisters of errour
out of this life: hoping that by such meanes, his people would haue
giuen eare to the godlie that remained. But in processe of time, when
this his mercifull dealing was forgotten and our countriemen returned to
their former disorders, he brought in the Saxons, who left no idoll
vnhonored, no not their filthie Priapus, vnto whom the women builded
temples, and made a beastlie image (Cum pene intenso, and as if he had
beene circumcised) whome they called Ithypallus, Verpus, and as Goropius
Atvatic. pag. 26. addeth, Ters: calling vpon him in maner at euerie
word, yea at the verie fall of a knife out of their hands, and not
counted anie shame vnto the most ancient and sober matrone of them all.
Howbeit when this procéeding of the Lord could also take no place, and
the shéepe of his pasture would receiue no wholesome fodder, it pleased
his maiestie, to let them run on headlong from one iniquitie to another,
in somuch that after the doctrine of Pelagius, it receiued that of Rome
<span class="leftnote">Augustine the monke.</span>]
also, brought in by Augustine and his monkes, whereby it was to be
seene, how they fell from the truth into heresie, and from one heresie
still into another, till at the last they were drowned altogither in the
pits of error digged vp by Antichrist, wels in deed that hold no water,
which notwithstanding to their followers séemed to be most sound
doctrine, and cisterns of liuing water to such as imbraced the same.</p>
<p>
This Augustine, after his arriuall,
<span class="leftnote">Augustine.</span>
conuerted the Saxons in déed from
paganisme, but as the prouerbe saith, bringing them out of Gods blessing
into the warme sunne, he also imbued them with no lesse hurtfull
superstition, than they did know before: for beside the onelie name of
Christ, and externall contempt of their pristinate idolatrie, he taught
them nothing at all, but rather (I saie) made an exchange from grosse to
subtill treacherie, from open to secret idolatrie, &amp; from the name of
pagans, to the bare title of christians, thinking this sufficient for
their soules health, and the stablishment of his monachisme, of which
kind of profession, the holie scriptures of God can in no wise like or
allow. But what cared he? sith he got the great fish for which he did
cast his hooke, and so great was the fish that he caught in déed, that
within the space of 1000. yeares, and lesse, it deuoured the fourth part
&amp; more of the best soile of the Iland, which was wholie bestowed vpon
his monkes, &amp; other religious broodes that were hatched since his time,
as may hereafter appéere in the booke following, where I intreate of
cities, townes, &amp;c. In the meane season what successe his monkes had
<span class="leftnote">Monks of Canturburie plagued.</span>
at Canturburie, how oft they were spoiled by enimies, their houses
burned by casualtie, and brethren consumed with pestilence, I refer me
to Gotcellius, Houeden, Geruase, and the rest of their owne
historiographers. And so sore did the pestilence rage among them in the
time of Celnothus (in whose daies the preests, clerks and monkes sang
their seruice togither in the quire, that (of I wote not how manie)
there remained onelie fiue aliue, which was a notable token of the furie
and wrath of God conceiued and executed against that malignant
generation. It came also to passe at the last that men vsed to praie for
helpe at the said Augustines tumbe (although afterward Thomas Becket a
newer saint did not a little deface his glorie) among which king
<span class="page"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[Page 48]</span>
Athelstane was one,whome Elnothus the abbat staied so long in the place,
when he came thither to praie, that his soldiours waiting for his
comming, and supposing the monkes to haue murdered him, began to giue an
assault and set fire vpon the house.</p>
<p>
Whilest these things were thus in hand, in the south part of Albion, the
<span class="leftnote">Meates.<br />
Pictes.<br />
Caledoniens.</span>
Meates, Picts, and Caledoniens, which lie beyond the Scotish sea,
receiued also the faith, by preaching of such christian elders as
aduentured thither dailie, who trauelled not without great successe and
increase of perfect godlines in that part of the Ile. Certes this
prosperous attempt passed all mens expectation, for that these nations
were in those daies reputed wild, sauage, and more vnfaithfull and
craftie than well-minded people (as the wild Irish are in my time) and
such were they (to saie the truth) in déed, as neither the sugred
courtesie, nor sharpe swords of the Romans could mollifie or restraine
from their naturall furie, or bring to anie good order. For this cause
also in the end, the Romane emperours did vtterlie cast them off as an
vnprofitable, brutish, &amp; vntameable nation, and by an huge wall herafter
to be described, separated that rude companie from the more mild and
ciuill portion.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Scotland conuerted to the faith of Christ.</span>
This conuersion of the north parts fell out in the sixt yeare before the
warres that Seuerus had in those quarters, and 170. after the death of
our sauiour Jesus Christ. From thenceforth also the christian religion
continued still among them, by the diligent care of their pastors and
bishops (after the vse of the churches of the south part of this Iland)
till the Romane shéepheard sought them out, and found the meanes to pull
them vnto him in like sort with his long staffe as he had done our
countriemen, whereby in the end he abolished the rites of the churches
of Asia there also, as Augustine had done alreadie in England: and in
stéed of the same did furnish it vp with those of his pontificall see,
although there was great contention, and no lesse bloodshed made amongst
them, before it could be brought to passe, as by the histories of both
nations yet extant may be séene.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Paladius.</span>
In the time of C&oelig;lestine bishop of Rome, who sate in the 423. of
Christ, one Paladius a Grecian borne (to whome Cyrill wrote his dialog
De adoratione in spiritu) and sometime disciple to Iohn 24. bishop of
<span class="leftnote">The first attempt of the bishop of Rome
to bring Scotland vnder his obedience.</span>
Ierusalem, came ouer from Rome into Britaine, there to suppresse the
Pelagian heresie, which not a little molested the orthodoxes of that
Iland. And hauing doone much good in the extinguishing of the aforesaid
opinion there, he went at the last also into Scotland, supposing no
lesse, but after he had trauelled somwhat in confutation of the
Pelagians in those parts, he should easilie persuade that crooked nation
to admit and receiue the rites of the church of Rome, as he would faine
haue doone beforehand in the south.
<span class="leftnote">Fastidius bishop of London.</span>
But as Fastidius Priscus archbishop of London, and his
Suffragans resisted him here; so did the Scotish prelates withstand him
there also in this behalfe: howbeit, bicause of the authoritie of his
commission, grauitie of personage, and the great gift which he had in
the veine of pleasant persuasion (whereby he drew the people after him,
as Orpheus did the stones with his harpe, and Hercules such as heard him
by his toong) they had him not onelie then in great admiration, but
their successors also from time to time, and euen now are contented
<span class="leftnote">Paladius accompted for the apostle of the Scots.</span>
(and the rather also for that he came from Rome) to take him for their
chéefe apostle, reckoning from his comming as from the faith receiued,
which was in the 431. yeare of Christ, as the truth of their historie
dooth verie well confirme.</p>

<p>Thus we see what religion hath from time to time beene receiued in this
Iland, &amp; how and when the faith of Christ came first into our countrie.
Howbeit as in processe of time it was ouershadowed, and corrupted with
the dreames and fantasticall imaginations of man, so it dailie waxed
woorse &amp; woorse, till that it pleased God to restore the preaching of
his gospell in our daies, whereby the man of sinne is now openlie
reuealed, and the puritie of the word once againe brought to light, to
the finall ouerthrow of the Romish sathan, and his popish adherents that
honour him daie and night to the vttermost of their power, yeelding vp
their harts as temples for him to dwell in, which rather ought to be the
temples of God and habitations of the Holy-ghost. But such is their
peruerse ignorance (notwithstanding that Paule hath giuen warning of him
alreadie 2. Thes. 2. calling him (as I said) the man of sinne, and
saieng that he sitteth as God in the temple of God, shewing himselfe in
<span class="page"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[Page 49]</span>
his chalenge of power,as if he were God, vnder pretense of zeale vnto
true religion) that they will not giue eare vnto the truth, but rather
shut their eares and their eies from hearing and reading of the
scriptures, bicause they will not be drawne out of his snares and
bondage.</p>

<h4>OF THE MANIFOLD CONUERSIONS AND ALTERATIONS OF THE ESTATE OF THE COMMON-WEALTH<br />
OF BRITAINE, SITHENS THE TIME OF SAMOTHES.</h4>

<p>There is a certeine period of kingdomes, of 430. yeares, in which
commonlie they suffer some notable alteration. And as in the aforesaid
season there is set a time of increase and decaie, so we find that
before the execution of Gods purpose dooth come to passe, in changing
the estate of things, sundrie tokens are sent, whereby warning is giuen,
that without repentance he will come and visit our offenses. This is
partlie verified by Ioachimus Camerarius, who in his first booke De
ostentis intreating of the same argument, telleth of a strange
earthquake felt in Delus, which was neuer touched with any such plague
before or after the ouerthrow of the Persians, giuen vnto them by the
Grecians; also of the beard that suddenlie grew out of the face of the
Pedacien prophetesse, so often as the citie was to be touched with any
alteration and change. "Nam (saith he) descriptas esse diuinitùs ætates
quibus idem humanarum rerum status duraret, quibus finitis, prædici
prius quàm existeret nouationem in deterius euenturam rerum, quæque
indies minùs ac minùs numini cordi essent. Emittuntur igitur cometæ
diuinitus, &amp; reuocantur dum supra nos conspecti quamdiu placuit Deo
inferuntur, &amp;c." Plato referreth such changes as happen in
common-wealths to a certeine diuine force that resteth hidden in sundrie
od numbers, whereof their periods do consist. True it is that God
created all things in number, weight &amp; measure, &amp; that after an
incomprehensible maner vnto our fraile &amp; humane capacitie.
Neuerthelesse, he appointed not these three to haue the rule of his
works, wherefore we must not ascribe these changes to the force of
number with Plato, much lesse then vnto destinie with the Peripatetiks,
but vnto the diuine prouidence and appointment of God, which onelie may
be called destinie as S. Augustine saith, for of other destinie it is
impietie to dreame. Aristotle ascribing all euents vnto manifest causes
precedent, dooth scoffe at Plato and his numbers in his booke of
common-wealths, and bringeth in sundrie causes of the alteration of the
state of things, which we may referre vnto principals, as iniurie,
oppression, ambition, treason, rebellion, contempt of religion and
lawes, and therevnto abundance of wealth in few, and great necessitie
and miserie in manie. But whatsoeuer Aristotle gesseth at these things
by humane reason as at the first causes, yet we acknowledge other beyond
them, as sinne, which being suffered and come to the full, is cut downe
by the iustice of the high God, the cheefe cause of all, who foreseeing
the wickednesse of such as dwell on earth, dooth constitute such a
reuolution of things in their beginnings, as best standeth with the
execution of his purpose, and correction of our errors. The causes
therefore that Aristotle dooth deliuer, are nothing else but the meanes
which God vseth to bring his purposes to passe; and yet they deserue the
name of causes, in that they preceed those effects which follow them
immediatlie. But in truth other than secondarie or third causes no man
can iustlie call them. Bodinus in his historicall method, cap. 6. making
a large discourse of the conuersions of commonwealths, dooth séeme at
the first to denie the force of number, but after a while he maruelleth
that no Grecian or Latine Academike, hath hitherto made any discourse of
the excellencie of such numbers as apperteine to the estate of empires
and kingdomes by exemplification in any one citie or other. Hereby he
sheweth himselfe vpon the sudden to alter his iudgement, so that he
<span class="leftnote">Fatal numbers.</span>
setteth downe certeine numbers as fatall; to wit, sixe vnto women, and
seauen and nine vnto men, which (saith he) haue "Magnam in tota rerum
natura potestatem," meaning as well in common-wealths and kingdomes from
their first erections, as in particular ages of bodies, for sickenesse,
health, change of habitation, wealth, and losse, &amp;c: and for the
confirmation of the same, he setteth downe sundrie examples of apparent
likelihood, either by multiplication of one by the other, or diuision of
<span class="page"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[Page 50]</span>
greater numbers by either of them, or their concurrence one with
another, calling the aforesaid three his criticall or iudiciall numbers,
whereby he bringeth or rather restoreth an old kind of arithmancie
(fathered on Pythagoras, yet neuer inuented by him) againe into the
world. But we christians, in respecting of causes, haue to looke vnto
the originall and great cause of all, and therefore we haue not to leane
vnto these points in any wise as causes: for we know and confesse that
all things depend vpon his prouidence, who humbleth and exalteth whom it
pleaseth him. Neuerthelesse, I hope we may without offense examine how
these assertions hold, so long as we vse them rather as Indices than
Causas mutationum. And therefore haue I attempted to practise at this
present the example of Bodinus, first in the alterations of our ciuill
estate passed; and secondlie, of the like in cases of religion; from the
flood generallie, and then after the first comming in of Samothes into
our Ile, thereby somewhat to satisfie my selfe, and recreate the
readers; but still protesting in the meane season that I vtterlie denie
them to be any causes, or of themselues to worke any effect at all in
these things, as Bodinus would seeme to vphold. As for those of other
countries, I referre you to Aristotles politikes, and the eight of the
common-wealth which Plato hath left vnto vs, therby to be farther
resolued, if you be desirous to looke on them. In beginning therefore
with my purpose; First bicause the flood of Noah was generall, and
therefore appertinent vnto all, it shall not be amisse to begin with
that, which was in the yeare 1656. after the creation of Adam, so that
if you diuide the same by nine, you shall find the quotient to fall out
exactlie with the 184. reuolution of the same number. Secondlie, for so
much as the confusion of toongs was the originall cause of the
dispersion of the people ouer the face of the whole earth, it shall not
be amisse also to examine the same. Certes it fell out in the 133. after
the flood: if we diuide therefore the said 133. by seauen, you shall
find the quotient 19. without any ods remaining. From hence also vnto
the comming of Samothes into Britaine, or rather his lawes giuen vnto
the Celts, and with them vnto the Britons, in the second of his arriuall
in this land, we find by exact supputation 126. yeares, which being
parted by nine or seauen sheweth such a conclusion as maketh much for
this purpose. Doubtlesse I am the more willing to touch the time of his
lawes than his entrance, sith alteration of ordinances is the cheefe and
principall token of change in rule and regiment; although at this
present the circumstances hold not, sith he dispossessed none, neither
incroched vpon any. From Samothes vnto the tyrannie of Albion, are 335.
yeares complet, so that he arriued here in the 335. or 48. septenarie,
which also concurreth with the 590 after the flood. In like sort the
regiment of Albion continued but seauen yeares, and then was the
souereingtie of this Ile restored againe by Hercules vnto the Celts. The
next alteration of our estate openlie knowne, happened by Brute,
betweene whose time and death of Albion there passed full 601. yeares
(for he spent much time after his departure out of Grecia, before he
came into Albion) so that if you accompt him to come hither in the 602.
you shall haue 86. septenaries exactlie. From Brute to the extinction of
his posteritie in Ferrex and Porrex, and pentarchie of Britaine, are
630. yeares, or 70. nouenaries, than the which where shall a man find a
more precise period after this method or prescription, for manie and
diuers considerations. The time of the pentarchie indured likewise 49.
yeares, or seauen septenaries, which being expired Dunwallo brought all
the princes vnder his subiection, and ruled ouer them as monarch of this
Ile. After the pentarchie ended, we find againe, that in the 98. yeare,
Brennus rebelled against Beline his brother, wherevpon insued cruell
bloodshed betwéene them. So that here you haue 14. septenaries, as you
haue from those warres ended, which indured a full yeare &amp; more before
Brennus was reconciled to his brother, to the comming of Cæsar into this
Iland (whereat our seruitude and miserable thraldome to the Romans may
worthilie take his entrance) 48. or 336. yeares, than the which
concurrences I know not how a man should imagine a more exact.</p>

<p>After the comming of Cæsar we haue 54. or sixe nouenaries to Christ,
whose death and passion redoundeth generallie to all that by firme and
sure faith take hold of the same, and applie it vnto their comfort. From
the birth of Christ to our countrie deliuered from the Romane yoke, are
<span class="page"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[Page 51]</span>
446. yeares, at which time the Britains chose them a king, and betooke
themselues to his obedience. But neither they nor their king being then
able to hold out the Scots and Picts, which dailie made hauocke of their
countrie; the said Vortiger in the third yeare of his reigne (which was
the 63. septenarie after Christ) did send for the Saxons, who arriued
here in the 449. and 450. yeares of Grace, in great companies, for our
aid and succour, although that in the end their entrances turned to our
vtter decaie and ruine, in that they made a conquest of the whole Ile,
and draue vs out of our liuings. Hereby we sée therefore how the
preparatiue began in the 449. but how it was finished in the tenth
nouenarie, the sequele is too too plaine. In like sort in the 43.
nouenarie or 387. after the comming of the Saxons, the Danes entred, who
miserablie afflicted this Ile by the space of 182. yeares or 46.
septenaries, which being expired, they established themselues in the
kingdome by Canutus. But their time lasting not long, the Normans
followed in the end of the 49. yeare, and thus you sée how these numbers
do hold exactlie vnto the conquest. The like also we find of the
continuance of the Normans or succession of the Conquerour, which
indured but 89. yeares, being extinguished in Stephen, and that of the
Saxons restored in Henrie the second, although it lacke one whole yeare
of ten nouenaries, which is a small thing, sith vpon diuers occasions
the time of the execution of any accident may be preuented or proroged,
as in direction and progression astronomicall is oftentimes perceiued.
From hence to the infamous excommunication of England in king Iohns
daies, wherevpon insued the resignation of his crownes and dominions to
the pope, are eight septenaries or 56. yeares. Thence againe to the
deposition of Richard. 2. and vsurpation of Henrie 4. are 77. yeares or
11. septenaries. From hence to the conspiracie made against Edward. 2.
after which he was deposed &amp; murdered are 117. yeares, or 13.
nouenaries. From hence to the beginning of the quarell betwéene the
houses of Yorke and Lancaster (wherein foure score and od persons of the
blood roiall were slaine and made awaie first and last, and which warres
begunne in the 1448. and the yeare after the death of the Duke of
Glocester, whose murther séemed to make frée passage to the said broile)
are 72. yeares or eight nouenaries. From hence to the translation of the
crowne from the house of Lancaster to that of Yorke, in Edward the 4.
are 14. yeares or two septenaries, and last of all to the vnion of the
said houses in Henrie the eight, is an exact quadrat of seuen multiplied
in it selfe, or 49. yeares, whereof I hope this may in part suffice.</p>

<p>Now as concerning religion, we haue from Christ to the faith first
preached in Britaine (by Iosephus ab Aramathia, and Simon Zelotes) as
some write 70. yeares or 10. septenaries. Thence also to the baptisme of
Lucius, and his nobilitie in the yeare after their conuersion, 12.
nouenaries or 108. yeares. After these the Saxons entred and changed the
state of religion for the most part into paganisme, in the yeare 449.
39. nouenarie, and 273. yeare after Lucius had beene baptised, which is
39. septenaries, if I be not deceiued. In the 147. or 21. septenarie,
Augustine came, who brought in poperie, which increased and continued
till Wicklif with more boldnesse than anie other began to preach the
gospell, which was Anno. 1361. or 765. yeares after the comming of
Augustine, and yeeld 85. nouenaries exactlie. From hence againe to the
<span class="leftnote">Henrie 8.</span>
expulsion of the pope 175. yeares, or 25. septenaries, thence to the
<span class="leftnote"><br />Marie.</span>
receiuing of the pope and popish doctrine 21. yeares or 3. septenaries,
wherevnto I would ad the time of restoring the gospell by Quéene
Elizabeth, were it not that it wanteth one full yeare of 7. Whereby we
may well gather, that if there be anie hidden mysterie or thing
conteined in these numbers, yet the same extendeth not vnto the diuine
disposition of things, touching the gift of grace and frée mercie vnto
the penitent, vnto which neither number weight nor measure shall be able
to aspire.</p>

<small>OF SUCH ILANDS AS ARE TO BE SEENE VPON THE COASTS OF BRITAINE.</small><br />

CAP. 10.</h3>

<p>There are néere vnto, or not verie farre from the coasts of Britaine
many faire Ilands, wherof Ireland with hir neighbors (not here handled)
séeme to be the cheefe. But of the rest, some are much larger or lesse
than other, diuers in like sort enuironed continuallie with the salt sea
(whereof I purpose onelie to intreat, although not a few of them be
Ilands but at the floud) and other finallie be clipped partlie by the
fresh and partlie by the salt water, or by the fresh alone, whereof I
may speake afterward.</p>

<p>Of these salt Ilands (for so I call them that are enuironed with the
Ocean waues) some are fruitfull in wood, corne, wild foule, and pasture
ground for cattell, albeit that manie of them be accounted barren,
bicause they are onelie replenished with conies, and those of sundrie
colours (cherished of purpose by the owners, for their skins or carcases
in their prouision of household) without either man or woman otherwise
inhabiting in them. Furthermore, the greatest number of these Ilands
haue townes and parish-churches, within their seuerall precincts, some
mo, some lesse: and beside all this, are so inriched with commodities,
that they haue pleasant hauens, fresh springs, great store of fish, and
plentie of cattell, wherby the inhabitants doo reape no small aduantage.
How manie they are in number I cannot as yet determine, bicause mine
informations are not so fullie set downe, as the promises of some on the
one side, &amp; mine expectation on the other did extend vnto. Howbeit,
first of all that there are certeine which lie neere togither, as it
were by heapes and clusters, I hope none will readilie denie.
<span class="leftnote">Nesiadæ.<br />
Insulæ Scylurum.<br />
Sileustræ.<br />
Syllanæ.<br />
Sorlingæ.<br />
Sylley.</span>
Of these also those called the Nesiadæ, Insulæ Scylurum, Sileustræ,
Syllanæ, now the Sorlings, and Iles of Silley, lieng beyond Cornwall are
one, and conteineth in number one hundreth fourtie and seauen (each of
them bearing grasse) besides shelfes and shallowes. In like sort the
<span class="rightnote">Hebrides.<br />
Hebudes.<br />
Meuaniæ.<br />
Orchades.</span>
companie of the Hebrides in old time subject vnto Ireland are another,
which are said to be 43. situat vpon the west side of this Iland,
betweene Ireland &amp; Scotland, and of which there are some that repute
Anglesei, Mona Cæsaris, and other lieng betweene them to be parcell, in
their corrupted iudgement. The third cluster or bunch consisteth of
those that are called the Orchades, and these lie vpon the northwest
point of Scotland, being 31. aliàs 28. in number, as for the rest they
lie scattered here and there, and yet not to be vntouched as their
courses shall come about. There are also the 18. Shetland Iles, and
other yet farther distant from them, of which Iohn Frobuser I doubt not
touched vpon some in his voiage to Meta Incognita: but for somuch as I
must speake of the Shetlands hereafter, I doo not meane to spend anie
time about them as yet.</p>

<p>There haue beene diuers that haue written of purpose, De insulis
Britanniæ, as Cæsar doth confesse. The like also may be seene by
Plutarch, who nameth one Demetrius a Britaine, that should set foorth an
exact treatise of each of them in order, and among other tell of
certeine desert Iles beyond Scotland dedicated to sundrie gods and
goddesses, but of one especiallie, where Briareus should hold Saturne
and manie other spirits fast bound with the chaines of an heauie sléepe,
as he heard, of which some die now and then, by meane wherof the aire
becommeth maruellouslie troubled, &amp;c: as you may sée in Plutarch De
cessatione oraculorum, &amp;c. But sith those bookes are now perished, and
the most of the said Ilands remaine vtterlie vnknowen, euen to our owne
selues (for who is able in our time to say where is Glota, Hiucrion,
Etta, Iduna, Armia, Æsarea, Barsa, Isiandium, Icdelis, Xantisma,
Indelis, Siata, Ga. Andros or Edros, Siambis, Xanthos, Ricnea, Menapia,
&amp;c? whose names onelie are left in memorie by ancient writers, but I
saie their places not so much as heard of in our daies) I meane (God
willing) to set downe so manie of them with their commodities, as I doo
either know by Leland, or am otherwise instructed of by such as are of
credit. Herein also I will touch at large those that are most famous,
and breeflie passe ouer such as are obscure and vnknowen, making mine
<span class="page"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[Page 53]</span>
entrance at the Thames mouth, and directing this imagined course (for I
neuer sailed it) by the south part of the Iland into the west. From
thence in like sort I will proceed into the north, &amp; come about againe
by the east side into the fall of the aforesaid streame, where I will
strike saile, and safelie be set ashore, that haue often in this voiage
wanted water, but oftener béene set a ground, especiallie on the Scotish
side.</p>

<p>In beginning therefore, with such as lie in the mouth of the aforesaid
<span class="leftnote">Hoo.</span>
riuer, I must néeds passe by the How, which is not an Iland, and
therefore not within the compasse of my description at this time, but
almost an Iland, which parcels the Latins call Peninsulas, and I doo
english a Byland, vsing the word for such as a man may go into
drie-footed at the full sea, or on horssebacke at the low water without
anie boat or vessell: and such a one almost is Rochford hundred in Essex
also, yet not at this time to be spoken of, bicause not the sea onelie
but the fresh water also doth in maner enuiron it, and is the cheefe
occasion wherfore it is called an Iland. This How lieth between Cliffe
(in old time called Clouesho, to wit, Cliffe in How or in the hundred of
How) &amp; the midwaie that goeth along by Rochester, of which hundred there
goeth an old prouerbe in rime after this maner:</p>

<p class="ind1">He that rideth into the hundred of How,<br />
Beside pilfering sea-men shall find durt ynow.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Greane.</span>
Next vnto this we haue the Greane, wherein is a towne of the same
denomination, an Ile supposed to be foure miles in length, and two in
<span class="leftnote"><br />Shepey.</span>
bredth. Then come we to Shepey, which Ptolomie calleth Connos,
conteining seauen miles in length, and three in bredth, wherein is a
castell called Quinborow, and a parke, beside foure townes, of which one
is named Minster, another Eastchurch, the third Warden, and the fourth
Leyden: the whole soile being throughlie fed with shéepe, verie well
woodded, and (as I heare) belongeth to the Lord Cheyney, as parcell of
his inheritance. It lieth thirtéene miles by water from Rochester, but
the castell is fiftéene, and by south thereof are two small Ilands,
<span class="leftnote">Elmesie.<br />
Hertesie.</span>
wherof the one is called Elmesie, and the more easterlie Hertesie. In
this also is a towne called Hertie, or Hartie, and all in the Lath of
Scraie, notwithstanding that Hartie lieth in the hundred of Feuersham,
and Shepey reteineth one especiall Bailie of hir owne.</p>

<p>From hence we passe by the Reculuers (or territorie belonging in time
past to one Raculphus, who erected an house of religion, or some such
thing there) vnto a little Iland in the Stoure mouth. Herevpon also
<span class="leftnote">Stureev.<br />
Thanet.</span>
the Thanet abutteth, which Ptolomie calleth Toliapis, other Athanatos,
bicause serpents are supposed not to liue in the same, howbeit sith it
is not enuironed with the sea, it is not to be dealt withall as an Iland
in this place, albeit I will not let to borow of my determination, and
describe it as I go, bicause it is so fruitfull. Beda noteth it in times
past to haue conteined 600. families, which are all one with Hidelands,
*Ploughlands, Carrucates, or Temewares. He addeth also that it is
<span class="rightnote">* In Lincolneshire the word Hide or hideland,
was neuer in vse in old time as in other places, but for
Hide they vsed the word Carucate or cartware, or Teme,
and these were of no lesse compasse than an Hideland.
<em>Ex Hugone le blanc Monacho Petrolurgensi.</em></span>
diuided from our continent, by the riuer called Wantsume, which is about
thrée furlongs broad, and to be passed ouer in two places onelie. But
whereas Polydore saieth, the Thanet is nine miles in length &amp; not much
lesse in bredth, it is now reckoned that it hath not much aboue seauen
miles from Nordtmuth to Sandwich, and foure in bredth, from the Stoure
to Margate, or from the south to the north, the circuit of the whole
being 17. or 18. as Leland also noteth. This Iland hath no wood growing
in it except it be forced, and yet otherwise it is verie fruitfull, and
beside that it wanteth few other commodities, the finest chalke is said
to be found there. Herein also did Augustine the moonke first arriue,
when he came to conuert the Saxons, and afterward in processe of time,
sundry religious houses were erected there, as in a soile much bettered
(as the supersticious supposed) by the steps of that holy man, &amp; such as
came ouer with him. There are at this time 10. parish churches at the
least in the Ile of Thanet, as S. Nicholas, Birchington, S. Iohns, Wood
or Woodchurch, S. Peters, S. Laurence, Mownton or Monkeron, Minster, S.
Gyles and all Saincts, whereof M. Lambert hath written at large in his
description of Kent, and placed the same in the Lath of sainct Augustine
and hundred of Kingslow, as may easilie be séene to him that will peruse
it.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[Page 54]</span></p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Rutupium.</span>
Sometime Rutupium or (as Beda calleth it) Reptacester, stood also in
this Iland, but now thorough alteration of the chanell of the Dour, it
is shut quite out, and annexed to the maine. It is called in these daies
Richborow, and as it should seeme builded vpon an indifferent soile or
high ground. The large brickes also yet to be seene there, in the
ruinous walles, declare either the Romane or the old British
workemanship. But as time decaieth all things, so Rutupium named
Ruptimuth is now become desolate, and out of the dust thereof Sandwich
producted, which standeth a full mile from the place where Reptacester
stood. The old writers affirme, how Arthur &amp; Mordred fought one notable
battell here, wherin Gwallon or Gawan was slaine; at which time the said
rebell came against his souereigne with 70000. Picts, Scots, Irish,
Norwegians, &amp;c: and with Ethelbert the first christian king of Kent did
hold his palace in this towne, and yet none of his coine hath hitherto
béene found there, as is dailie that of the Romanes, whereof manie
péeces of siluer and gold, so well as of brasse, copper, and other
mettall haue often beene shewed vnto me. It should appéere in like sort,
that of this place, all the whole coast of Kent therabout was called
Littus Rutupinum, which some doo not a little confirme by these words of
Lucane, to be read in his sixt booke soone after the beginning:<br /><span class="leftnote">The last verse of one couple and first of an other.</span></p>

<p class="ind1a">Aut vaga cum Tethis, Rutupináq; littora feruent,<br />
Vnda Calidonios fallit turbata Britannos.</p>

<p class="ind2">Or when the wandering seas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Kentish coasts doo worke,<br />
And Calidons of British bloud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the troubled waues beguile.</p>

<p>Meaning in like sort by the latter, the coast néere Andredeswald, which
in time past was called Littus Calidonium of that wood or forrest, as
Leland also confirmeth. But as it is not my mind to deale anie thing
curiouslie in these by-matters, so in returning againe to my purpose,
<span class="leftnote">Seolesey of Seles there taken.</span>
and taking my iourney toward the Wight, I must needs passe by Selesey,
which sometime (as it should séeme) hath béene a noble Iland, but now in
maner a Byland or Peninsula, wherin the chéefe sée of the bishop of
Chichester was holden by the space of thrée hundred twentie nine yeares,
and vnder twentie bishops.</p>

<p>Next vnto this, we come vnto those that lie betweene the Wight and the
<span class="leftnote">Thorne.</span>
maine land, of which the most easterlie is called Thorne, and to saie
truth, the verie least of all that are to be found in that knot. Being
<span class="leftnote">Haling.</span>
past the Thorne, we touched vpon the Haling, which is bigger than the
Thorne, and wherein one towne is situat of the same denomination beside
<span class="leftnote">Port.</span>
another, whose name I remember not. By west also of the Haling lieth the
Port (the greatest of the three alreadie mentioned) and in this standeth
Portsmouth and Ringstéed) whereof also our Leland, saieth thus: "Port
Ile is cut from the shore by an arme of the maine hauen, which breaketh
out about thrée miles aboue Portsmouth, and goeth vp two miles or more
by morish ground to a place called Portbridge, which is two miles from
Portsmouth." Then breaketh there out another créeke from the maine sea,
about Auant hauen, which gulleth vp almost to Portbridge, and thence is
the ground disseuered, so that Portsmouth standeth in a corner of this
Ile, which Iland is in length six miles, and three miles in bredth,
verie good for grasse and corne, not without some wood, and here and
there inclosure. Beside this, there is also another Iland north
northwest of Port Ile, which is now so worne and washed awaie with the
working of the sea, that at the spring tides it is wholie couered with
water, and thereby made vnprofitable. Finallie being past all these, and
in compassing this gulfe, we come by an other, which lieth north of
Hirst castell, &amp; southeast of Kaie hauen, whereof I find nothing worthie
to be noted, sauing that it wanteth wood, as Ptolomie affirmeth in his
Geographicall tables of all those Ilands which enuiron our Albion.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Wight.<br />
Guidh.</span>
The Wight is called in Latine Vectis, but in the British speach Guidh,
that is to saie, Eefe or easie to be séene, or (as D. Caius saith)
separate, bicause that by a breach of the sea, it was once diuided
<span class="page"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[Page 55]</span>
from the maine, as Sicilia was also from Italie, Anglesei from Wales,
Foulenesse from Essex, &amp; Quinborow from Kent. It lieth distant from the
south shore of Britaine (where it is fardest off) by fiue miles &amp; a
halfe, but where it commeth neerest, not passing a thousand paces, and
this at the cut ouer betwéene Hirst castell and a place called Whetwell
chine, as the inhabitants doo report. It conteineth in length twentie
miles, and in bredth ten, it hath also the north pole eleuated by 50.
degrées and 27. minutes, and is onelie 18. degrees in distance, and 50.
od minuts from the west point, as experience hath confirmed, contrarie
to the description of Ptolomie, and such as folow his assertions in the
same. In forme, it representeth almost an eg, and so well is it
inhabited with meere English at this present, that there are thirtie six
townes, villages and castels to be found therein, beside 27.
parish-churches, of which 15. or 16. haue their Parsons, the rest either
such poore Vicars or Curats, as the liuings left are able to sustaine.
The names of the parishes in the Wight are these.</p>

<p>It belongeth for temporall iurisdiction to the countie of Hamshire, but
in spirituall cases it yéeldeth obedience to the sée of Winchester,
wherof it is a Deanerie. As for the soile of the whole Iland, it is
verie fruitfull, for notwithstanding the shore of it selfe be verie full
of rocks and craggie cliffes, yet there wanteth no plentie of cattell,
corne, pasture, medow ground, wild foule, fish, fresh riuers, and
pleasant woods, whereby the inhabitants may liue in ease and welfare. It
was first ruled by a seuerall king, and afterwards wonne from the
Britons by Vespasian the legat, at such time as he made a voiage into
the west countrie. In processe of time also it was gotten from the
Romans by the kings of Sussex, who held the souereigntie of the same,
and kept the king thereof vnder tribute, till it was wonne also from
them, in the time of Athelwold, the eight king of the said south region,
by Ceadwalla, who killed Aruald that reigned there, and reserued the
souereigntie of that Ile to himselfe and his successors for euermore. At
this time also there were 1200. families in that Iland, whereof the said
Ceadwalla gaue 300 to Wilfride sometime bishop of Yorke, exhorting him
to erect a church there, and preach the gospell also to the inhabitants
thereof, which he in like maner performed, but according to the
prescriptions of the church of Rome, wherevnto he yéelded himselfe
vassall and feudarie: so that this Ile by Wilfride was first conuerted
to the faith, though the last of all other that hearkened vnto the word.
After Ceadwalla, Woolfride the parricide was the first Saxon prince that
aduentured to flie into the Wight for his safegard, whither he was
driuen by Kenwalch of the Westsaxons, who made great warres vpon him,
and in the end compelled him to go into this place for succour, as did
also king Iohn, in the rebellious stir of his Barons, practised by the
clergie: the said Iland being as then in possession of the Forts, as
some doo write that haue handled it of purpose. The first Earle of this
Iland that I doo read of, was one Baldwijne de Betoun, who married for
his second wife, the daughter of William le Grosse Earle of Awmarle; but
<span class="page"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[Page 56]</span>
he dieng without issue by this ladie, she was maried the second time to
Earle Maundeuille, and thirdlie to William de Fortes, who finished
Skipton castell, which his wiues father had begun about the time of king
Richard the first. Hereby it came to passe also, that the Forts were
Earls of Awmarle, Wight, and Deuonshire a long time, till the ladie
Elizabeth Fortes, sole heire to all those possessions came to age, with
whom king Edward the third so preuailed through monie &amp; faire words,
that he gat the possession of the Wight wholie into his hands, &amp; held it
to himselfe &amp; his successors, vntill Henrie the sixt, about the
twentieth of his reigne, crowned Henrie Beauchamp sonne to the lord
Richard Earle of Warwike king thereof and of Iardesey and Gardesey with
his owne hands, and therevnto gaue him a commendation of the Dutchie of
Warwike with the titles of Comes comitum Angliæ, lord Spenser of
Aburgauenie, and of the castell of Bristow (which castell was sometime
taken from his ancestors by king Iohn) albeit he did not long enioy
these great honors, sith he died 1446. without issue, and seuen yéeres
after his father.</p>

<p>After we be past the Wight, we go forward and come vnto Poole hauen,
<span class="leftnote">Brunt Keysy.</span>
wherein is an Ile, called Brunt Keysy, in which was sometime a
parish-church, and but a chapell at this present, as I heare. There are
also two other Iles, but as yet I know not their names.</p>

<p>We haue (after we are passed by these) another Ile, or rather Byland
<span class="leftnote">Portland.</span>
also vpon the coast named Portland not far from Waymouth or the Gowy, a
prettie fertile peece though without wood, of ten miles in circuit, now
well inhabited, but much better heretofore, and yet are there about
foure score housholds in it. There is but one street of houses therein,
the rest are dispersed, howbeit they belong all to one parish-church,
whereas in time past there were two within the compasse of the same.
There is also a castell of the kings, who is lord of the Ile, although
the bishop of Winchester be patrone of the church, the parsonage whereof
is the fairest house in all the péece. The people there are no lesse
excellent slingers of stones than were the Baleares, who would neuer
giue their children their dinners till they had gotten the same with
their slings, and therefore their parents vsed to hang their meate verie
high vpon some bough, to the end that he which strake it downe might
onlie haue it, whereas such as missed were sure to go without it, Florus
lib. 3. cap. 8. Which feat the Portlands vse for the defense of their
Iland, and yet otherwise are verie couetous. And wheras in time past
they liued onlie by fishing, now they fall to tillage. Their fire bote
is brought out of the Wight, and other places, yet doo they burne much
cow doong dried in the sunne, for there is I saie no wood in the Ile,
except a few elmes that be about the church. There would some grow
there, no doubt, if they were willing to plant it, although the soile
lie verie bleake and open. It is not long since this was vnited to the
maine, and likelie yer long to be cut off againe.</p>

<p>Being past this we raise another, also in the mouth of the Gowy,
betweene Colsford and Lime, of which for the smalnesse thereof I make no
great account. Wherefore giuing ouer to intreat any farther of it, I
<span class="leftnote">Iardsey.<br />
Gardesey.</span>
cast about to Iardsey, and Gardesey, which Iles with their appurtenances
apperteined in times past to the Dukes of Normandie, but now they
remaine to our Quéene, as parcell of Hamshire and iurisdiction of
Winchester, &amp; belonging to hir crowne, by meanes of a composition made
betwéene K. Iohn of England and the K. of France, when the dominions of
the said prince began so fast to decrease, as Thomas Sulmo saith.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Iardsey.</span>
Of these two, Iardsey is the greatest, an Iland hauing thirtie miles in
compasse, as most men doo coniecture. There are likewise in the same
twelue parish-churches, with a colledge, which hath a Deane and
Prebends. It is distant from Gardsey full 21. miles, or thereabouts, and
made notable, by meanes of a bloudie fact doone there in Queene Maries
daies, whereby a woman called Perotine Massie wife vnto an honest
minister or préest, being great with childe by hir husband, was burned
to ashes: through the excéeding crueltie of the Deane and Chapiter, then
contending manifestlie against God for the mainteinance of their popish
and antichristian kingdome. In this hir execution, and at such time as
the fire caught holde of hir wombe, hir bellie brake, and there issued a
goodly manchilde from hir, with such force that it fell vpon the cold
<span class="page"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[Page 57]</span>
ground quite beyond the heate and furie of the flame, which quicklie was
<span class="rightnote">Horrible murther.</span>
taken vp and giuen from one tormentor and aduersarie to an other to
looke vpon, whose eies being after a while satisfied with the beholding
thereof, they threw it vnto the carcase of the mother which burned in
the fire, whereby the poore innocent was consumed to ashes, whom that
<span class="leftnote">Gardsey.</span>
furious element would gladlie haue left vntouched, &amp; wherevnto it
ministred (as you heare) an hurtlesse passage. In this latter also,
there haue béene in times past, fine religious houses, and nine castels,
howbeit in these daies there is but one parish-church left standing in
the same. There are also certeine other small Ilands, which Henrie
<span class="leftnote">S. Hilaries.</span>
the second in his donation calleth Insulettas, beside verie manie rocks,
whereof one called S. Hilaries (wherein sometime was a monasterie) is
fast vpon Iardsey, another is named the Cornet, which hath a castel not
<span class="leftnote">Cornet. Serke.</span>
passing an arrow shot from Gardsey. The Serke also is betwéene both,
which is six miles about, and hath another annexed to it by an Isthmus
or Strictland, wherein was a religious house, &amp; therwithall great store
of conies.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Brehoc.<br />
Gytho.<br />
Herme.</span>
There is also the Brehoc, the Gytho, and the Herme, which latter is
foure miles in compasse, and therein was sometime a Canonrie, that
afterward was conuerted into a house of Franciscanes. There are two
other likewise neere vnto that of S. Hilarie, of whose names I haue no
<span class="rightnote">Burhoo, aliàs the Ile of rats.</span>
notice. There is also the rockie Ile of Burhoo, but now the Ile of rats,
so called of the huge plentie of rats that are found there, though
otherwise it be replenished with infinit store of conies, betwéene whome
<span class="rightnote">Turkie conies.</span>
and the rats, as I coniecture, the same which we call Turkie conies, are
oftentimes produced among those few houses that are to be seene in this
Iland. Some are of the opinion that there hath béene more store of
building in this Ile than is at this present to be seene, &amp; that it
became abandoned through multitudes of rats, but hereof I find no
perfect warrantise that I may safelie trust vnto, yet in other places I
read of the like thing to haue happened, as in Gyara of the Cyclades,
where the rats increased so fast that they draue away the people. Varro
speaketh of a towne in Spaine that was ouerthrowne by conies. The
Abderits were driuen out of Thracia by the increase of mice &amp; frogs; and
so manie conies were there on a time in the Iles Maiorca and Minorca
(now perteining to Spaine) that the people began to starue for want of
bread, and their cattell for lacke of grasse. And bicause the Ilanders
were not able to ouercome them, Augustus was constreined to send an
armie of men to destroie that needlesse brood. Plin. lib. 8. cap. 55.
<span class="leftnote">Causes of the desolation of sundrie cities and townes.</span>
A towne also in France sometime became desolate onelie by frogs and
todes. Another in Africa by locustes and also by grashoppers, as Amicla
was by snakes and adders. Theophrast telleth of an whole countrie
consumed by the palmer-worme, which is like vnto an huge caterpiller.
Plinie writeth of a prouince vpon the borders of Æthiopia made void of
people by ants and scorpions, and how the citizens of Megara in Grecia
were faine to leaue that citie through multitudes of bées, as waspes had
almost driuen the Ephesians out of Ephesus. But this of all other
(whereof Ælianus intreateth) is most woonderfull, that when the
Cretenses were chased out of a famous citie of their Iland by infinit
numbers of bees, the said bees conuerted their houses into hiues, and
made large combes in them which reached from wall to wall, wherein they
reserued their honie. Which things being dulie considered, I doo not
denie the possibilitie of the expulsion of the inhabitants out of the
Ile of Burhoo by rats, although I say that I doo not warrant the effect,
bicause I find it not set downe directlie in plaine words.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Alderney.</span>
Beside this there is moreouer the Ile of Alderney a verie pretie plot,
about seuen miles in compasse, wherin a préest not long since did find a
coffin of stone, in which lay the bodie of an huge giant, whose fore
<span class="rightnote"><em>Comment. Brit.</em></span>
téeth were so big as a mans fist, as Leland dooth report. Certes this to
me is no maruell at all, sith I haue read of greater, and mentioned them
alreadie in the beginning of this booke. Such a tooth also haue they in
Spaine wherevnto they go in pilgrimage as vnto S. Christophers tooth,
but it was one of his eie teeth, if Ludouicus Viues say true, who went
thither to offer vnto the same. S. August. de ciuit. lib. 15. cap. 9.
writeth in like sort, of such another found vpon the coast of Vtica, and
thereby gathereth that all men in time past were not onlie far greater
than they be now, but also the giants farre exceeding the huge stature
<span class="page"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[Page 58]</span>
<span class="rightnote"><em>Iliad. 6.</em></span>
and height of the highest of them all. Homer complaineth that men in his
time were but dwarfes in comparison of such as liued in the wars of Troy.
<span class="rightnote"><em>Iliad. 5. &amp; 7.</em></span>
See his fift Iliad, where he speaketh of Diomedes, and how he threw a
stone at Æneas, (which 14. men of his time were not able to stirre) and
<span class="rightnote"><em>Vergilius Aen. 12.</em></span>
therewith did hit him on the thigh and ouerthrew him. Virgil also noteth
no lesse in his owne deuise, but Iuvenal bréefelie comprehendeth all
this in his 15. Satyra, where he saith:</p>

<p class="ind1">Saxa inclinatis per humum quæsita lacertis<br />
Incipiunt torquere, domestica seditione<br />
Tela, nec hunc lapidem, quali se Turnus, &amp; Aiax,<br />
Et quo Tytides percussit pondere coxam<br />
Aeneæ: sed quem valeant emittere dextræ<br />
Illis dissimiles, &amp; nostro tempore nata.<br />
Nam genus hoc viuo iam decrescebat Homero,<br />
Terra malos homines nunc educat, atque pusillos,<br />
Ergo Deus quicunque aspexit, ridet, &amp; odit.</p>

<p>But to returne againe vnto the Ile of Alderney, from whence I haue
digressed. Herein also is a prettie towne with a parish-church, great
plentie of corne, cattell, conies, and wilde foule, whereby the
inhabitants doo reape much gaine and commoditie: onelie wood is their
want, which they otherwise supplie. The language also of such as dwell
in these Iles, is French; but the wearing of their haire long, &amp; the
attire of those that liued in Gardsey and Iardsey, vntill the time of
king Henrie the eight, was all after the Irish guise. The Ile of Gardsey
also was sore spoiled by the French 1371. and left so desolate, that
onlie one castell remained therein vntouched.</p>

<p>Beyond this, and neerer unto the coast of England (for these doo lie
about the verie middest of the British sea) we haue one Iland called
<span class="leftnote">Bruchsey.</span>
the Bruch or the Bruchsey, lieng about two miles from Poole, whither men
saile from the Fromouth, and wherein is nought else, but an old chapell,
without any other housing.</p>

<p>Next to this also are certeine rocks, which some take for Iles, as
Illeston rocke néere vnto Peritorie, Horestan Ile a mile from Peritorie
by south, Blacke rocke Ile southeast from Peritorie toward Teygnemouth,
and also Chester, otherwise called Plegimundham: but how (to saie truth)
or where this latter lieth, I cannot make report as yet, neuerthelesse
sith Leland noteth them togither, I thinke it not my part to make
separation of them.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Mount Iland.</span>
From hence the next Ile is called Mount Iland, otherwise Mowtland,
situate ouer against Lough, about two miles from the shore, and well
néere thrée miles in compasse. This Iland hath no inhabitants, but
onelie the warrenner and his dog, who looketh vnto the conies there:
notwithstanding that vpon the coast thereof in time of the yeere, great
store of pilchards is taken, and carried from thence into manie places
of our countrie. It hath also a fresh well comming out of the rocks,
which is worthie to be noted in so small a compasse of ground. Moreouer
in the mouth of the créeke that leadeth vnto Lough, or Loow, as some
<span class="leftnote">S. Nicholas Iland.</span>
call it, there is another little Iland of about eight acres of ground
called S. Nicholas Ile, and midwaie betweene Falmouth and Dudman (a
<span class="rightnote">Greefe.</span>
certeine Promontorie) is such another named the Gréefe, wherein is great
<span class="leftnote"><br />Inis Prynin.</span>
store of gulles &amp; sea foule. As for Inis Prynin, it lieth within the
Baie, about three miles from Lizards, and containeth not aboue two acres
of ground, from which Newltjn is not far distant, and wherein is a poore
fisher-towne and a faire wel-spring, wherof as yet no writer hath made
mention. After these (omitting Pendinant in the point of Falmouth hauen)
<span class="leftnote">S. Michaels mount.</span>
we came at last to saint Michaels mount, whereof I find this description
readie to my hand in Leland.</p>

<p>The compasse of the root of the mount of saint Michael is not much more
than halfe a mile, and of this the south part is pasturable and bréedeth
conies, the residue high and rockie soile. In the north side thereof
also is a garden, with certeine houses and shops for fishermen.
Furthermore, the waie to the mountaine lieth at the north side, and is
<span class="page"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[Page 59]</span>
frequented from halfe eb to halfe floud, the entrance beginning at the
foot of the hill, and so ascending by steps and greeces westward, first;
and then eastward to the vtter ward of the church. Within the same ward
also is a court stronglie walled, wherein on the south side is a chapell
of S. Michaell, and in the east side another of our ladie. Manie times a
man may come to the hill on foot. On the north northwest side hereof
also, is a Piere for botes and ships, and in the Baie betwixt the mount
and Pensardz are seene at the lowe water marke, diuers roots and stubs
of trées, beside hewen stone, sometimes of doores &amp; windowes, which are
perceiued in the inner part of the Baie, and import that there hath not
onelie beene building, but also firme ground, whereas the salt water
doth now rule and beare the maisterie. Beyond this is an other little
<span class="leftnote">S. Clements Ile.</span>
Ile, called S. Clements Ile, of a chapell there dedicated to that saint.
It hath a little from it also the Ile called Mowshole, which is not
touched in any Chard. As for Mowshole it selfe, it is a towne of the
maine, called in Cornish Port Enis, that is, Portus insulæ, whereof the
said Ile taketh denomination, and in tin workes néere vnto the same
there hath beene found of late, speare heds, battell axes, and swords of
copper wrapped vp in linnen, and scarselie hurt with rust or other
hinderance. Certes the sea hath won verie much in this corner of our
Iland, but chéefelie betwéene Mowshole and Pensardz.</p>

<p>Hauing thus passed ouer verie neere all such Iles, as lie vpon the south
coast of Britaine, and now being come vnto the west part of our
countrie, a sudden Pirie catcheth hold of vs (as it did before, when we
went to Iardsey) and carrieth vs yet more westerlie among the flats of
<span class="leftnote">Sylley Iles or Syl.</span>
Sylley. Such force dooth the southeast wind often shewe vpon poore
trauellers in those parts, as the south and southwest dooth vpon
strangers against the British coast, that are not skilfull of our rodes
and harborowes. Howbeit such was our successe in this voiage, that we
feared no rocks, more than did king Athelstane, when he subdued them
(and soone after builded a colledge of preests at S. Burien, in
performance of his vow made when he enterprised this voiage for his safe
returne) nor anie tempest of weather in those parts that could annoie
our passage. Perusing therefore the perils whereinto we were pitifullie
plunged, we found the Syllane Ilands (places often robbed by the
Frenchmen and Spaniards) to lie distant from the point of Cornewall,
about three or foure hours sailing, or twentie English miles, as some
men doo account it. There are of these (as I said) to the number of one
hundreth fortie seauen in sight, whereof each one is greater or lesse
than other, and most of them sometime inhabited: howbeit, there are
twentie of them, which for their greatnesse and commodities excéed all
the rest. Thereto (if you respect their position) they are situat in
maner of a circle or ring, hauing an huge lake or portion of the sea in
the middest of them, which is not without perill to such as with small
aduisement enter into the same. Certes it passeth my cunning, either to
name or to describe all these one hundreth fourtie seauen, according to
their estate; neither haue I had anie information of them, more than I
haue gathered by Leland, or gotten out of a map of their description,
which I had sometime of Reginald Woolfe: wherfore omitting as it were
all the rags, and such as are not worthie to haue anie time spent about
their particular descriptions, I will onelie touch the greatest, and
those that lie togither (as I said) in maner of a roundle.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">S. Maries Ile.</span>
The first and greatest of these therefore, called S. Maries Ile, is
about fiue miles ouer, or nine miles in compasse. Therein also is a
parish-church, and a poore towne belonging thereto, of threescore
housholds, beside a castell, plentie of corne, conies, wild swans,
puffens, gulles, cranes, &amp; other kinds of foule in great abundance. This
fertile Iland being thus viewed, we sailed southwards by the Norman
<span class="leftnote">Agnus Ile.</span>
rocke, and S. Maries sound vnto Agnus Ile, which is six miles ouer, and
hath in like sort one towne or parish within the same of fiue or six
housholds, beside no small store of hogs &amp; conies of sundrie colours,
verie profitable to their owners. It is not long since this Ile was left
desolate, for when the inhabitants thereof returned from a feast holden
in S. Maries Ile, they were all drowned, and not one person left aliue.
<span class="rightnote">Annot.</span>
There are also two other small Ilands, betwéene this and the Annot,
whereof I find nothing worthie relation: for as both of them ioind
togither are not comparable to the said Annot for greatnesse and
<span class="page"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[Page 60]</span>
circuit, so they want both hogs and conies, wherof Annot hath great
<span class="rightnote">Minwisand.<br />
Smithy sound.<br />
Suartigan.<br />
Rousuian.<br />
Rousuiar.<br />
Cregwin.</span>
plentie. There is moreouer the Minwisand, from whence we passe by the
Smithy sound (leauing thrée little Ilands on the left hand, vnto the
Suartigan Iland, then to Rousuian, Rousuiar, and the Cregwin, which
seauen are (for the most part) replenished with conies onelie, and wild
garlike, but void of wood &amp; other commodities, sauing of a short kind of
grasse, or here &amp; there some firzes wheron their conies doo féed.</p>

<p>Leauing therefore these desert peeces, we incline a little toward the
<span class="leftnote">Moncarthat.<br />
Inis Welseck.<br />
Suethiall.<br />
Rat Iland.</span>
northwest, where we stumble or run vpon Moncarthat, Inis Welseck, &amp;
Suethiall. We came in like sort vnto Rat Iland, wherein are so manie
monstrous rats, that if anie horsses, or other beasts, happen to come
thither, or be left there by negligence but one night, they are sure to
be deuoured &amp; eaten vp, without all hope of recouerie. There is
<span class="rightnote">Anwall. Brier.</span>
moreouer the Anwall and the Brier, Ilands in like sort void of all good
furniture, conies onelie excepted, and the Brier (wherein is a village,
castell, and parish-church) bringeth foorth no lesse store of hogs, and
wild foule, than Rat Iland doth of rats, whereof I greatlie maruell.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Rusco.<br />
Inis widd&#333;.</span>
By north of the Brier, lieth the Rusco, which hath a Labell or Byland
stretching out toward the southwest, called Inis widdon. This Rusco is
verie neere so great as that of S. Maries. It hath moreouer an hold, and
a parish within it, beside great store of conies and wild foule, whereof
they make much gaine in due time of the yeare. Next vnto this we come to
<span class="leftnote">Round Iland. S. Lides.</span>
the Round Iland, which is about a mile ouer, then to S. Lides Iland,
(wherein is a parish-church dedicated to that Saint, beside conies,
wood, and wild foule, of which two later there is some indifferent store)
<span class="leftnote">Notho. Auing.</span>
the Notho, the Auing, (one of them being situat by south of another, and
the Auing halfe a mile ouer, which is a iust halfe lesse than the Notho)
<span class="leftnote">Tyan.</span>
and the Tyan, which later is a great Iland, furnished with a
parish-church, and no small plentie of conies as I heare. After the Tyan
<span class="leftnote">S. Martines.</span>
we come to S. Martines Ile, wherein is a faire towne, the Ile it selfe
being next vnto the Rusco for greatnesse, and verie well furnished with
conies &amp; fresh springs. Also betwixt this and S. Maries, are ten other,
smaller, which reach out
<span class="rightnote">Knolworth.<br />
Sniuilliuer.<br />
Menweth&#257;.<br />
Vollis. 1.<br />
Surwihe.<br />
Vollis. 2.<br />
Arthurs Ile.<br />
Guiniliuer.<br />
Nenech.<br />
Gothrois.</span>
of the northeast into the southwest, as Knolworth, Sniuilliuer,
Menwetham, Vollis. 1. Surwihe, Vollis. 2. Arthurs Iland, Guiniliuer,
Nenech and Gothrois, whose estates are diuers: howbeit as no one of
these is to be accounted great in comparison of the other, so they all
yéeld a short grasse méet for sheepe and conies, as doo also the rest.
In the greater Iles likewise (whose names are commonlie such as those of
the townes or churches standing in the same) there are (as I here)
sundry lakes, and those neuer without great plentie of wild foule, so
that the Iles of Sylley, are supposed to be no lesse beneficiall to
their lords, than anie other whatsoeuer, within the compasse of our Ile,
<span class="leftnote">Wild swine in Sylley.</span>
or neere vnto our coasts. In some of them also are wild swine. And as
these Iles are supposed to be a notable safegard to the coast of
Cornewall, so in diuerse of them great store of tin is likewise to be
found. There is in like maner such plentie of fish taken among these
same, that beside the feeding of their swine withall, a man shall haue
more there for a penie, than in London for ten grotes. Howbeit their
cheefe commoditie is made by Keigh, which they drie, cut in peeces, and
carie ouer into little Britaine, where they exchange it there, for salt,
canuas, readie monie, or other merchandize which they doo stand in need
of. A like trade haue some of them also, with Buckhorne or dried
whiting, as I heare. But sith the author of this report did not flatlie
auouch it, I passe ouer that fish as not in season at this time. Thus
haue we viewed the richest and most wealthie Iles of Sylley, from whence
we must direct our course eastwards, vnto the mouth of the Sauerne, and
then go backe againe vnto the west point of Wales, continuing still our
voiage along vpon the west coast of Britaine, till we come to the Soluey
whereat the kingdomes part, &amp; from which foorth on we must touch such
Ilands as lie vpon the west and north shore, till we be come againe vnto
the Scotish sea, and to our owne dominions.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Helenus. Priamus.</span>
From the point of Cornewall therefore, or promontorie of Helenus (so
called, as some thinke, bicause Helenus the son of Priamus who arriued
here with Brute lieth buried there, except the sea haue washed awaie his
sepulchre) vntill we come vnto the mouth of Sauerne, we haue none Ilands
<span class="page"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[Page 61]</span>
at all that I doo know or heare of, but one litle Byland, Cape or
Peninsula, which is not to be counted of in this place. And yet sith I
<span class="rightnote">Pendinas.</span>
haue spoken of it, you shall vnderstand, that it is called Pendinas, and
beside that the compasse thereof is not aboue a mile, this is to be
remembered farder thereof, how there standeth a Pharos or light therein,
for ships which saile by those coasts in the night. There is also at the
verie point of the said Pendinas, a chappell of saint Nicholas, beside
the church of saint Ia, an Irish woman saint. It belonged of late to the
Lord Brooke, but now (as I gesse) the Lord Mountioy enioieth it. There
is also a blockhouse, and a péere in the eastside thereof, but the péere
is sore choked with sand, as is the whole shore furthermore from S. Ies
vnto S. Carantokes, insomuch that the greatest part of this Byland is
now couered with sands, which the sea casteth vp, and this calamitie
hath indured little aboue fiftie yeares, as the inhabitants doo affirme.</p>

<p>There are also two rocks neere vnto Tredwy, and another not farre from
Tintagell, all which many of the common sort doo repute and take for
Iles: wherefore as one desirous to note all, I thinke it not best that
these should be omitted: but to proceed. When we be come further, I
meane vnto the Sauerne mouth, we meet the two Holmes, of which one is
called Stepholme, and the other Flatholme, of their formes béeing in
déed parcels of ground and low soiles fit for little else than to beare
grasse for cattell, whereof they take those names. For Holme is an old
Saxon word, applied to all such places. Of these also Stepholme lieth
south of the Flatholme, about foure or fiue miles; the first also a mile
and an halfe, the other two miles or thereabout in length; but neither
of them a mile and an halfe in breadth, where they doo seeme to be the
broadest.</p>

<p>It should séeme by some that they are not worthie to be placed among
Ilands: yet othersome are of opinion, that they are not altogither so
base, as to be reputed amongst flats or rocks: but whatsoeuer they be,
this is sure, that they oft annoie such passengers and merchants as
passe and repasse vpon that riuer. Neither doo I read of any other Iles
<span class="leftnote">Barri.</span>
which lie by east of these, saue onelie the Barri, and Dunwen: the first
<span class="leftnote">Barri is a flight shot from the shore.</span>
of which is so called of one Barroc, a religious man (as Gyraldus saith)
and is about a flight shot from the shore. Herin also is a rocke
standing at the verie entrance of the cliffe, which hath a little rift
or chine vpon the side, wherevnto if a man doo laie his eare, he shall
heare a noise, as if smithes did worke at the forge, sometimes blowing
with their bellowes, and sometimes striking and clinking with hammers,
whereof manie men haue great wonder; and no maruell. It is about a mile
in compasse, situat ouer against Aberbarry, and hath a chappell in it.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Dunwen.</span>
Dunwen is so called of a church (dedicated to a Welsh woman saint,
called Dunwen) that standeth there. It lieth more than two miles from
Henrosser, right against Neuen, and hath within it two faire mils, &amp;
great store of conies. Certes if the sand increase so fast hereafter as
it hath done of late about it, it will be vnited to the maine within a
short season. Beyond these and toward the coast of southwales lie two
other Ilands, larger in quantitie than the Holmes, of which the one is
<span class="leftnote">Caldee.</span>
called Caldee or Inis Pyr. It hath a parish-church with a spire steeple,
and a pretie towne belonging to the countie of Pembroke, and
iurisdiction of one Dauid in Wales. Leland supposeth the ruines that are
found therein to haue béene of an old priorie sometimes called Lille,
which was a cell belonging to the monasterie of S. Dogmael, but of this
<span class="leftnote">Londy.</span>
I can saie nothing. The other hight Londy, wherein is also a village or
towne, and of this Iland the parson of the said towne is not onelie the
captaine, but hath thereto weife, distresse, and all other commodities
belonging to the same. It is little aboue sixteene miles from the coast
of Wales, though it be thirtie from Caldée, and yet it serueth (as I am
informed) lord and king in Deuonshire. Moreouer in this Iland is great
plentie of sheepe, but more conies, and therewithall of verie fine and
short grasse for their better food &amp; pasturage; likewise much Sampere
vpon the shore, which is carried from thence in barrels. And albeit that
there be not scarslie fourtie housholds in the whole, yet the
inhabitants there with huge stones (alredie prouided) may kéepe off
thousands of their enimies, bicause it is not possible for anie
aduersaries to assaile them, but onelie at one place, and with a most
<span class="page"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[Page 62]</span>
dangerous entrance. In this voiage also we met with two other Ilands,
one of them called Shepes Ile, the other Rat Ile; the first is but a
little plot lieng at the point of the Baie, before we come at the
Blockehouse which standeth north of the same, at the verie entrie into
Milford hauen vpon the eastside. By north also of Shepes Ile, and
betwéene it &amp; Stacke rocke, which lieth in the verie middest of the
hauen, at another point is Rat Ile yet smaller than the former, but what
<span class="leftnote">Schalmey.</span>
commodities are to be found in them as yet I cannot tell. Schalmey the
greater and the lesse lie northwest of Milford hauen a good waie. They
belong both to the crowne, but are not inhabited, bicause they be so
<span class="leftnote">Schoncold.</span>
often spoiled with pirates. Schoncold Ile ioineth vnto great Schalmey,
and is bigger than it, onlie a passage for ships parteth them, whereby
they are supposed to be one: Leland noteth them to lie in Milford hauen.
Beside these also we found the Bateholme, Stockeholme, Midland, and
Gresholme Iles, and then doubling the Wellock point, we came into a
Baie, where we saw saint Brides Iland, and another in the Sound betwéene
Ramsey and the point, of all which Iles and such rocks as are offensiue
to mariners that passe by them, it may be my hap to speake more at large
hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Limen or Ramsey.</span>
Limen (as Ptolomie calleth it) is situat ouer against S. Dauids in Wales
(wherevnto we must néeds come, after we be past another little one,
which some men doo call Gresholme) &amp; lieth directlie west of Schalmey.
In a late map I find this Limen to be called in English Ramsey: Leland
also confirmeth the same, and I cannot learne more thereof, than that it
is much greater than anie of the other last mentioned (sithens I
described the Holmes) and for temporall iurisdiction a member of
Penbrookeshire, as it is vnto S. Dauids for matters concerning the
church. Leland in his commentaries of England lib. 8. saieth that it
contained thrée Ilets, whereof the bishop of S. Dauids is owner of the
greatest, but the chanter of S. Dauids claimeth the second, as the
archdeacon of Cairmarden dooth the third. And in these is verie
excellent pasture for sheepe and horses, but not for other horned beasts
which lacke their vpper téeth by nature (whose substance is conuerted
into the nourishment of their hornes) and therefore cannot bite so low.
<span class="leftnote">Mawr.</span>
Next vnto this Ile we came to Mawr, an Iland in the mouth of Mawr, scant
a bow shoot ouer, and enuironed at the low water with fresh, but at the
high with salt, and here also is excellent catching of herings.</p>

<p>After this, procéeding on still with our course, we fetched a compasse,
going out of the north toward the west, and then turning againe (as the
coast of the countrie leadeth) vntill we sailed full south, leauing the
shore still on our right hand, vntill we came vnto a couple of Iles,
which doo lie vpon the mouth of the Soch, one of them being distant (as
we gessed) a mile from the other, and neither of them of anie greatnesse
almost worthie to be remembred. The first that we came vnto is called
<span class="leftnote">Tudfall.</span>
Tudfall, and therein is a church, but without anie parishioners, except
they be shéepe and conies. The quantitie thereof also is not much aboue
<span class="leftnote">Penthlin.</span>
six acres of ground, measured by the pole. The next is Penthlin, Myrach,
or Mererosse, situat in maner betwixt Tudfall or Tuidall and the shore,
and herein is verie good pasture for horsses, wherof (as I take it) that
<span class="leftnote">Guelyn.</span>
name is giuen vnto it. Next vnto them, we come vnto Gwelyn, a little Ile
which lieth southeast of the fall of Daron or Daren, a thing of small
quantitie, and yet almost parted in the mids by water, and next of all
vnto Bardsey an Iland lieng ouer against Periuincle the southwest point
or promontorie of Northwales (where Merlin Syluestris lieth buried) and
whither the rest of the monks of Bangor did flie to saue themselues,
when 2100. of their fellowes were slaine by the Saxon princes in the
quarell of Augustine the monke, &amp; the citie of Caerleon or Chester raced
to the ground, and not since reedified againe to anie purpose. Ptolomie
calleth this Iland Lymnos, the Britons Enlhi, and therein also is a
parish-church, as the report goeth. From hence we cast about, gathering
still toward the northest, till we came to Caer Ierienrhod, a notable
rocke situat ouer against the mouth of the Leuenni, wherein standeth a
strong hold or fortresse, or else some towne or village. Certes we could
not well discerne whether of both it was, bicause the wind blew hard at
southwest, the morning was mistie, and our
<span class="page"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[Page 63]</span>
mariners doubting some flats to be couched not far from thence, hasted
awaie vnto Anglesei, whither we went a pace with a readie wind euen at
our owne desire.</p>

<p>This Iland (which Tacitus mistaketh no doubt for Mona Cæsaris, and so
dooth Ptolomie as appeareth by his latitudes) is situat about two miles
from the shore of Northwales. Paulus Iouius gesseth that it was in time
<span class="leftnote">Anglesei cut from Wales by working of the sea.</span>
past ioined to the continent, or maine of our Ile, and onelie cut off by
working of the Ocean, as Sicilia peraduenture was from Italie by the
violence of the Leuant or practise of some king that reigned there.
Thereby also (as he saith) the inhabitants were constreind at the first
to make a bridge ouer into the same, till the breach waxed so great,
that no such passage could anie longer be mainteined. But as these
things doo either not touch my purpose at all, or make smallie with the
<span class="leftnote">Anglesei.</span>
present description of this Ile: so (in comming to my matter) Anglesei is
found to be full so great as the Wight, and nothing inferiour, but
rather surmounting it, as that also which Cæsar calleth Mona in
fruitfulnesse of soile by manie an hundred fold. In old time it was
reputed and taken for the common granarie to Wales, as Sicilia was to
Rome and Italie for their prouision of corne. In like maner the Welshmen
themselues called it the mother of their countrie, for giuing their
minds wholie to pasturage, as the most easie and lesse chargeable trade,
they vtterlie neglected tillage, as men that leaned onelie to the
fertilitie of this Iland for their corne, from whence they neuer failed
to receiue continuall abundance. Gyraldus saith that the Ile of Anglesei
was no lesse sufficient to minister graine for the sustentation of all
the men of Wales, than the mountaines called Ereri or Snowdoni in
Northwales were to yeeld plentie of pasture for all the cattell
whatsoeuer within the aforesaid compasse, if they were brought togither
and left vpon the same. It contained moreouer so manie townes welnéere,
as there be daies in a yeare, which some conuerting into Cantreds haue
accompted but for three, as Gyraldus saith. Howbeit as there haue beene
I say 363. townes in Anglesei, so now a great part of that reckoning is
vtterlie shroonke, and so far gone to decaie, that the verie ruines of
them are vnneath to be séene &amp; discerned: and yet it séemeth to be
méetlie well inhabited. Leland noting the smalnesse of our hundreds in
comparison to that they were in time past, addeth (so far as I remember)
that there are six of them in Anglesei, as Menay, Maltraith, Liuon,
Talbellion, Torkalin, and Tindaithin: herevnto Lhoid saith also how it
belonged in old time vnto the kingdome of Guinhed or Northwales, and
that therein at a towne called Aberfraw, being on the southwestside of
the Ile, the kings of Gwinhed held euermore their palaces, whereby it
came to passe, that the kings of Northwales were for a long time called
kings of Aberfraw, as the Welshmen named the kings of England kings of
London, till better instruction did bring them farther knowledge.</p>

<p>There are in Anglesei many townes and villages, whose names as yet I
cannot orderlie atteine vnto: wherefore I will content my selfe with the
rehearsall of so many as we viewed in sailing about the coasts, and
otherwise heard report of by such as I haue talked withall. Beginning
therefore at the mouth of the Gefni (which riseth at northeast aboue
Gefni or Geuenni, 20. miles at the least into the land) we passed first
by Hundwyn, then by Newborow, Port-Hayton, Beaumarrais, Penmon, Elian,
Almwoch, Burric (whereby runneth a rill into a creeke) Cornew, Holihed
(standing in the promontorie) Gwifen, Aberfraw, and Cair Cadwalader, of
all which, the two latter stand as it were in a nuke betweene the
Geuenni water, and the Fraw, wherevpon Aberfraw is situate. Within the
Iland we heard onelie of Gefni afore mentioned, of Gristial standing
vpon the same water, of Tefri, of Lanerchimedh, Lachtenfarwy and
Bodedrin, but of all these the cheefe is now Beaumarais, which was
builded sometime by king Edward the first, and therewithall a strong
castell about the yeare 1295. to kéepe that land in quiet. There are
also as Leland saith 31. parish-churches beside 69. chappels, that is, a
hundreth in all. But héerof I can saie little, for lacke of iust
instruction. In time past, the people of this Ile vsed not to seuerall
their grounds, but now they dig stonie hillocks, and with the stones
thereof they make rude walles, much like to those of Deuonshire, sith
they want hedge bote, fire bote, and house bote, or (to saie at one
word) timber, bushes and trees. As for wine, it is so plentifull and
<span class="page"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[Page 64]</span>
good cheape there most commonlie as in London, through the great
recourse of merchants from France, Spaine, and Italie vnto the aforesaid
Iland. The flesh likewise of such cattell as is bred there, wherof we
haue store yearelie brought vnto Cole faire in Essex is most delicate,
by reason of their excellent pasture, and so much was it esteemed by the
Romans in time past, that Columella did not onelie commend and preferre
them before those of Liguria, but the emperours themselues being neere
hand also caused their prouision to be made for nete out of Anglesei, to
feed vpon at their owne tables as the most excellent beefe. It taketh
now the name of Angles and Ei, which is to meane the Ile of Englismen,
bicause they wan it in the Conquerors time, vnder the leading of Hugh
earle of Chester, and Hugh of Shrewesburie. Howbeit they recouered it
againe in the time of William Rufus, when they spoiled the citie of
Glocester, ransacked Shrewesburie, and returned home with great bootie
and pillage, in which voiage also they were holpen greatlie by the
Irishmen, who after thrée yeares ioined with them againe, and slue the
earle of Shrewesburie (which then liued) with great crueltie. The
Welshmen call it Tiremone and Mon, and herein likewise is a promontorie
<span class="leftnote">Holie head, or Cair kiby.</span>
or Byland, called Holie head (which hath in time past beene named Cair
kyby, of Kyby a monke that dwelled there) from whence the readiest
passage is commonlie had out of Northwales to get ouer into Ireland, of
which Ile I will not speake at this time, least I shuld bereaue another
of that trauell. Yet Plinie saith, lib. 4. cap. 16. that it lieth not
farre off from and ouer against the Silures, which then dwelled vpon the
west coast of our Iland, and euen so farre as Dunbritton, and beyond:
<span class="leftnote">Enilsnach, holie Ile.</span>
but to our Cair kybi. The Britons named it Enylsnach, or holie Ile, of
the number of carcases of holie men, which they affirme to haue beene
buried there. But herein I maruell not a little, wherein women had
offended, that they might not come thither, or at the least wise returne
from thence without some notable reproch or shame vnto their bodies. By
south also of Hilarie point, somewhat inclining toward the east, lieth
Inis Lygod, a small thing (God wot) and therefore not worthie great
remembrance: neuertheles not to be omitted, though nothing else inforced
the memoriall thereof, but onelie the number and certeine tale of such
Iles as lie about our Iland. I might also speake of the Ile Mail Ronyad,
which lieth north west of Anglesei by sixe miles; but bicause the true
name hereof, as of manie riuers and streames are to me vnknowne, I am
the more willing to passe them ouer in silence, least I should be noted
to be farther corrupter of such words as I haue no skill to deliuer and
exhibit in their kind. And now to conclude with the description of the
whole Iland, this I will ad moreouer vnto hir commodities, that as there
are the best milstones of white, red, blew, and gréene gréets,
(especiallie in Tindaithin) so there is great gaines to be gotten by
fishing round about this Ile, if the people there could vse the trade:
but they want both cunning and diligence to take that matter in hand.
And as for temporall regiment, it apperteineth to the countie of
Cairnaruon, so in spirituall cases it belongeth to the bishoprike of
Bangor. This is finallie to be noted of Anglesei, that sundrie earthen
<span class="leftnote">Ancient buriall.</span>
pots are often found there of dead mens bones conuerted into ashes, set
with the mouthes downeward contrarie to the vse of other nations, which
turned the brims vpwards, whereof let this suffice.</p>

<p>Hauing thus described Anglesei, it resteth to report furthermore, how
that in our circuit about the same, we met with other little Ilets, of
which one lieth northwest thereof almost ouer against Butricke mouth, or
the fall of the water, that passeth by Butricke.
<span class="leftnote">Adar.<br />
Moil.<br />
Rhomaid.<br />
Ysterisd.<br />
Adros.<br />
Lygod.</span>
The Britons called it Ynis Ader, that is to say, the Ile of birds in old
time, but now it hight Ynis Moil, or Ynis Rhomaid, that is the Ile of
porpasses. It hath to name likewise Ysterisd, and Adros. Being past
this, we came to the second lieng by north east, ouer against the
Hilarie point, called Ynis Ligod, that is to saie, the Ile of Mise, and
of these two this latter is the smallest, neither of them both being of
<span class="rightnote">Seriall.<br />
Prestholme.</span>
any greatnesse to speake of. Ynis Seriall or Prestholme, lieth ouer
against Penmon, or the point called the head of Mon, where I found a
towne (as I told you) of the same denomination. Ptolomie nameth not this
Iland, whereof I maruell. It is parcell of Flintshire, and of the
iurisdiction of S. Asaph, and in fertilitie of soile, and breed of
cattell, nothing inferiour vnto Anglesei hir mother: although that for
<span class="page"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[Page 65]</span>
quantitie of ground it come infinitelie short thereof, and be nothing
comparable vnto it. The last Iland vpon the cost of Wales, hauing now
<span class="rightnote">Credine.</span>
left Anglesei, is called Credine, and although it lie not properlie
within the compasse of my description, yet I will not let to touch it by
the waie, sith the causey thither from Denbighland, is commonlie
ouerflowne. It is partlie made an Iland by the Conwey, and partlie by
the sea. But to proceed, when we had viewed this place, we passed foorth
to S. Antonies Ile, which is about two or thrée miles compasse or more,
a sandie soile, but yet verie batable for sheepe and cattell, it is well
replenished also with fresh wels, great plentie of wild foule, conies
and quarries of hard ruddie stone, which is oft brought thence to
Westchester, where they make the foundations of their buildings withall.
There are also two parish churches in the same, dedicated to S. Antonie
and S. Iohn, but the people are verie poore, bicause they be so oft
spoiled by pirats, although the lord of the same be verie wealthie
thorough the exchange made with them of his victuals, for their wares,
whereof they make good peniworths, as théeues commonlie doo of such
preies as they get by like escheat, notwithstanding their landing there
is verie dangerous, and onelie at one place. Howbeit they are
constreined to vse it, and there to make their marts. From hence we went
<span class="leftnote">Hilberie.</span>
on, vntill we came to the cape of Ile Brée, or Hilberie, and point of
Wyrale, from whence is a common passage into Ireland, of 18. or 20.
houres sailing, if the wether be not tedious. This Iland at the full sea
is a quarter of a mile from the land, and the streame betwéene foure
fadams déepe, as ship-boies haue oft sounded, but at a lowe water a man
may go ouer thither on the sand. The Ile of it selfe is verie sandie a
mile in compasse, and well stored with conies, thither also went a sort
of supersticious fooles in times past, in pilgrimage, to our ladie of
Hilberie, by whose offerings a cell of monkes there, which belonged to
Chester, was cherished and mainteined.</p>

<p>The next Iland vpon the coast of England is Man or Mona Cæsaris, which
some name Mana or Manim, but after Ptolomie, Monaoida, as some thinke,
though other ascribe that name to Anglesei, which the Welshmen doo
commonlie call Môn, as they doo this Manaw. It is supposed to be the
first, as Hirtha is the last of the Hebrides. Hector Boetius noteth a
difference betwéene them of 300. miles. But Plinie saith that Mona is
200000. miles from Camaldunum, lib. 2. cap. 75. It lieth also vnder 53.
degrées of latitude, and 30. minuts, and hath in longitude 16. degrees
and 40. minuts, abutting on the north side vpon S. Ninians in Scotland,
Furnesfels on the east, Prestholme and Anglesei on the south, and
Vlsther in Ireland on the west. It is greater than Anglesei by a third,
and there are two riuers in the same, whose heads doo ioine so néere,
that they doo seeme in maner to part the Ile in twaine. Some of the
<span class="leftnote">Eubonia.<br />
Meuania.</span>
ancient writers, as Ethicus, &amp;c: call it Eubonia, and other following
Orosius, Meuana or Mæuania, howbeit after Beda and the Scotish
histories, the Meuaniæ are all those Iles aforesaid called the Hebrides,
Eubonides, or Hebudes (whereof William Malmesburie, lib. 1. de regibus
(beside this our Mona) will haue Anglesei also to be one. Wherefore it
séemeth hereby that a number of our late writers ascribing the said name
vnto Mona onelie, haue not beene a little deceiued. Iornandes lib. de
Getis speaketh of a second Meuania; "Habet &amp; aliam Meuaniam (saith he)
necnon &amp; Orchadas." But which should be prima, as yet I do not read,
except it should be Anglesei; and then saith Malmesburie well. In like
sort Propertius speaketh of a Meuania, which he called Nebulosa, but he
meaneth it euidentlie of a little towne in Vmbria where he was borne,
lib. 4. eleg. De vrbe Rom. Wherfore there néedeth no vse of his
authoritie. This in the meane time is euident out of Orosius, lib. 1.
capite 2. that Scots dwelled somtime in this Ile, as also in Ireland,
which Ethicus also affirmeth of his owne time, and finallie confirmeth
that the Scots and Irish were sometime one people. It hath in length 24.
miles, and 8. in bredth, and is in maner of like distance from Galloway
in Scotland, Ireland and Cumberland in England, as Buchanan reporteth.</p>

<p>In this Iland also were some time 1300. families, of which 960. were in
the west halfe, and the rest in the other. But now through ioining house
<span class="page"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[Page 66]</span>
to house &amp; land to land (a common plague and canker, which will eat vp
all, if prouision be not made in time to withstand this mischéefe) that
number is halfe diminished, and yet many of the rich inhabiters want
roome, and wote not how and where to bestowe themselues, to their quiet
contentations. Certes this impediment groweth not by reason that men
were greater in bodie, than they haue béene in time past, but onelie for
that their insatiable desire of inlarging their priuate possessions
increaseth still vpon them, and will doo more, except they be
restrained: but to returne to our purpose. It was once spoiled by the
Scots in the time of king Athelstane, chéeflie by Anlafus in his flight
from the bloudie battell, wherein Constantine king of Scotland was
ouercome: secondlie by the Scots 1388. after it came to the possession
of the English, for in the beginning the kings of Scotland had this
Iland vnder their dominion, almost from their first arriuall in this
Iland, and as Beda saith till Edwine king of the Northumbers wan it from
them, and vnited it to his kingdome. After the time of Edwine, the Scots
gat the possession thereof againe, and held it till the Danes &amp; Norwaies
wan it from them, who also kept it (but with much trouble) almost 370.
yeares vnder the gouernance of their viceroies, whome the kings of
Norwaie inuested vnto that honor, till Alexander the third king of that
name in Scotland recouered it from them, with all the rest of those Iles
that lie vpon the west coast, called also Sodorenses in the daies of
Magnus king of Norwaie. And sithens that time the Scotish princes haue
not ceased to giue lawes to such as dwelled there, but also from time to
time appointed such bishops as should exercise ecclesiasticall
iurisdiction in the same, till it was won from them by our princes, and
<span class="leftnote"><em>Chronica Tinemuthi.</em></span>
so vnited vnto the realme of England. Finallie, how after sundrie sales
bargains and contracts of matrimonie (for I read that William Scroope
the kings Vicechamberleine, did buy this Ile and crowne thereof of the
lord William Montacute earle of Sarum) it came vnto the ancestours of
the earles of Darbie, who haue béene commonlie said to be kings of Man,
the discourse folowing shall more at large declare. Giraldus noteth a
contention betwéene the kings of England &amp; Ireland for the right of this
Iland, but in the end, when by a comprimise the triall of the matter was
referred to the liues or deaths of such venemous wormes as should be
brought into the same, and it was found that they died not at all, as
the like doo in Ireland, sentence passed with the king of England, &amp; so
he reteined the Iland. But howsoeuer this matter standeth, and whether
anie such thing was done at all or not, sure it is that the people of
the said Ile were much giuen to witchcraft and sorcerie (which they
learned of the Scots a nation greatlie bent to that horrible practise)
in somuch that their women would oftentimes sell wind to the mariners,
inclosed vnder certeine knots of thred, with this iniunction, that they
which bought the same, should for a great gale vndoo manie, and for the
<span class="leftnote">Tall men in Man.</span>
lesse a fewer or smaller number. The stature of the men and also
fertilitie of this Iland are much commended, and for the latter supposed
verie néere to be equall with that of Anglesei, in all commodities.</p>

<p>There are also these townes therein, as they come now to my remembrance,
Rushen, Dunglasse, Holme towne, S. Brids, Bala cury (the bishops house)
S. Mich. S. Andrew, kirk Christ, kirk Louel, S. Mathees, kirk S. Anne,
Pala sala, kirk S. Marie, kirk Concane, kirk Malu, and Home. But of all
these Rushen with the castell is the strongest. It is also in recompense
<span class="leftnote">Riuers.</span>
of the common want of wood, indued with sundrie pretie waters, as first
of al the Burne rising in the northside of Warehill botoms, and
branching out by southwest of kirk S. An, it séemeth to cut off a great
part of the eastside thereof, from the residue of that Iland. From those
hils also (but of the south halfe) commeth the Holme and Holmey, by a
towne of the same name, in the verie mouth whereof lieth the Pile afore
mentioned. They haue also the Bala passing by Bala cury, on the
westside, and the Rame on the north, whose fall is named Ramesei hauen,
as I doo read in Chronicles.</p>
<p>
There are moreouer sundrie great hils therein,<span class="rightnote">Hilles.</span>
as that wherevpon S.
Mathees standeth, in the northeast part of the Ile, a parcell whereof
commeth flat south, betwéene kirk Louell, and kirk Marie, yéelding out
of their botoms the water Bala, whereof I spake before. Beside these and
<span class="page"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[Page 67]</span>
well toward the south part of the Ile, I find the Warehils, which are
extended almost from the west coast ouertwhart vnto the Burne streame.
<span class="rightnote">Hauens.</span>
It hath also sundrie hauens, as Ramsei hauen, by north Laxam hauen, by
east Port Iris, by southwest Port Home, and Port Michell, by west. In
<span class="leftnote">Calfe of man.<br />
The pile.<br />
S. Michels Ile.</span>
like sort there are diuers Ilets annexed to the same, as the Calfe of
man on the south, the Pile on the west, and finallie S. Michels Ile
<span class="rightnote">Sheepe.</span>
in the gulfe called Ranoths waie in the east. Moreouer the sheepe of
this countrie are excéeding huge, well woolled, and their tailes of such
<span class="rightnote">Hogs.</span>
greatnesse as is almost incredible. In like sort their hogs are in maner
<span class="leftnote"><br />Barnacles.</span>
monstrous. They haue furthermore great store of barnacles bréeding vpon
their coasts, but yet not so great store as in Ireland, and those (as
there also) of old ships, ores, masts, peeces of rotten timber as they
saie, and such putrified pitched stuffe, as by wrecke hath happened to
corrupt vpon that shore. Howbeit neither the inhabitants of this Ile,
<span class="leftnote">Barnacles neither fish nor flesh.</span>
nor yet of Ireland can readilie saie whether they be fish or flesh, for
although the religious there vsed to eat them as fish, yet elsewhere,
some haue beene troubled, for eating of them in times prohibited for
heretikes and lollards.</p>

<p>For my part, I haue béene verie desirous to vnderstand the vttermost of
the bréeding of barnacls, &amp; questioned with diuers persons about the
same. I haue red also whatsoeuer is written by forren authors touching
the generation of that foule, &amp; sought out some places where I haue
béene assured to sée great numbers of them: but in vaine. Wherefore I
vtterlie despaired to obteine my purpose, till this present yeare of
Grace 1584. and moneth of Maie, wherein going to the court at Gréenewich
from London by bote, I saw sundrie ships lieng in the Thames newlie come
home, either from Barbarie or the Canarie Iles (for I doo not well
remember now from which of these places) on whose sides I perceiued an
infinit sort of shells to hang so thicke as could be one by another.
Drawing néere also, I tooke off ten or twelue of the greatest of them, &amp;
afterward hauing opened them, I saw the proportion of a foule in one of
them more perfectlie than in all the rest, sauing that the head was not
yet formed, bicause the fresh water had killed them all (as I take it)
and thereby hindered their perfection. Certeinelie the feathers of the
taile hoeng out of the shell at least two inches, the wings (almost
perfect touching forme) were garded with two shels or shéeldes
proportioned like the selfe wings, and likewise the brestbone had hir
couerture also of like shellie substance, and altogither resembling the
figure which Lobell and Pena doo giue foorth in their description of
this foule: so that I am now fullie persuaded that it is either the
barnacle that is ingendred after one maner in these shels, or some other
sea-foule to vs as yet vnknowen. For by the feathers appearing and forme
so apparant, it cannot be denied, but that some bird or other must
proceed of this substance, which by falling from the sides of the ships
in long voiages, may come to some perfection. But now it is time for me
to returne againe vnto my former purpose.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bishop of Man.</span>
There hath sometime beene, and yet is a bishop of this Ile, who at the
first was called Episcopus Sodorensis, when the iurisdiction of all the
Hebrides belonged vnto him. Whereas now he that is bishop there, is but
a bishops shadow, for albeit that he beare the name of bishop of Man,
yet haue the earles of Darbie, as it is supposed, the cheefe profit of
his sée (sauing that they allow him a little somewhat for a flourish)
<span class="leftnote">Patrone of Man.</span>
notwithstanding that they be his patrons, and haue his nomination vnto
that liuing. The first bishop of this Ile was called Wimundus or
Raymundus, and surnamed Monachus Sauinensis, who by reason of his
extreame and tyrannicall crueltie toward the Ilanders, had first his
sight taken from him, &amp; then was sent into exile. After him succéeded
another moonke in king Stephens daies called Iohn, and after him one
Marcus, &amp;c: other after other in succession, the sée it selfe being now
also subiect to the archbishop of Yorke for spirituall iurisdiction.
<span class="leftnote">King of Man.</span>
In time of Henrie the second, this Iland also had a king, whose name was
Cuthred, vnto whome Vinianus the cardinall came as legate 1177. and
wherin Houeden erreth not. In the yeare also 1228. one Reginald was
viceroy or petie king of Man, afterward murthered by his subiects. Then
Olauus, after him Hosbach the sonne of Osmond Hacon, 1290. who being
slaine, Olauus and Gotredus parted this kingdome of Sodora, in such
<span class="page"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[Page 68]</span>
wise, that this had all the rest of the Iles, the other onelie the Ile
of Man at the first; but after the slaughter of Gotredus, Olauus held
all, after whom Olauus his sonne succeeded. Then Harald sonne to Olauus,
who being entered in Maie, and drowned vpon the coastes of Ireland, his
brother Reginald reigned twentie and seuen daies, and then was killed
the first of June, whereby Olauus aliàs Harald sonne to Gotred ruled in
the Ile one yeare. Next vnto him succéeded Magnus the second sonne of
Olauus, and last of all Iuarus, who held it so long as the Norwaies were
lords thereof. But being once come into the hands of the Scots, one
Godred Mac Mares was made lieutenant, then Alane, thirdlie Maurice
Okarefer, and fourthlie one of the kings chapleines, &amp;c. I would gladlie
haue set downe the whole catalog of all the viceroyes and lieutenants:
but sith I can neither come by their names nor successions, I surcesse
to speake any more of them, and also of the Ile it selfe, whereof this
may suffice.</p>

<p>After we haue in this wise described the Ile of Man, with hir
commodities, we returned eastwards backe againe unto the point of
Ramshed, where we found to the number of six Ilets of one sort and
other, whereof the first greatest and most southwesterlie, is named
<span class="leftnote">Wauay.</span>
the Wauay. It runneth out in length, as we gessed, about fiue miles and
more from the southeast into the northwest, betwéene which and the maine
land lie two little ones, whose names are Oldborrow and Fowlney. The
<span class="rightnote">Fouldra.</span>
fourth is called the Fouldra, and being situate southeast of the first,
it hath a prettie pile or blockhouse therin, which the inhabitants name
<span class="leftnote">Fola.<br />
Roa.</span>
the pile of Fouldra. By east thereof in like sort lie the Fola and the
Roa, plots of no great compasse, and yet of all these six, the first and
Fouldra are the fairest and most fruitfull. From hence we went by
<span class="rightnote">Rauenglasse.</span>
Rauenglasse point, where lieth an Iland of the same denomination, as
Reginald Wolfe hath noted in his great card, not yet finished, nor
likelie to be published. He noteth also two other Ilets, betwéene the
same and the maine land; but Leland speaketh nothing of them (to my
remembrance) neither any other card, as yet set foorth of England: and
thus much of the Ilands that lie vpon our shore in this part of my
voiage.</p>

<p>Hauing so exactlie as to me is possible, set downe the names and
positions of such Iles, as are to be found vpon the coast of the Quéenes
Maiesties dominions, now it resteth that we procéed orderlie with those
<span class="leftnote">Iles in Scotland.</span>
that are séene to lie vpon the coast of Scotland, that is to saie, in
the Irish, the Deucalidonian &amp; the Germans seas, which I will performe
in such order as I may, sith I cannot do so much therin as I would. Some
therefore doo comprehend and diuide all the Iles that lie about the
north coast of this Ile now called Scotland into thrée parts, sauing
that they are either occidentals, the west Iles, aliàs the Orchades &amp;
Zelandine, or the Shetlands. They place the first betwéene Ireland and
the Orchades, so that they are extended from Man and the point of
Cantire almost vnto the Orchades in the Deucalidonian sea, and after
some are called the Hebrides. In this part the old writers indéed placed
<span class="leftnote">Hemodes of some called Acmodes, sée <em>Plinie, Mela, Martianus,
Capella, Plutarch. de defect. orac.</em></span>the Hebrides or Hemodes, which diuers
call the Hebudes and the Acmodes; albeit the writers varie in their
numbers, some speaking of 30 Hebudes and seuen Hemodes; some of fiue
Ebudes, as Solinus, and such as follow his authoritie. Howbeit the late
Scottish writers doo product a summe of more than 300 of these Ilands in
all, which sometime belonged to the Scots, sometime to the Norwegians,
and sometime to the Danes. The first of these is our Manaw, of which I
haue before intreated: next vnto this is Alisa a desert Ile, yet
replenished with conies, soland foule, and a fit harbor for fishermen
that in time of the yeare lie vpon the coast thereof for herings. Next
vnto this is the Arran, a verie hillie and craggie soile, yet verie
plentifull of fish all about the coast, and wherein is a verie good
hauen: ouer against the mouth whereof lieth the Moll, which is also no
small defence to such seafaring men as seeke harbor in that part. Then
came we by the Fladwa or Pladwa, no lesse fruitfull and stored with
conies than the Bota, Bura, or Botha, of eight miles long &amp; foure miles
broad, a low ground but yet verie batable, and wherein is good store of
short and indifferent pasture: it hath also a towne there called Rosse,
and a castell named the Camps. There is also another called the Marnech,
<span class="page"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[Page 69]</span>
an Iland of a mile in length, and halfe a mile in breadth, low ground
also but yet verie fertile. In the mouth likewise of the Glot, lieth the
more Cumber and the lesse, not farre in sunder one from another, and
both fruitfull inough the one for corne, and the other for Platyceraton.
The Auon another Iland lieth about a mile from Cantire, and is verie
commodious to ships, wherof it is called Auon, that is to saie,
Portuosa, or full of harbor: and therefore the Danes had in time past
great vse of it. Then haue we the Raclind, the Kyntar, the Cray, the
Gegaw six miles in length and a mile and a halfe in breadth; the Dera
full of déere, and not otherwise vnfruitfull: and therefore some thinke
<span class="leftnote">Scarba.</span>
that it was called the Ile of déere in old time. Scarba foure miles in
length, and one in breadth, verie little inhabited, and thereinto the
sea betwéene that and the Ile of déere is so swift and violent, that
except it be at certeine times, it is not easilie nauigable. Being past
these, we come to certeine Ilands of no great fame, which lie scattered
here and there, as Bellach, Gyrastell, Longaie, both the Fiolas, the
thrée Yarues, Culbrenin, Duncomell, Lupar, Belnaua, Wikerua, Calfile,
Luing, Sele Ile, Sound, of which the last thrée are fruitfull, and
<span class="leftnote">Slate Ile.</span>
belong to the earle of Argile. Then haue we the Slate, so called of the
tiles that are made therin. The Nagsey, Isdalf, and the Sken (which
later is also called Thian, of a wicked herbe growing there greatlie
hurtfull, and in colour not much vnlike the lillie, sauing that it is of
a more wan and féeble colour) Vderga, kings Ile, Duffa or blacke Ile,
Kirke Ile and Triarach. There is also the Ile Ard, Humble Ile, Greene
Ile, and Heth Ile, Arbor Ile, Gote Ile, Conies Ile aliàs idle Ile, Abrid
Ile or bird Ile, and Lismor, wherein the bishop of Argill sometime held
his palace, being eight miles in length and two miles in breadth, and
not without some mines also of good mettall. There is also the Ile
Ouilia, Siuna, Trect, Shepey, Fladaw, Stone Ile, Gresse, great Ile,
Ardis, Musadell, &amp; Berner, sometime called the holie sanctuarie, Vghe
Ile, Molochasgyr, and Drinacha, now ouergrowne with bushes, elders, and
vtterlie spoiled by the ruines of such great houses as haue heretofore
béene found therin. There is in like sort the Wijc, the Ranse, and the
Caruer.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Ila.</span>
In this tract also, there are yet thrée to intreat of, as Ila, Mula and
Iona, of which the first is one of the most, that hath not béene least
accounted of. It is not much aboue 24 miles in length, and in breadth 16
reaching from the south into the north, and yet it is an excéeding rich
plot of ground verie plentious of corne, cattell, déere, and also lead,
and other mettals, which were easie to be obteined, if either the people
were industrious, or the soile yéeldable of wood to fine and trie out
the same. In this Iland also there is a lake of swéet water called the
Laie, and also a baie wherein are sundrie Ilands; and therevnto another
lake of fresh water, wherein the Falangam Ile is situate, wherein the
souereigne of all the Iles sometime dwelled. Néere vnto this is the
<span class="leftnote">Round Ile.</span>
round Ile, so called of the consultations there had: for there was a
court sometime holden, wherein 14 of the principall inhabitants did
minister iustice vnto the rest, and had the whole disposition of things
committed vnto them, which might rule vnto the benefit of those Ilands.
There is also the Stoneheape, an other Iland so called of the heape of
stones that is therein. On the south side also of Ila, we find moreouer
the Colurne, Mulmor, Osrin, Brigidan, Corkerke, Humble Ile, Imersga,
Bethy, Texa, Shepeie, Naosig, Rinard, Cane, Tharscher, Aknor, Gret Ile,
Man Ile, S. Iohns Ile, and Stackbed. On the west side thereof also lieth
Ouersey, whereby runneth a perilous sea, and not nauigable, but at
certeine houres, Merchant Ile, Vsabrast, Tanask, Neff, Wauer Ile,
Oruans, Hog Ile, and Colauanso.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Mula.</span>
Mula is a right noble Ile, 24 miles in length and so manie in bredth,
rough of soile, yet fruitfull enough: beside woods, déere, &amp; good
harbrough for ships, replenished with diuers and sundrie townes and
castels. Ouer against Columkill also, it hath two riuers, which yeld
verie great store of salmons, and other riuellets now altogither
vnfruitfull, beside two lakes, in each of which is an Iland: and
likewise in euerie of these Ilands a castell. The sea beating vpon this
Ile, maketh foure notable baies wherein great plentie and verie good
herrings are taken. It hath also in the northwest side Columbria, or the
<span class="page"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[Page 70]</span>
Ile of doues; on the southeast, Era: both verie commodious for fishing,
cattell, and corne. Moreouer, this is woorth the noting in this Ile
aboue all the rest, that it hath a plesant spring, arising two miles in
distance from the shore, wherein are certeine little egs found, much
like vnto indifferent pearles, both for colour and brightnesse, and
thereto full of thicke humour, which egs being carried by violence of
the fresh water vnto the salt, are there within the space of twelue
houres conuerted into great shels, which I take to be mother pearle;
except I be deceiued.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Iona.</span>
Iona was sometime called Columkill, in fame and estimation nothing
inferiour to anie of the other, although in length it excéed little
aboue two miles, and in breadth one. Certes it is verie fruitfull of all
such commodities, as that climat wherein it standeth dooth yeeld, and
beareth the name of Columbus the abbat, of whome I haue spoken more at
large in my Chronologie. There were somtimes also two monasteries
therein, one of moonks builded by Fergus, another of nuns: and a parish
church, beside many chappels builded by the Scotish kings, and such
princes as gouerned in the Iles. And when the English had once gotten
possession of the Ile of Manaw, a bishops see was erected in the old
monasterie of Columbus, whereby the iurisdiction of those Iles was still
mainteined and continued. Certes there remaine yet in this Iland the old
burials apperteining to the most noble families that had dwelled in the
west Iles; but thrée aboue other are accompted the most notable, which
haue little houses builded vpon them. That in the middest hath a stone,
<span class="leftnote">Regum tumuli.</span>
whereon is written, Tumuli regum Scotiæ, The burials of the kings of
Scotland: for (as they saie) fourtie eight of them were there interred.
Another is intituled with these words, The burials of the kings of
Ireland, bicause foure of them lie in that place. The third hath these
words written thereon, The graues of the kings of Norwaie, for there
eight of them were buried also, and all through a fond suspicion
conceiued of the merits of Columbus. Howbeit in processe of time, when
Malcolme Cammor had erected his abbeie at Donfermeling, he gaue occasion
to manie of his successors to be interred there.</p>

<p>About this Iland there lie six other Iles dispersed, small in quantitie,
but not altogither barren, sometimes giuen by the kings of Scotland and
lords of the Iles vnto the abbeie of saint Columbus, of which the Soa,
albeit that it yeeld competent pasturage for shéepe, yet is it more
commodious, by such egs as the great plentie of wildfoule there bréeding
doo <span class="leftnote">The Ile of Shrewes.</span> laie within the same. Then is there
the Ile of Shrewes or of women; as the more sober heads doo call it.
Also Rudan, &amp; next vnto that, the Rering. There is also the Shen halfe a
mile from Mula, whose bankes doo swarme with conies: it hath also a
parish church, but most of the inhabitants doo liue and dwell in Mula.
There is also the Eorse or the Arse, and all these belong vnto saint
Columbus abbeie. Two miles from Arse is the Olue, an Iland fiue miles in
length, and sufficientlie stored with corne and grasse, &amp; not without a
good hauen for ships to lie and harbor in. There is also the Colfans, an
iland fruitfull inough, and full of cornell trées. There is not far off
<span class="leftnote">Mosse Ile.</span>
also the Gomater, Stafa, the two Kerneburgs, and the Mosse Ile, in the
old Brittish speech called Monad, that is to saie Mosse. The soile of it
is verie blacke, bicause of the corruption &amp; putrefaction of such woods
as haue rotted thereon: wherevpon also no small plentie of mosse is bred
and ingendered. The people in like maner make their fire of the said
earth, which is fullie so good as our English turffe. There is also the
Long, &amp; six miles further toward the west, Tirreie, which is eight miles
in length and thrée in breadth, &amp; of all other one of the most
plentifull for all kinds of commodities: for it beareth corne, cattell,
fish, and seafowle aboundantlie. It hath also a well of fresh water, a
castell, and a verie good hauen for great vessels to lie at safegard in.
Two miles from this also is the Gun, and the Coll two miles also from
the Gun. Then passed we by the Calfe, a verie wooddie Iland, the foure
gréene Iles, the two glasse or skie Ilands, the Ardan, the Ile of
woolfes, &amp; then the great Iland which reacheth from the east into the
west, is sixteene miles in length, and six in breadth, full of mounteins
and swelling woods: and for asmuch as it is not much inhabited, the
seafoules laie great plentie of egs there, whereof such as will, may
<span class="page"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[Page 71]</span>
gather what number them listeth. Vpon the high cliffes and rocks also the
Soland géese are taken verie plentifullie. Beyond this, about foure
miles also is the Ile of horsses: and a little from that the hog Iland,
which is not altogither vnfruitfull. There is a falcon which of custome
bréedeth there, and therevnto it is not without a conuenient hauen. Not
farre off also is the Canna, and the Egga, little Iles, but the later
full of Soland géese. Likewise the Sobratill, more apt to hunt in than
méet for anie other commoditie that is to be reaped thereby.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Skie.</span>
After this we came to the Skie, the greatest Ile about all Scotland: for
it is two and fortie miles long; and somewhere eight, &amp; in some places
twelue miles broad: it is moreouer verie hillie, which hilles are
therevnto loaden with great store of wood, as the woods are with
pasture, the fields with corne and cattell; and (besides all other
commodities) with no small heards of mares, whereby they raise great
aduantage and commoditie. It hath fiue riuers verie much abounding with
salmons, and other fresh streams not altogither void of that prouision.
It is inuironed also with manie baies, wherein great plentie of herrings
is taken in time of the yéere. It hath also a noble poole of fresh
water; fiue castels and sundrie townes; as Aie, S. Iohns, Dunwegen, S.
Nicholas, &amp;c. The old Scots called it Skianacha, that is, Winged, but
now named Skie. There lie certeine small Ilands about this also, as
Rausa a batable soile for corne &amp; gras; Conie Iland full of woods and
conies; Paba a theeuish Iland, in whose woods théeues do lurke to rob
such as passe by them. Scalpe Ile, which is full of deere; Crowling,
wherein is verie good harbour for ships; Rarsa, full of béechen woods
and stags, being in length seuen miles, and two in breadth. The Ron, a
woodie Ile and full of heath: yet hath it a good hauen, which hath a
little Iland called Gerloch on the mouth thereof, and therein lurke
manie théeues. There is not farre off from this Ron, to wit about six
miles also, the Flad, the Tiulmen, Oransa, Buie the lesse, and Buie the
more and fiue other little trifling Iles, of whose names I haue no
notice.</p>

<p>After these we come vnto the Ise, a pretie fertile Iland, to the Oue, to
the Askoome, to the Lindill. And foure score miles from the Skie towards
the west, to the Ling, the Gigarmen, the Berner, the Magle, the Pable,
the Flad, the Scarpe, the Sander, the Vateras, which later hath a noble
hauen for great ships, beside sundrie other commodities: and these nine
last rehearsed are vnder the dominion of the bishop of the Iles. After
<span class="leftnote">Bar.</span>
this we come to the Bar, an Iland seauen miles in length, not
vnfruitfull for grasse and corne, but the chiefe commoditie thereof
lieth by taking of herrings, which are there to be had abundantlie. In
one baie of this Iland there lieth an Islet, and therein standeth a
strong castell. In the north part hereof also is an hill which beareth
good grasse from the foot to the top, and out of that riseth a spring,
which running to the sea, doth carrie withall a kind of creature not yet
perfectlie formed, which some do liken vnto cockels; and vpon the shore
where the water falleth into the sea, they take vp a kind of shelfish,
when the water is gone, which they suppose to be ingendred or increased
after this manner. Betwéene the Barre and the Visse lie also these
Ilands, Orbaus, Oue, Hakerset, Warlang, Flad, the two Baies, Haie,
Helsaie, Gigaie, Lingaie, Fraie, Fudaie, and Friskaie. The Visse is
thirtie miles long and six miles broad; and therein are sundrie fresh
waters, but one especiallie of three miles in length: neuerthelesse, the
sea hath now of late found a waie into it, so that it cannot be kept off
with a banke of three score foot, but now and then it will flowe into
the same, and leaue sea-fish behind it in the lake. There is also a fish
bred therein almost like vnto a salmon, sauing that it hath a white
bellie, a blacke backe, and is altogither without scales: it is likewise
a great harbour for théeues and pirats.</p>

<p>Eight miles beyond this lieth the Helscher, appertinent to the nuns of
Iona: then haue we the Hasker, verie plentifullie benefited by seales,
which are there taken in time of the yéere. Thrée score miles from this
also is the Hirth, whose inhabitants are rude in all good science and
religion; yet is the Iland verie fruitfull in all things, and bringeth
foorth shéepe farre greater than are else-where to be found, for they
are as big as our fallow deare, horned like bugles, and haue their
tailes hanging to the ground. He that is owner of this Ile, sendeth ouer
<span class="page"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[Page 72]</span>
his bailiffe into the same at midsummer, to gather in his duties, and
<span class="rightnote">Baptisme without preests.</span>
with him a préest to saie masse, and to baptise all the children borne
since that time of the yéere precedent: or if none will go ouer with him
(bicause the voiage is dangerous) then doth each father take paine to
baptise his owne at home. Their rents are paid commonlie in dried seales
and sea foule. All the whole Ile is not aboue a mile euerie waie; and
except thrée mounteines that lie vpon one part of the shore, such as
dwell in the other Iles can see no part thereof.</p>

<p>Being past the Visse, we came after to Walaie, the Soa, the Strome, to
Pabaie, to Barner, Ensaie, Killiger, the two Sagas, the Hermodraie,
Scarfe, Grie, Ling, Gilling, Heie, Hoie, Farlaie, great So, little So,
Ise, Sein the more, Sein the lesse, Tarant, Slegan, Tuom, Scarpe,
Hareie, and the seauen holie Ilands, which are desert and bréed nothing
<span class="leftnote">Wild sheepe.</span>
but a kind of wild shéepe, which are often hunted, but seldome or neuer
eaten. For in stéed of flesh they haue nothing but tallow; and if anie
flesh be, it is so vnsauorie, that few men care to eate of it, except
great hunger compell them. I suppose, that these be the wild sheepe
which will not be tamed; and bicause of the horrible grenning thereof,
<span class="leftnote">Tigers.</span>
is taken for the bastard tiger. Their haire is betweene the wooll of a
sheepe, and the haire of a goat, resembling both, shacked, and yet
absolutelie like vnto neither of both: it maie be also the same beast
which Capitolinus calleth Ouis fera, shewed in the time of Gordian the
emperour; albeit that some take the same for the Camelopardalis: but
hereof I make no warrantise.</p>

<p>There is also not farre off the Garuell, the Lambe, the Flad, the
Kellas, the two Bernars, the Kirt, the two Buies, the Viraie, the
<span class="leftnote">Ile of Pigmeies.</span>
Pabaie, the two Sigrams, and the Ile of Pigmeies (which is so called
vpon some probable coniecture) for manie little sculs and bones are
dailie there found déepe in the ground, perfectlie resembling the bodies
of children; &amp; not anie of greater quantities, wherby their coniecture
(in their opinion) is the more likelie to be true. There is also the
Fabill Ile, Adams Ile, the Ile of Lambes, Hulmes, Viccoll, Haueraie,
Car, Era, Columbes Ile, Tor Ile, Iffurd, Scalpe, Flad, and the Swet; on
whose east side is a certeine vault or caue, arched ouer, a flight shoot
in length, wherevnto meane ships do vse to runne for harbour with full
saile when a tempest ouertaketh them, or the raging of the sea, in those
parts do put them in danger of wrecke. Also we passed by the old castell
Ile, which is a pretie and verie commodious plat for fish, foule, egges,
corne, and pasture. There is also the Ile Eust or Eu, which is full of
wood, and a notable harbour for théeues, as is also the Grinort;
likewise the preests Ile, which is verie full of sea foule and good
pasture. The Afull, the two Herbrerts, to wit, the greater and the
lesse; and the Iles of Horsses, and Mertaika: and these 8 lie ouer
against the baie which is called the Lake Brian. After this, we go
toward the north, and come to the Haraie, and the Lewis or the Leug,
both which make (in truth) but one Iland of thrée score miles in length,
and sixtéene in breadth, being distinguished by no water, but by huge
woods, bounds, and limits of the two owners that doo possesse those
parts. The south part is called Haraie, <span class="leftnote">Lewis called Thule by
Tacitus, with no better authoritie than the Angleseie Mona.</span> and the
whole situate in the Deucalidon sea, ouer against the Rosse, &amp; called
Thule by Tacitus, wherein are manie lakes, and verie pretie villages, as
lake Erwijn, lake Vnsalsago: but of townes, S. Clements, Stoie, Nois, S.
Columbane, Radmach, &amp;c. In like sort, there are two churches, whereof
one is dedicated to saint Peter, an other to S. Clement, beside a
monasterie called Roadill. The soile also of this Ile is indifferent
fruitfull; but they reape more profit vnder the ground than aboue, by
digging. There is neither woolfe, fox, nor serpent séene in this Iland;
yet are there great woods therein, which also separate one part from the
other. Likewise there be plentie of stags, but farre lesse in quantitie
than ours: and in the north part of the Iland also is a riuer which
greatlie aboundeth with salmons. That part also called Lewisa, which is
the north half of the Ile is well inhabited toward the sea coasts, and
hath riuers no lesse plentifull for salmon than the other halfe. There
is also great store of herrings taken, whereof the fisher men doo raise
great gaine and commoditie; and no lesse plentie of sheepe, which they
<span class="page"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[Page 73]</span>
doo not sheere, but plucke euerie yeere; yet is the ground of this part
verie heathie, and full of mosse, and the face thereof verie swart and
blacke, for the space of a foot in depth, through the corruption of such
woods as in time past haue rotted on the same. And therefore in time of
the yeere they conuert it into turffe to burne, as néede shall serue;
and in the yéere after, hauing well doonged it in the meane time with
slawke of the sea, they sowe barleie in the selfe places where the
turffes grew, and reape verie good corne, wherewith they liue and féed.
<span class="leftnote">Tithe whales.</span>
Such plentie of whales also are taken in this coast, that the verie
tithe hath béene knowne, in some one yéere, to amount vnto seauen and
twentie whales of one greatnesse and other. This is notable also in this
part of the Ile, that there is a great caue two yards déepe of water
when the sea is gone, and not aboue foure when it is at the highest;
ouer which great numbers doo sit of both sexes and ages, with hooks and
lines, and catch at all times an infinite deale of fish, wherewith they
liue, and which maketh them also the more idle.</p>

<p>Being past this about sixtie miles, we come vnto the Rona, or Ron, which
some take for the last of the Hebrides, distant (as I said) about fortie
miles from the Orchades, and one hundreth and thirtie from the
promontorie of Dungisbe. The inhabitants of this Ile are verie rude and
irreligious, the lord also of the soile dooth limit their number of
housholds, &amp; hauing assigned vnto them what numbers of the greater and
smaller sorts of cattell they shall spend and inioie for their owne
prouision, they send the ouerplus yéerlie vnto him to Lewis. Their
cheefe paiments consist of a great quantitie of meale, which is verie
plentifull among them, sowed vp in shéepes skins. Also of mutton and sea
foule dried, that resteth ouer and aboue, which they themselues do
spend. And if it happen that there be more people in the Iland than the
lords booke or rate dooth come vnto, then they send also the ouerplus of
them in like maner vnto him: by which means they liue alwaies in
plentie. They receiue no vices from strange countries, neither know or
heare of anie things doone else-where than in their owne Iland. Manie
whales are taken also vpon their coasts, which are likewise replenished
with seale, and porpasse, and those which are either so tame, or so
fierce, that they abash not at the sight of such as looke vpon them,
neither make they anie hast to flie out of their presence.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Suilscraie.</span>
Beyond this Ile, about 16 miles westward, there is another called
Suilscraie, of a mile length, void of grasse, and without so much as
heath growing vpon hir soile: yet are there manie cliffes and rocks
therein, which are couered with blacke mosse, whereon innumerable sorts
of foules do bréed and laie their egs. Thither in like sort manie doo
saile from Lewissa, to take them yoong in time of the yeare, before they
be able to flie, which they also kill and drie in eight daies space, and
then returne home againe with them, and great plentie of fethers
gathered in this voiage. One thing is verie strange and to be noted in
<span class="leftnote">Colke foule.</span>
this Iland, of the Colke foule, which is little lesse than a goose; and
this kind commeth thither but once in the yeare, to wit, in the spring,
to laie hir egs and bring vp hir yoong, till they be able to shift for
themselues, &amp; then they get them awaie togither to the sea, and come no
more vntill that time of the yéere which next insueth. At the same
season also they cast their fethers there, as it were answering tribute
to nature for the vse of hir mossie soile: wherein it is woonderfull to
sée, that those fethers haue no stalkes, neither anie thing that is hard
in them, but are séene to couer their bodies as it were wooll or downe,
till breeding time (I saie) wherein they be left starke naked.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Orchades.</span>
The Orchades (whose first inhabitants were the Scithians, which came
from those Iles where the Gothes did inhabit, as some sparks yet
remaining among them of that language doo declare) lie partlie in the
Germaine, and partlie in the Calidon seas, ouer against the point of
Dunghisbie (being in number eight and twentie, or as other saie thirtie
&amp; one, yet some saie thirtie thrée, as Orosius, but Plinie saith fortie)
and now belonging to the crowne of Scotland, as are the rest whereof
héeretofore I haue made report, since we crossed ouer the mouth of the
Solueie streame, to come into this countrie. Certes the people of these
Islands reteine much of their old sparing diets, and therevnto they are
of goodlie stature, tall, verie comelie, healthfull, of long life, great
<span class="page"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[Page 74]</span>
strength, whitish colour,as men that féed most vpon fish; sith the cold
is so extreame in those parts, that the ground bringeth foorth but small
store of wheate, and in maner verie little or no fuell at all, wherewith
to warme them in the winter, and yet it séemeth that (in times past)
some of these Ilands also haue béene well replenished with wood, but now
they are without either trée or shrub, in stéed whereof they haue
plentie of heath, which is suffered to grow among them, rather thorough
their negligence, than that the soile of it selfe will not yéeld to
bring forth trées &amp; bushes. For what store of such hath béene in times
past, the roots yet found and digged out of the ground doo yéeld
sufficient triall. Otes they haue verie plentifullie, but greater store
of barleie, wherof they make a nappie kind of drinke, and such indéed,
as will verie readilie cause a stranger to ouershoot himselfe. Howbeit
this may be vnto vs in lieu of a miracle, that although their drinke be
neuer so strong, &amp; they themselues so vnmeasurable drinkers (as none are
<span class="leftnote">If he speake all in truth.</span>
more) yet it shall not easilie be séene (saith Hector) that there is
anie drunkard among them, either frantike, or mad man, dolt, or naturall
foole, meet to weare a cockescombe.</p>

<p>This vnmeasurable drinking of theirs is confessed also by Buchanan, who
noteth, that whensoeuer anie wine is brought vnto them from other
soiles, they take their parts thereof aboundantlie. He addeth moreouer,
how they haue an old bole (which they call S. Magnus bole, who first
preached Christ vnto them) of farre greater quantitie than common boles
are, and so great, that it may séeme to be reserued since the Lapithane
banket, onelie to quaffe and drinke in. And when anie bishop commeth
vnto them, they offer him this bole full of drinke, which if he be able
to drinke vp quite at one draught; then they assure themselues of good
lucke, and plentie after it. Neuerthelesse this excesse is not often
found in the common sort, whom penurie maketh to be more frugall; but in
their priests, and such as are of the richer calling. They succour
pirats also, and verie often exchange their vittels with their
commodities, rather for feare and want of power to resist (their Ilands
lieng so scattered) than for anie necessitie of such gains as they doo
get by those men: for in truth, they thinke themselues to haue little
need of other furniture than their owne soiles doo yéeld and offer vnto
them. This is also to be read of the inhabitants of these Ilands, that
ignorance of excesse is vnto the most part of them in stéed of physicke;
and labour and trauell a medicine for such few diseases as they are
molested and incombred withall.</p>
<p>
In like sort they want venemous beasts, chéefelie such as doo delight in
hotter soile, and all kinds of ouglie creatures. Their ewes also are so
full of increase, that some doo vsuallie bring foorth two, three, or
foure lambes at once, whereby they account our anelings (which are such
as bring foorth but one at once) rather barren than to be kept for anie
gaine. As for wild and tame foules, they haue such plentie of them, that
the people there account them rather a burthen to their soile, than a
benefit to their tables: they haue also neat and gotes, whereby they
abound in white meat, as butter and cheese: wherein, next vnto fish, the
chéefe part of their sustenance dooth consist. There is also a bishop of
the Orchades, who hath his see in Pomona the chéefe of all the Ilands,
wherein also are two strong castels, and such hath béene the
superstition of the people here, that there is almost no one of them,
that hath not one church at the least dedicated to the mother of Christ.
Finallie, there is little vse of physicke in these quarters, lesse store
of éeles, and least of frogs. As for the horsses that are bred amongst
them, they are commonlie not much greater than asses, and yet to labour
and trauell, a man shall find verie few else-where, able to come neere,
much lesse to match with them, in holding out their iournies. The seas
about these Ilands are verie tempestuous, not onelie through strong
winds, and the influences of the heauens and stars; but by the contrarie
méetings and workings of the west ocean, which rageth so vehementlie in
the streicts, that no vessell is able to passe in safetie amongst them.
Some of these Ilands also are so small and low, that all the commoditie
which is to be reaped by anie of them, is scarselie sufficient to
susteine one or two men: and some of them so barren and full of rocks,
that they are nothing else but mosse or bare shingle. Wherefore onelie
thirtéene of them are inhabited and made account of, the rest being left
<span class="page"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[Page 75]</span>
vnto their sheepe and cattell. Of all these Ilands also Pomona is the
greatest, and therfore called the continent, which conteineth thirtie
miles in length, and is well replenished with people: for it hath twelue
parish churches, and one towne which the Danes (sometime lords of that
<span class="leftnote">Kirkwa.</span>
Iland) called Cracouia: but now it hight Kirkwa. There are also two
pretie holds, one belonging to the king, the other to the bishop: and
also a beautifull church, and much building betweene the two holds, and
about this church, which being taken as it were for two townes, the one
is called the kings and the other the bishops towne. All the whole Iland
is full of cliffes and promontories, whereby no small number of baies
and some hauens are producted.</p>

<p>There is also tin and lead to be found in six of these Iles, so good and
plentifullie as anie where else in Britaine. It lieth foure &amp; twentie
miles from Cathnesse, being separated from the same by the Pictish sea:
wherein also lie certeine Ilands, as Stroma, foure miles from Cathnesse,
which albeit that it be but foure miles from Cathnesse, is not reputed
for anie of the Orchades. Going therefore from hence northward, we come
to the first Ile of the Orchades, called south Rauals, which is sixtéene
miles from Dunghilsbie, aliàs Dunachisbie, &amp; that in two houres space,
such is the swiftnesse of the sea in that tract. This Ile is fiue miles
long, and hath a faire port called saint Margarets hauen. Then passe we
by two desert Iles, which lie towards the east, wherein nothing is found
but cattell: some call them the holmes, bicause they lie low, and are
good for nothing but grasse. On the northside lieth the Bur, and two
other holmes betweene the same &amp; Pomona. From Bur, toward the west lie
thrée Iles, Sun, Flat, and Far: and beyond them Hoie and Vall, which
some accompt for two, and other but for one; bicause that in March and
September, the flats that lie betwéene them, doo séeme to ioine them
togither, after the tide is gone. This neuerthelesse is certeine, that
in this single or double Ile, which is ten miles in length, the highest
hilles are to be séene that are in all the Orchades. And as they lie
eight miles from Rauals, so are they two miles from Pomona, &amp; from saint
Donats in Scotland full twentie miles, and on the north side of it lieth
the Brainse, in a narrow streict, as Buchanan dooth remember. And these
are the Iles which lie betweene Pomona and Cathnesse. As for the west
side of the continent, I find that it lieth open to the sea, without
either shelues, Ilands, or rocks appéering néere vnto it: but on the
east side thereof Cobesa dooth in maner ouershadow it. Siapinsa also an
Ile of six miles long, lieth within two miles of Cracouia, toward the
east, on the west side of Pomona lieth the Rouse of six miles in length:
and by east of that, the Eglisa, wherin (as they saie) their patrone S.
Magnus lieth interred. From hense southward lie the Vera, Gersa, and not
far off the Vester (which is fourescore miles from Hethland) Papa &amp;
Stronza, which is also eightie miles from Hethland as is the Vester. In
the middest also of this tract lieth Far, or Fara, which is to saie,
faire Ile, in old English, faire eie: and within sight so well of
Hethland, as the Orchades (by reason of three insuperable rocks which
are apparant in the same) a verie poore Iland, and yet yearelie robbed
of such commodities as it hath by such Flemish and English fishermen as
passe by the coasts thereof in time of the yeare, to catch fish for the
prouision of their countries.</p>

<p>Next vnto this is the greatest of all the Hethlands, an Iland called the
Maine, sixtie miles in length, and sixteene in bredth, full of rocks,
and whose coasts are onelie inhabited, the innermost parts being left
vnto the foules of the aire, bicause of the barrennesse and
vnfruitfulnesse of the soile: yet of late some haue indeuoured to
impeople it, but with no successe correspondent to their desire.
Wherefore they returned to their former trades, making their chéefe
commoditie and yearelie gaine by fish, as aforetime. Ten miles from this
toward the north, lieth the Zeale, twentie miles in length, eight in
bredth, and so wild that it will suffer no creature to liue thereof,
that is not bred therein. Betwéene this Iland also and the Maine, are
other smaller Ilands to be found, as the Ling, Orne, Big, and Sanferre.
And from hense nine miles northward Vsta, twentie miles long, &amp; six in
bredth, plaine, pleasant, but inuironed with a swift and terrible sea.
Betwéene this also and the Zeale, are the Vie, the Vre, and the Ling:
also towards the west, the two Skeues, Chalseie, Nordwade, Brase, and
<span class="page"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[Page 76]</span>
Mowse, on the west side lie the west Skeies, Rottia, Papa the lesse,
Wunned, Papa the more, Valla, Londra, Burra, Haura the more, Haura the
lesse, &amp; in maner so manie holmes dispersed heere and there, whereof I
haue no notice. Some call these the Shetland, and some the Shotland
Iles. Buchanan nameth them in the third member of his diuision
Zelandine, and toward the end of his first booke seemeth to auouch, that
they liue in maner as doo the inhabitants of the Orchades: although not
in so ciuill wise, nor in such large measure and aboundance of diet in
their houses. He addeth moreouer, that their apparrell is after the
Germaine cut, comelie, but not so chargeable and costlie, and how they
raise their gaine by skins of beasts, as marterns, sheepe, oxen, and
gotes skins, and therevnto a kind of cloth which they weaue, and sell to
the merchants of Norwaie, togither with their butter, fish, either
salted or dried, and their traine oile, and exercise their trade of
fishing also in their vncerteine skewes, which they fetch out of
Norwaie.</p>

<p>Their speech is Gothish, and such of them as by their dealing with
forren merchants doo gather anie wealth, that will they verie often
bestow vpon the furniture of their houses. Their weights &amp; measures are
after the Germaine maner, their countrie is verie healthie, and so
wholesome, that a man was found which had married a wife at one hundred
yeares of age, and was able to go out a fishing with his bote at one
hundred and fortie, and of late yéeres died of méere age, without anie
other disease. Dronkennesse is not heard of among them, and yet they
meet and make good chéere verie often. Neither doo I read of anie great
vse of flesh or foule there, although that some of their Ilands haue
plentie of both. Nor anie mention of corne growing in these parts, and
therefore in steed of bread they drie a kind of fish, which they beat in
morters to powder, &amp; bake it in their ouens, vntill it be hard and drie.
Their fuell also is of such bones as the fish yéeldeth, that is taken on
their coasts: and yet they liue as themselues suppose in much felicitie,
thinking it a great péece of their happinesse to be so farre distant
from the wicked auarice, and cruell dealings of the more rich and ciuill
part of the world.</p>

<p>Herein also they are like vnto the Hirthiens, in that at one time of the
yeare, there commeth a priest vnto them out of the Orchades (vnto which
iurisdiction they doo belong) who baptiseth all such children, as haue
béene borne among them, since he last arriued, and hauing afterward
remained there for a two daies, he taketh his tithes of them (which they
prouide and paie with great scrupulositie in fish, for of other
commodities haue they none) and then returneth home againe, not without
boast of his troublesome voiage, except he watch his time. In these Iles
<span class="leftnote">Amber.</span>
also is great plentie of fine Amber to be had (as Hector saith) which is
producted by the working of the sea vpon those coasts: but more of this
elsewhere. This neuertheles is certeine, that these Ilands, with the
Orchades, were neuer perfectlie vnited to the crowne of Scotland, till
the mariage was made betwéene king Iames and the ladie Marie daughter to
Christierne king of Denmarke 1468, which Christierne at the birth of
their sonne Iames (afterward king of Scotland and called Iames the
fourth) resigned all his right and title whatsoeuer either he or his
ancestors either presently or hertofore had, might haue had, or herafter
may or should haue, vnto the aforesaid péeres, as appéereth by the
charter.</p>

<p>From these Shetland Iles, and vntill we come southwards to the Scarre,
which lieth in Buquhamnesse, I find no mention of anie Ile situat vpon
that coast, neither greatlie from thence, vntill we come at the Forth,
that leadeth vp to Sterling, neither thought we it safetie for vs to
search so farre as Thule, whence the most excellent brimstone commeth, &amp;
thereto what store of Ilands lie vnder the more northerlie climats,
whose secret situations though partlie seene in my time, haue not yet
bin perfectlie reueled or discouered by anie, bicause of the great
aboundance of huge Ilands of ice that mooueth to and fro vpon their
shores, and sundrie perilous gulfes and indraughts of water, and for as
much as their knowlege doth not concerne our purpose, wherfore casting
about, we came at the last into the Firth or Forth, which some call the
Scotish sea, wherein we passe by seuen or eight such as they be, of
which the first called the Maie, the second Baas, and Garwie the third,
doo seeme to be inhabited. From these also holding on our course toward
England, we passe by another Ile, wherein Faux castell standeth, and
<span class="page"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[Page 77]</span>
this (so far as my skill serueth) is the last Iland of the Scotish side,
in compassing whereof I am not able to discerne, whether their flats and
shallowes, number of Ilands without name, confusion of situation, lacke
of true description, or mine owne ignorance hath troubled me most. No
meruell therefore that I haue béene so oft on ground among them. But
most ioifull am I that am come home againe: &amp; although not by the Thames
mouth into my natiue citie (which taketh his name of Troie) yet into the
English dominion, where good interteinement is much more franke and
copious, and better harborough wherein to rest my wearie bones, and
refresh at ease our wetherbeaten carcasses.</p>

<p>The first Iland therefore which commeth to our sight, after we passed
<span class="leftnote">Lindesfarne or Holie Iland.</span>
Berwike, is that which was somtime called Lindesfarne, but now Holie
Iland, and conteineth eight miles; a place much honored among our
monasticall writers, bicause diuerse moonks and heremits did spend their
times therein. There was also the bishops see of Lindesfarne for a long
season, which afterward was translated to Chester in the stréet, &amp;
finallie to Duresme, Dunelme, or Durham. It was first erected by Oswald,
wherein he placed Aidanus the learned Scotish moonke, who came hither
out of the Ile called Hij, whereof Beda speaking in the third chapter of
his third booke, noteth, that although the said Hij belong to the kings
of Northumberland, by reason of situation &amp; néerenesse to the coast; yet
the Picts appointed the bishops of the same, and gaue the Ile with the
see it selfe to such Scotish moonks as they liked, bicause that by their
preaching they first receiued the faith. But to returne to Lindesfarne.
After Aidan departed this life, Finanus finished and builded the whole
church with sawed timber of oke, after the maner of his countrie, which
when Theodorus the archbishop of Canturburie had dedicated, Edbert the
bishop did couer ouer with lead.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Farne.</span>
Next vnto this is the Ile of Farne, and herein is a place of defense so
far as I remember, and so great store of egs laid there by diuerse kinds
of wildfoule in time of the yeare, that a man shall hardlie run for a
wager on the plaine ground without the breach of manie, before his race
be finished. About Farne also lie certeine Iles greater than Farne it
selfe, but void of inhabitants; and in these also is great store of
<span class="leftnote">Puffins.</span>
puffins, graie as duckes, and without coloured fethers, sauing that they
haue a white ring round about their necks. There is moreouer another
<span class="leftnote">Saint Cuthberts foules.</span>
bird, which the people call saint Cuthberts foules, a verie tame and
gentle creature, and easie to be taken. After this we came to the Cocket
Iland; so called, bicause it lieth ouer against the fall of Cocket
water. Herein is a veine of meane seacole, which the people dig out of
the shore at the low water; and in this Iland dwelled one Henrie
sometime a famous heremite, who (as his life declareth) came of the
Danish race. And from thence vntill we came vnto the coast of Norffolke
I saw no more Ilands.</p>

<p>Being therfore past S. Edmunds point, we found a litle Ile ouer against
the fall of the water that commeth from Holkham, &amp; likewise another ouer
against the Claie, before we came at Waburne hope: the third also in
Yarmouth riuer ouer against Bradwell, a towne in low or little England,
whereof also I must néeds saie somewhat, bicause it is in maner an
Iland, and as I gesse either hath béene or may be one: for the brodest
place of the strict land that leadeth to the same, is little aboue a
quarter of a mile, which against the raging waues of the sea can make
<span class="leftnote">Little England.</span>
but small resistance. Little England or low England therefore is about
eight miles in length and foure in bredth, verie well replenished with
townes, as Fristan, Burgh castell, Olton, Flixton, Lestoft, Gunton,
Blundston, Corton, Lownd, Ashebie, Hoxton, Belton, Bradwell, and
Gorleston, and beside this it is verie fruitfull and indued with all
commodities.</p>

<p>Going forward from hence, by the Estonnesse (almost an Iland) I saw a
small parcell cut from the maine in Orford hauen, the Langerstone in
Orwell mouth, &amp; two péeces or Islets at Cattiwade bridge; and then
<span class="leftnote">Merseie.</span>
casting about vnto the Colne, we beheld Merseie which is a pretie Iland,
well furnished with wood. It was sometime a great receptacle for the
Danes when they inuaded England; howbeit at this present it hath beside
two decaied blockehouses, two parish churches, of which one is called
east Merseie, the other west Merseie, and both vnder the archdeacon of
<span class="leftnote">Foulnesse.</span>
Colchester, as parcell of his iurisdiction. Foulenesse is an Ile void of
<span class="page"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[Page 78]</span>
wood, and yet well replenished with verie good grasse for neat and
sheepe, whereof the inhabitants haue great plentie: there is also a
parish church, and albeit that it stand somewhat distant from the shore,
yet at a dead low water a man may (as they saie) ride thereto if he be
skilfull of the causie; it is vnder the iurisdiction of London. And at
this present master William Tabor bacheler of diuinitie and archdeacon
of Essex hath it vnder his iurisdiction &amp; regiment, by the surrender of
maister Iohn Walker doctor also of diuinitie, who liued at such time as
I first attempted to commit this booke to the impression.</p>

<p>In Maldon water are in like sort thrée Ilands inuironed all with salt
<span class="leftnote">Osithe.<br />
Northeie.</span>
streames, as saint Osithes, Northeie, and another (after a mersh) that
beareth no name so far as I remember. On the right hand also as we went
<span class="rightnote">Ramseie.<br />
Reie.</span>
toward the sea againe, we saw Ramseie Ile, or rather a Peninsula or
Biland, &amp; likewise the Reie, in which is a chappell of saint Peter. And
then coasting vpon the mouth of the Bourne, we saw the Wallot Ile and
his mates, whereof two lie by east Wallot, and the fourth is Foulnesse,
except I be deceiued, for here my memorie faileth me on the one side,
and information on the other, I meane concerning the placing of
Foulenesse. But to procéed. After this, and being entered into the
Thames mouth, I find no Iland of anie name, except you accompt Rochford
hundred for one, whereof I haue no mind to intreat, more than of
Crowland, Mersland, Elie, and the rest, that are framed by the ouze.
Andredeseie in Trent, so called of a church there dedicated to saint
Andrew, and Auon (two noble riuers hereafter to be described) sith I
touch onelie those that are inuironed with the sea or salt water round
<span class="leftnote">Canwaie.</span>
about, as we may see in the Canwaie Iles, which some call marshes
onelie, and liken them to an ipocras bag, some to a vice, scrue, or wide
sléeue, bicause they are verie small at the east end, and large at west.
The salt rilles also that crosse the same doo so separat the one of them
from the other, that they resemble the slope course of the cutting part
of a scrue or gimlet, in verie perfect maner, if a man doo imagine
himselfe to looke downe from the top of the mast vpon them. Betwéene
these, moreouer and the Leigh towne lieth another litle Ile or Holme,
whose name is to me vnknowne. Certes I would haue gone to land and
viewed these parcels as they laie, or at the least haue sailed round
about them by the whole hauen, which may easilie be doone at an high
water: but for as much as a perrie of wind (scarse comparable to the
makerell gale, whereof Iohn Anele of Calis one of the best seamen that
England euer bred for his skill in the narow seas was woont to talke)
caught hold of our sailes, &amp; caried vs forth the right waie toward
London, I could not tarie to sée what things were hereabouts. Thus much
therefore of our Ilands, &amp; so much may well suffice where more cannot be
had.</p>

<small>THE DESCRIPTION OF THE THAMES, AND SUCH RIUERS AS FALL INTO THE SAME.</small><br />

CAP. XI.</h3>

<p>Hauing (as you haue séene) attempted to set downe a full discourse of
all the Ilands, that are situat vpon the coast of Britaine, and finding
the successe not correspondent to mine intent, it hath caused me
somewhat to restreine my purpose in this description also of our riuers.
For whereas I intended at the first to haue written at large, of the
number, situation, names, quantities, townes, villages, castels,
mounteines, fresh waters, plashes or lakes, salt waters, and other
commodities of the aforesaid Iles, mine expectation of information from
all parts of England, was so deceiued in the end, that I was faine at
last onelie to leane to that which I knew my selfe either by reading, or
such other helpe as I had alreadie purchased and gotten of the same. And
euen so it happeneth in this my tractation of waters, of whose heads,
courses, length, bredth, depth of chanell (for burden) ebs, flowings,
and falles, I had thought to haue made a perfect description vnder the
report also of an imagined course taken by them all. But now for want of
instruction, which hath béene largelie promised, &amp; slacklie perfourmed,
and other sudden and iniurious deniall of helpe voluntarilie offered,
<span class="page"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[Page 79]</span>
without occasion giuen on my part, I must needs content my selfe with
such obseruations as I haue either obteined by mine owne experience, or
gathered from time to time out of other mens writings: whereby the full
discourse of the whole is vtterlie cut off, and in steed of the same a
mangled rehearsall of the residue set downe and left in memorie.</p>

<p>Wherefore I beséech your honour to pardon this imperfection and
rudenesse of my labour, which notwithstanding is not altogither in
vaine, sith my errors maie prooue a spurre vnto the better skilled,
either to correct or inlarge where occasion serueth, or at the leastwise
to take in hand a more absolute péece of worke, as better direction
shall incourage them thereto. The entrance and beginning of euerie thing
is the hardest; and he that beginneth well, hath atchiued halfe his
purpose. The ice (my lord) is broken, and from hencefoorth it will be
more easie for such as shall come after to wade through with the rest,
sith "Facile est inuentis addere;" and to continue and finish, is not so
great a matter in building, as to attempt and laie the foundation or
platforme of anie noble péece of workmanship, though it be but rudelie
<span class="leftnote">Thamesis.</span>
handled. But to my purpose. As I began at the Thames in my description
of Ilands, so will I now doo the like with that of famous riuers; making
mine entrie at the said riuer it selfe, of whose founteine some men make
as much adoo, as in time past of the true head of Nilus, which, till of
late (if it be yet descried) was neuer found: or the Tanais, whose
originall was neuer knowne, nor shall be: for whilest one placeth it
here, another there; there are none at all that deale with it exactlie.
Wherefore leaning to such mens writings as haue of set purpose sought
out the spring of the Thames; I affirme that this famous streame hath
his head or beginning out of the side of an hill, standing in the
plaines of Cotswold, about one mile from Tetburie, néere vnto the Fosse
(an high waie so called of old) where it was sometime named Isis, or the
Ouse, although diuerse doo ignorantlie call it the Thames euen there,
rather of a foolish custome than anie skill, bicause they either neglect
or vtterlie are ignorant how it was named at the first. From hence it
runneth directlie toward the east (as all good riuers should) and
<span class="leftnote">Corinium.</span>
méeteth with the Cirne or Churne, (a brooke called in Latine Corinium)
whereof Cirncester towne (by which it commeth) doth take the
denomination.</p>

<p>From hence it hasteth vnto Créekelade, aliàs Crekanford, Lechlade,
Radcotebridge, Newbridge, and Eouesham, receiuing by the waie an infinit
sort of small streames, brookes, beckes, waters, and rundels: and here
on this side of the towne diuideth it selfe into two courses, of which
the one goeth straight to Botleie and Hinkseie, the other by Godstow, a
village not farre off. This latter spreadeth it selfe also for a while
into sundrie smaller branches, which run not farre yer they be reunited,
and then beclipping sundrie pleasant meadowes, it passeth at length by
Oxford, of some supposed rather to be called Ouseford of this riuer,
<span class="leftnote">Charwell.</span>
where it meeteth with the Charwell, and a litle from whence the
originall branches doo ioine and go togither by Abbandune (aliàs Sensham
or Abington as we call it) although no part of it at the first came so
néere the towne as it doth now, till a branch thereof was led thither
<span class="leftnote">Some write, that the maine streame was brought thither
from which ranne before betweene Andredeseie and Culenham.</span> the maine
streame, thorough the industrie of the moonks, as (beside the testimonie
of old records thereof yet extant to be séene) by the decaie of Cair
Dour, now Dorchester it selfe, sometime the throughfare from Wales and
the west countrie to London, which insued vpon this fact, is easie to be
seene. From hence it goeth to Dorchester, and so to Thame, where ioining
with a riuer of the same denomination, it looseth the name of Isis or
Ouse (whereof Ouseneie at Oxford is producted) and from thenceforth is
called Thamesis. From Thame it goeth to Wallingford, and so to Reding,
<span class="rightnote">Pontium.</span>
which in time past, of the number of bridges there, was called Pontium;
albeit that the English name doth rather proceed from Rhe, or Ree, the
<span class="leftnote">Saint Marie ouer Rhee.</span>
Saxon word for a water-course or riuer; which maie be séene in Ouerée,
or Sutherée, for ouer the Ree, or south of the Rhee, as to the skilfull
doth readilie appéere; yet some hold (and not altogither against
probabilitie and likelihood) that the word Sutherée is so called of
Sudrijc, to wit, the south kingdome, wherevnto in part the Thames is a
bound. But that holdeth not in denomination, either of the said church
or name of the foresaid countie. Other affirme likewise, that Reding is
so called of the Greeke word (<ins title="Greek: rheô">&#8165;&epsilon;&omega;</ins>) which is to ouerflowe.
Certes, as neither of these coniectures are to be contemned, so the last
<span class="page"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[Page 80]</span>
c&#333;meth most neere to mine aid, who affirme, that not onelie the
course of euerie water it selfe, but also his ouerflowing was in time
past called Rhe, by such Saxons as inhabited in this Iland: and euen to
this daie in Essex I haue oft obserued, that when the lower grounds by
rage of water haue béene ouerflowen, the people beholding the same, haue
said; All is on a Rhe, as if they should haue said; All is now a riuer,
albeit the word Riuer be deriued from the French, and borrowed by them
from the Latins, but not without corruption, as it was brought vnto
them. I will not here giue notice how farre they are deceiued, which
call the aforesaid church by the name of S. Marie Auderies, or S. Marie
ouer Isis, or Ise: but I will procéed with the course of this noble
streame, which, howsoeuer these matters stand after it hath passed by
<span class="leftnote">Kenet.</span>
Reding, &amp; there receiued the Kenet, which commeth from the hilles that
<span class="rightnote">Thetis.</span>
lie west of Marleborough (&amp; then the Thetis, commonlie called the Tide
that commeth from Thetisford) hieth to Sudlington otherwise called
Maidenhead, and so to Windleshore (or Windsore) Eaton, and then to
Chertseie, where Erkenwald bishop of London sometime builded a religious
house or cell, as I doo read.</p>

<p>From Chertseie it hasteth directlie vnto Stanes, and receiuing an other
<span class="leftnote">Cole.</span>
streame by the waie, called the Cole (wherevpon Colbrooke standeth) it
goeth by Kingstone, Shene, Sion and Brentford or Bregentford, where it
méeteth the Brane or the Brene (another brooke descending from Edgworth)
whose name signifieth a frog, in the Brittish speach. Vpon this also sir
John Thin had sometime a statelie house, with a maruellous prouision to
inclose and reteine such fish as should come about the same. From
<span class="leftnote">Brene.</span>
Brentfoord it passeth by Mortlach, Putneie, Fulham, Batterseie,
Chelseie, Lambeth, and so to London. Finallie going from thence vnto the
sea, it taketh the Lée with it by the waie vpon the coast of Essex, and
<span class="leftnote">Darwent.</span>
another that commeth from Abreche not far off, and the Darnt vpon Kent
side, which riseth néere to Tanrige, and commeth by Shoreham, vnto
<span class="leftnote">Craie.</span>
Derntford, wherevnto the Craie falleth. And last of all the Medwaie a
notable riuer (in mine opinion) which watereth all the south and
southwest part of Kent, and whose description shall insue.</p>

<p>Hauing in this maner bréefelie touched this noble riuer, and such
brookes as fall into the same; I will now adde a particular description
of each of these last by themselues, whereby their courses also shall be
seuerallie described to the satisfaction of the studious. But yer I take
the same in hand, I will insert a word or two of the commodities of the
said riuer, which I will performe with so much breuitie as is possible.
Héereby also finding out his whole tract and course from the head to the
fall thereof into the sea. It appeareth euidentlie that the length
thereof is at the least, one hundreth and eightie miles, if it be
measured by the iourneies of the land. And as it is in course, the
longest of the thrée famous riuers of this Ile, so it is nothing
inferiour vnto them in aboundance of all kind of fish, whereof it is
hard to saie, which of the three haue either most plentie, or greatest
varietie, if the circumstances be duelie weighed. What some other write
of the riuers of their countries it skilleth not, neither will I (as
diuerse doo) inuent strange things of this noble streame, therewith to
nobilitate and make it more honorable: but this will I in plaine termes
affirme, that it neither swalloweth vp bastards of the Celtish brood, or
casteth vp the right begotten that are throwne in without hurt into
their mothers lap, as Politian fableth of the Rhene, Epistolarum lib. 8.
epi. 6. nor yéeldeth clots of gold as the Tagus dooth: but an infinit
plentie of excellent, swéet and pleasant fish, wherewith such as inhabit
néere vnto hir bankes are fed and fullie nourished.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Salmons.</span>
What should I speake of the fat and swéet salmons, dailie taken in this
streame, and that in such plentie (after the time of the smelt be past)
as no riuer in Europa is able to excéed it. What store also of barbels,
trouts, cheuins, pearches, smelts, breames, roches, daces, gudgings,
flounders, shrimps, &amp;c: are commonlie to be had therein, I refer me to
them that know by experience better than I, by reason of their dailie
trade of fishing in the same. And albeit it seemeth from time to time,
to be as it were defrauded in sundrie wise of these hir large
commodities, by the insatiable auarice of the fishermen, yet this famous
riuer complaineth commonlie of no want, but the more it looseth at one
time, the more it yéeldeth at another. Onelie in carps it séemeth to be
<span class="page"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[Page 81]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Carps a fish late brought into England
and later into the Thames.</span>
scant, sith it is not long since that kind of fish was brought ouer into
England, and but of late to speake of into this streame, by the violent
rage of sundrie landflouds, that brake open the heads and dams of diuers
gentlemens ponds, by which means it became somewhat partaker also of
this said commoditie, whereof earst it had no portion that I could euer
heare. Oh that this riuer might be spared but euen one yeare from nets,
&amp;c! But alas then should manie a poore man be vndoone. In the meane time
it is lamentable to see, how it is and hath béene choked of late with
sands and shelues, through the penning and wresting of the course of the
water for commodities sake. But as this is an inconuenience easilie
remedied, if good order were taken for the redresse thereof: so now, the
fine or prise set vpon the ballasse sometime freelie giuen to the
merchants by patent, euen vnto the lands end (Iusques au poinct) will be
another cause of harme vnto this noble streame, and all through an
aduantage taken at the want of an (i) in the word ponct: which grew
through an error committed by an English notarie vnskilfull in the
French toong, wherein that patent was granted.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the said riuer floweth and filleth all his chanels twise in
the daie and night, that is in euerie twelue houres once; and this
ebbing &amp; flowing, holdeth on for the space of seauentie miles, within
the maine land: the streame or tide being alwaies highest at London,
when the moone dooth exactlie touch the northeast and south or west
points of the heauens, of which one is visible, the other vnder the
earth, and not subiect to our sight. These tides also differ in their
times, each one comming latter than other, by so manie minuts as passe
yer the reuolution and naturall course of the heauens doo reduce, and
bring about the said planet vnto those hir former places: whereby the 36
<span class="leftnote">The iust dist&#257;ce betwéene one tide and another.</span>
common difference betwéene one tide and another, is found to consist of
twentie foure minuts, which wanteth but twelue of an whole houre in
foure and twentie, as experience dooth confirme. In like sort we sée by
dailie triall, that each tide is not of equall heigth and greatnesse:
for at the full and change of the moone we haue the greatest flouds, and
such is their ordinarie course, that as they diminish from their changes
and fuls, vnto the first and last quarters; so afterwards they increase
againe, vntill they come to the full and change. Sometimes also they
rise so high (if the wind be at the north or northeast, which bringeth
in the water with more vehemencie, bicause the tide which filleth the
chanell, commeth from Scotland ward) that the Thames ouerfloweth hir
banks néere vnto London: which hapneth especiallie in the fuls and
changes of Januarie and Februarie, wherein the lower grounds are of
custome soonest drowned. This order of flowing in like sort is
perpetuall, so that when the moone is vpon the southwest and north of
points, then is the water by London at the highest: neither doo the
tides alter, except some rough winds out of the west or southwest doo
<span class="leftnote">The streame oft checked in hir entrance into the land.</span>
kéepe backe and checke the streame in his entrance, as the east and
northeast do hasten the comming in thereof, or else some other
extraordinarie occasion, put by the ordinarie course of the northerne
seas, which fill the said riuer by their naturall returne and flowing.
And that both these doo happen eft among, I refer me to such as haue not
sildome obserued it, as also the sensible chopping in of thrée or foure
tides in one naturall daie, wherof the vnskilfull doo descant manie
things.</p>

<p>But how so euer these small matters doo fall out, and how often soeuer
this course of the streame doth happen to be disturbed; yet at two
seuerall times of the age of the moone, the waters returne to their
naturall course and limits of time exactlie. Polydore saith, that this
riuer is seldome increased or rather neuer ouerfloweth hir banks by
landflouds: but he is herein verie much deceiued, as it shalbe more
apparentlie séene hereafter. For the more that this riuer is put by of
hir right course, the more the water must of necessitie swell with the
white waters which run downe from the land: bicause the passage cannot
be so swift and readie in the winding as in the streight course. These
landflouds also doo greatlie straine the finesse of the streame, in so
much that after a great landfloud, you shall take haddocks with your
hands beneath the bridge, as they flote aloft vpon the water, whose eies
are so blinded with the thicknesse of that element, that they cannot see
<span class="page"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[Page 82]</span>
where to become, and make shift to saue themselues before death take
hold of them. Otherwise the water of it selfe is verie cléere, and in
comparison next vnto that of the sea, which is most subtile and pure of
all other; as that of great riuers is most excellent, in comparison of
smaller brookes: although Aristotle will haue the salt water to be most
grosse, bicause a ship will beare a greater burden on the sea than on
the fresh water; and an eg sinke in this that swimmeth on the other. But
he may easilie be answered by the quantitie of roome and aboundance of
waters in the sea; whereby it becommeth of more force to susteine such
vessels as are committed to the same, and whervnto the greatest riuers
(God wot) are nothing comparable. I would here make mention of sundrie
<span class="leftnote">London bridge.</span>
bridges placed ouer this noble streame, of which that of London is most
chieflie to be commended, for it is in maner a c&#333;tinuall street, well
replenished with large and statelie houses on both sides, and situat
vpon twentie arches, whereof ech one is made of excellent free squared
stone, euerie of them being thréescore foot in height, and full twentie
in distance one from another, as I haue often viewed.</p>

<p>In like maner I could intreat of the infinit number of swans dailie to be séene
<span class="leftnote">2000 boates vpon the Thames
and 3000 poore m&#275; mainteined by
the same whose gaines come in
most plentifullie in the tearme time.</span>
vpon this riuer, the two thousand wherries and small boats, wherby three thousand
poore watermen are mainteined, through the cariage and recariage of such
persons as passe or repasse, from time to time vpon the same: beside
those huge tideboats, tiltbotes, and barges, which either carrie
passengers, or bring necessarie prouision from all quarters of
Oxfordshire, Barkeshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Herfordshire,
Midlesex, Essex, Surrie, and Kent, vnto the citie of London. But for
somuch as these things are to be repeated againe in the particular
description of London, annexed to his card; I surceasse at this time to
speake anie more of them here, as not lingering but hasting to performe
my promise made euen now, not yet forgotten, and in performance whereof
I thinke it best to resume the description of this noble riuer againe
into my hands, and in adding whatsoeuer is before omitted, to deliuer a
full and perfect demonstration of his course. How and where the said
streame ariseth, is alreadie &amp; with sufficiencie set downe, noting the
place to be within a mile of Tetburie, whereof some doo vtterlie
mislike, bicause that rill in summer drouths is oft so drie, that there
is little or no water at all séene running aboue ground in the same.
<span class="leftnote">Isis.</span>
For this cause therefore manie affirme the verie head of Isis to come
from the poole aboue Kemble. Other confound it with the head of the
Cirne or Chirne, called in Latine Corinium that riseth aboue Coberleie.
For my part I follow Leland, as he dooth the moonke of Malmesburie,
which wrote the historie intituled Eulogium historiarum, who searched
the same of set purpose, and pronounced with Leland, although at this
present that course be verie small, and choked vp (as I heare) with
grauell and sand. Procéeding therefore from the head, it first of all
<span class="leftnote">Couus.</span>
receiueth the Kemble water called the Coue, which riseth aboue Kemble
towne, goeth by Kemble it selfe vnto Poole and Somerford, and then
(accompanieth the Thames) vnto Canes, Ashton, Canes, and Howston,
holding on in one chanell vntill they méet with the Chirne, the next of
all to be described.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Corinium.</span>
The Chirne is a faire water arising out of the ground aboue Coberleie,
from whence it runneth to Cowleie, Cowlesburne, Randcome, and so into
the Isis on the left side aboue Crekelade. These thrée waters being thus
vnited and brought into one chanell, within a little space of the head
of Isis, it runneth on by Crekelade, beneath which towne it receiueth
<span class="leftnote">Rhe.</span>
the Rhe, descending from Elcombe, Escot, Redburne, Widhill, &amp; at the
fall into Isis, or not far off ioineth with another that runneth west of
Purton by Braden forrest, &amp;c. Next of all our Isis méeteth with the
<span class="leftnote">Amneie.</span>
Amneie on the left hand, which comming from aboue Holie roode Amneie,
runneth by Downe Amneie, and finallie into the Isis a little aboue
Iseie. In like sort I read of another that méeteth withall on the right
hand aboue Iseie also, which so far as I can call to remembrance,
commeth from about Drifield and falleth so into our Isis, that they run
as one vntill they come at the Colne, although not so nakedlie and
without helpe, but that in this voiage, the maine streame dooth crosse
one water that descendeth from Swindon, and going also by Stratton
<span class="page"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[Page 83]</span>
toward Seuingham, is it selfe increased with two rils by the waie,
whereof one commeth from Liddenton by Wambreie, as I haue béene
informed.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Colneius, Colineus, or Colunus.</span>
The Colne is a faire riuer rising by north neere to Witchington, &amp; from
thence goeth to Shiptons, Compton Abdale, Wittenton, Parneworth, Colne
Deanes, and Colne Rogers, Winston, Biberie, Colne Alens, Quenington,
Faireford, and west of Lachelade into the riuer Isis, which hereabout on
the southside also taketh in another, whereof I find this remembrance.
The Isis being once past Seuingham, crosseth a brooke from southest that
mounteth about Ashbirie, and receiuing a rill from bywest (that commeth
from Hinton) beneath Shrineham, it afterward so diuideth it selfe, that
the armes therof include Inglesham, and by reason that it falleth into
the Isis at two seuerall places, there is a plesant Iland producted,
whereof let this suffice.</p>
<p>
Being past Lechelade a mile,<span class="leftnote">Lecusor Leche.</span>
it runneth to saint Johns bridge, &amp;
thereabout méeteth with the Leche on the left hand. This brooke, whereof
Lechlade taketh the name (a towne wherevnto one péece of an old
vniuersitie is ascribed, which it did neuer possesse, more than
Crekelade did the other) riseth east of Hampnet, fr&#333; whence it goeth
to north Lech, Estenton, Anlesworth, east Lech, south Thorpe, Farendon,
&amp; so into the Isis. From hence this famous water goeth by Kenskot toward
Radcote bridge (taking in the rill that riseth in an od péece of
Barkeshire, and runneth by Langford) and being past the said bridge (now
notable through a conspiracie made there sometimes by sundrie barons
against the estate) it is not long yer it crosse two other waters, both
of them descending from another od parcell of the said countie, whereof
I haue this note giuen me for my further information. There are two fals
of water into Isis beneath Radcote bridge, wherof the one commeth from
Shilton in Barkeshire by Arescote, blacke Burton and Clarrefield. The
other also riseth in the same péece, and runneth by Brisenorton vnto
Bampton, and there receiuing an armelet from the first that breake off
at blacke Burton, it is not long yer they fall into Isis, and leaue a
pretie Iland. After these confluences, the maine course of
<span class="leftnote">Winrush.</span>
the streame hasteth by Shifford to Newbridge, where it ioineth with the
Winrush. The Winrush riseth aboue Shieburne in Glocestershire, from
whence it goeth to Winrush, &amp; c&#333;ming by Barrington, Burford,
Widbrooke, Swinbecke castell, Witneie, Duckington, Cockthorpe, Stanlake,
it méeteth with the Isis west by south of Northmore. From hence it goeth
beneath Stanton, Hartingcourt and Ensham, betwéene which and Cassinton,
<span class="leftnote">Briwerus.</span>
it receiueth (as Leland calleth it) the Bruerne water.</p>

<p>It riseth aboue Limington, and going to Norton in the Marsh, and through
a patch of Worcestershire vnto Euenlode, betweene it and the foure
<span class="leftnote">Comus.</span>
shirestones, it taketh in a rill called Come, comming by the long and
the little Comptons. After this also it goeth by Bradwell, Odington, and
<span class="leftnote">Rolrich.</span>
so to Bleddenton, aboue which towne it taketh in the Rolrich water that
issueth at two heads, in the hils that lie by west of little Rolrich,
and ioine aboue Kenkeham, and Church hill. From thence also it goeth
vnto Bruerne, Shipton vnderwood, Ascot, Short hamton, Chorleburie,
Corneburie parke, Stonfield, Longcombe, and southeast of Woodstocke
<span class="leftnote">Enis.</span>
parke, taketh in the Enis, that riseth aboue Emstone, and goeth to
Ciddington, Glimton, Wotton (where it is increased with a rill that
runneth thither from stéeple Barton, by the Béechin trée) Woodstocke,
Blaidon, so that after this confluence, the said Enis runneth to
Cassinton, and so into the Isis, which goeth from hence to Oxford, and
there receiueth the Charwell, now presentlie to be described.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Charwell.</span>
The head of Charwell is in Northamptonshire, where it riseth out of a
little poole, by Charleton village, seuen miles aboue Banberie
northeast, and there it issueth so fast at the verie surge, that it
groweth into a pretie streame, in maner out of hand. Soone after also
<span class="leftnote">Bure.</span>
it taketh in a rillet called the Bure, which falleth into it, about
Otmere side: but forasmuch as it riseth by Bincester, the whole course
therof is not aboue foure miles, and therefore cannot be great. A friend
of mine prosecuting the rest of this description reporteth thereof as
followeth. Before the Charwell commeth into Oxfordshire, it receiueth the
<span class="leftnote">Culen.</span>
Culen, which falleth into the same, a little aboue Edgcote, and so
<span class="page"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[Page 84]</span>
descending toward Wardington, it méeteth with another comming from by
north west, betweene Wardington and Cropreadie. At Banberie also it
<span class="leftnote">Come.</span>
méeteth with the Come (which falleth from fennie Conton by Farneboro,
and afterwards going by kings Sutton, not far from Aine, it receiueth
the discharge of diuerse rillets, in one bottome before it come at
Clifton. The said water therfore ingendred of so manie brookelets,
<span class="leftnote">Ocus.</span>
consisteth chiefelie of two, whereof the most southerlie called Oke,
commeth from Oke Norton, by Witchington or Wiggington, and the Berfords;
and carieng a few blind rils withall, dooth méet with the other that
falleth from by northwest into the same, within a mile of Charwell.</p>

<p>That other (as I coniecture) is increased of thrée waters, wherof each
<span class="leftnote">Tudo.</span>
one hath his seuerall name. The first of them therefore hight Tudo,
which comming betwéene Epwell and the Lée by Toddington, ioineth about
<span class="leftnote">Ornus.</span>
Broughton with the second that runneth from Horneton, named Ornus, as I
gesse. The last falleth into the Tude or Tudelake, beneath Broughton;
and for that it riseth not far from Sotteswell in Warwikeshire, some are
<span class="leftnote">Sotbrooke.</span>
of the opinion, that it is to be called Sotbrooke. The next water that
méeteth without Charwell beneath Clifton commeth from about Croughton,
<span class="rightnote">Souarus.<br />Sowar.</span>
and after this is the Sowar or Swere, that riseth north of Michaell Tew,
<span class="leftnote">Burus.</span>
and runneth by nether Wotton. The last of all is the Reie aliàs Bure,
whose head is not far aboue Burcester, aliàs Bincester, and Burncester:
and from whence it goeth by Burecester to Merton, Charleton, Fencote,
Addington, Noke, Islip, and so into Charwell, that holdeth on his course
after this augmentation of the waters, betwéene Wood and Water Eton, to
Marston, and the east bridge of Oxford by Magdalene college, and so
beneath the south bridge into our aforesaid Isis.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Middest of England whereabouts.</span>
In describing this riuer, this one thing (right honorable) is come vnto
my mind, touching the center and nauill as it were of England. Certes
there is an hillie plot of ground in Helledon parish, not <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'far' missing from original.">far</ins> from
Danberie, where a man maie stand and behold the heads of thrée notable
riuers, whose waters, and those of such as fall into them, doo
abundantlie serue the greatest part of England on this side of the
Humber. The first of these waters is the Charwell, alreadie described.
The second is the Leme that goeth westward into the fourth Auon. And the
third is the head of the Nene or fift Auon it selfe, of whose courses
there is no card but doth make sufficient mention; and therefore your
honour maie behold in the same how they doo coast the countrie, and also
measure by compasses how this plot lieth in respect of all the rest,
contrarie to common iudgement, which maketh Northampton to be the
middest and center of our countrie.</p>

<p>But to go forward with my description of the Ouse, which being past
Oxford goeth to Iflie, Kennington, Sanford, Rodleie, Newnham, and so to
Abington, som time called Sensham, without increase, where it receiueth
<span class="leftnote">Ocus.</span>
the Oche, otherwise called the Coche, a little beneath S. Helens, which
runneth thither of two brooklets, as I take it, whereof one commeth from
Compton, out of the vale and west of the hill of the White horsse, the
other from Kings Letcombe, and Wantage in Barkshire, and in one chanell,
entreth into the same, vpon the right side of his course. From Abington
<span class="leftnote">Arun.</span>
likewise (taking the Arun withall southwest of Sutton Courtneie) it
goeth by Appleford, long Wittenham, Clifton, Wittenham the lesse, &amp;
beneath Dorchester, taketh in the Thame water, from whence the Isis
loseth the preheminence of the whole denomination of this riuer, and is
contented to impart the same with the Thame, so that by the coniunction
of these two waters Thamesis is producted, and that name continued euen
vnto the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Thame.</span>
Thame riuer riseth in the easterlie parts of Chilterne hils, towards
Penleie parke, at a towne called Tring west of the said parke, which is
seauen miles from the stone bridge, that is betweene Querendon and
Ailsburie (after the course of the water) as Leland hath set downe.
Running therefore by long Merston, and Puttenham, Hucket, and Bearton,
it receiueth soone after a rill that commeth by Querendon from Hardwike,
and yer long an other on the other side that riseth aboue Windouer in
the Chilterne, and passing by Halton, Weston, Turrill, Broughton, and
Ailsburie, it falleth into the Tame west of the said towne (except my
memorie doo faile me.) From this confluence the Tame goeth by Ethorpe,
<span class="page"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[Page 85]</span>
the Winchingtons, Coddington, Chersleie, Notleie abbeie: and comming
almost to Tame, it receiueth one water from southeast aboue the said
towne, and another also from the same quarter beneath the towne; so that
Tame standeth inuironed vpon thrée sides with thrée seuerall waters, as
maie be easilie séene. The first of these commeth from the Chiltern east
of Below or Bledlow, from whence it goeth to Hinton, Horsenden,
Kingseie, Towseie, and so into the Tame. The other descendeth also from
the Chilterne, and going by Chinner, Crowell, Siddenham, and Tame parke,
it falleth in the end into Tame water, and then they procéed togither as
one by Shabbington, Ricot parke, Dracot, Waterstoke, Milton, Cuddesdon,
and Chiselton. Here also it taketh in another water from by-east, whose
head commeth from Chilterne hils, not farre from Stocking church, in the
waie from Oxford to London. From whence it runneth to Weston (and
méeting beneath Cuxham with Watlington rill) it goeth onto Chalgraue,
Stadham, and so into the Tame. From hence our streame of Thame runneth
to Newenton, Draton, Dorchester (sometime a bishops see, and a noble
citie) and so into the Thames, which hasteth in like sort to Bensington,
<span class="leftnote">Blauius.</span>
Crowmarsh, or Wallingford, where it receiueth the Blaue, descending from
Blaueburg, now Blewberie, as I learne.</p>

<p>Thus haue I brought the Thames vnto Wallingford, situate in the vale of
White horsse, that runneth a long therby. From hence it goeth by
Newenham, north Stoke, south Stoke, Goring, Bassilden, Pangburne, where
it meeteth with a water that commeth from about Hamsted Norris, runneth
by Frizelham, Buckelburie, Stanford, Bradfeld, Tidmarsh and Pangburne.
After which confluence it goeth on betweene Mapledorham and Purleie, to
Cauersham, and Cauersham manour, and a little beneath receiueth the
Kenet that commeth thereinto from Reading.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Cenethus.</span>
The Kenet riseth aboue Ouerton 5 or 6 miles west of Marleborow, or
Marlingsborow, as some call it; &amp; then going by Fifeld, Clatfor, Maulon,
&amp; Preshute, vnto Marleburie: it holdeth on in like order to Ramsburie,
and northwest of little Cote, taketh in a water by north descending from
the hilles aboue Alburne chase west of Alburne town. Thence it runneth
to little Cote, Charnhamstréet, &amp; beneth Charnhamstréet it crosseth the
<span class="leftnote">Bedwiine.<br />Chalkeburne.</span>
Bedwin, which (taking the Chalkburne rill withall) commeth from great
Bedwijne, &amp; at Hungerford also two other in one botom somewhat beneath
the towne. From hence it goeth to Auington, Kinburie, Hamsted marshall,
<span class="leftnote">Lamburne.</span>
Euburne, Newberie; and beneath this towne, taketh in the Lamburne water
that commeth by Isberie, Egerston, the Sheffords, Westford, Boxford,
Donington castell, and Shaw. From Newberie it goeth to Thatcham,
<span class="leftnote">Alburnus.</span>
Wolhampton, Aldermaston, a little aboue which village it receiueth the
Alburne, another brooke increased with sundrie rils: and thus going on
to Padworth, Oston, and Michaell, it commeth at last to Reading, where
(as I said) it ioineth with the Thames, and so they go forward as one by
Sonning to Shiplake, and there on the east side receiue the Loddon that
commeth downe thither from the south, as by his course appéereth.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Lodunus.</span>
The Loddon riseth in Hamshire betwéene west Shirburne and Wooton toward
the southwest, afterward directing his course toward the northwest,
thorough the Vine, it passeth at the last by Bramlie, and thorough a
peece of Wiltshire, to Stradfield, Swallowfield, Arberfield, Loddon
bridge, leauing a patch of Wiltshire on the right hand (as I haue béene
informed.) This Loddon not far from Turges towne receiueth two waters in
one bottome, whereof the westerlie called Basing water, commeth from
Basingstoke, and thorough a parke vnto the aforesaid place.</p>

<p>The other descendeth of two heads from Mapledour well, and goeth by
Skewes, Newenham, Rotherwijc, and yer it come at Hartlie, ioineth with
the Basing water, from whence they go togither to Turges, where they
méet with the Loddon (as I haue said alreadie.) The next streame toward
<span class="leftnote">Ditis vadum.</span>
the south is called Ditford brooke. It riseth not farre from Vpton, goeth
<span class="rightnote">Ikelus.</span>
by Gruell, and beneath Wharnborow castell receiueth the Ikell (comming
from a parke of the same denomination) from whence they go togither by
Maddingleie vnto Swalowfield, and so into the Loddon. In this voiage
<span class="page"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[Page 86]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Elueius.</span>
also the Loddon méeteth with the Elwie or Elueie that commeth from
Aldershare, not farre by west of Euersleie: and about Eluesham
<span class="rightnote">Ducus.</span>
likewise with another running from Dogmansfield named the Douke: and
<span class="leftnote">Erin.</span>
also the third not inferior to the rest comming from Erin, whose head is
in Surreie, and going by Ash becommeth a limit, first betwéene Surreie
and Hamshire; then betwéene Hamshire and Barkeshire, and passing by Ash,
Erinleie, Blacke water, Perleie, and Finchamsted; it ioineth at last
with the Ditford, before it come at Swalowfield. To conclude therefore
with our Loddon, hauing receiued all these waters; and after the last
confluence with them now being come to Loddon bridge, it passeth on by a
part of Wiltshire to Twiford bridge, then to Wargraue, and so into the
Thames that now is maruellouslie increased and growen vnto triple
greatnesse (to that it was at Oxford.)</p>

<p>Being therefore past Shiplake and Wargraue, it runneth by Horsependon,
or Harding: then to Henleie vpon Thames, where sometime a great rill
voideth it selfe in the same. Then to Remenham, Greneland (going all
this waie from Shiplake iust north, and now turning eastwards againe) by
Medenham, Hurlie, Bisham, Marlow the greater, Marlow the lesse, it
meeteth with a brooke soone after that consisteth of the water of two
<span class="leftnote">Vsa.</span>
rilles, whereof the one called the Vse, riseth about west Wickham, out
of one of the Chilterne hilles, and goeth from thence to east Wickham or
high Wickham, a pretie market towne. The other named Higden, descendeth
<span class="leftnote">Higden.</span>
also from those mounteines but a mile beneath west Wickham, and ioining
both in one at the last, in the west end of east Wickham towne, they go
togither to Wooburne, Hedsor, &amp; so into the Thames. Some call it the
Tide; and that word doo I vse in my former treatise: but to procéed.
After this confluence our Thames goeth on by Cowkham, Topleie,
Maidenhead, aliàs Sudlington, Braie, Dorneie, Clure, new Windsore
(taking in neuerthelesse, at Eaton by the waie, the Burne which riseth
out of a Moore, &amp; commeth thither by Burnham) old Windsor, Wraiborow,
and a little by east therof doth crosse the Cole, whereof I find this
short description insuing.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Colus, aliàs Vere and Vertume.</span>
The Cole riseth néere vnto Flamsted, from whence it goeth to Redburn, S.
Michaels, S. Albons, Aldenham, Watford, and so by More to Richmansworth,
where there is a confluence of three waters, of which this Cole is the
<span class="rightnote">Gadus.</span>
first. The second called Gadus riseth not farre from Ashridge, an house
or palace belonging to the prince: from whence it runneth to great
Gaddesdin, Hemsted, betwéene Kings Langleie, and Abbots Langleie, then
to Hunters, and Cashew bridges, and so to Richmanswoorth, receiuing by
the waie a rill comming from Alburie by northwest, to Northchurch,
Barkehamsted, and beneath Hemsted ioining with the same. The last
commeth in at northwest from aboue Chesham, by Chesham it selfe, then by
Chesham Bois, Latimers, Mawdlens, Cheinies, Sarret and Richmanswoorth,
and so going on all in one chanell vnder the name of Cole, it runneth to
Vxbridge, where it taketh in the Missenden water, from northwest, which
rising aboue Missenden the greater goeth by Missenden the lesse,
Hagmondesham (now Hammersham) the Vach, Chalfhunt Giles, Chalfhunt S.
Peters, Denham, and then into the Cole aboue Vxbridge (as I haue said.)
Soone after this our Cole doth part it selfe into two branches, neuer to
ioine againe before they come at the Thames, for the greater of them
goeth thorough the goodlie medows straight to Colebrooke, the other vnto
two milles, a mile and a halfe east of Colebrooke, in the waie to
London, leauing an Iland betwéene them of no small size and quantitie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Vindeles.</span>
Being past the Cole, we come to the fall of the Vindeles, which riseth
by northwest néere vnto Bagshot, from whence it goeth to Windlesham,
Chobham, and méeting with a brooklet comming westward from Bisleie, they
run togither toward Cherteseie, where when they haue met with a small
rill rising north of Sonning hill in Windlesoure great parke, it falleth
into the Thames on the northeast side of Cherteseie. When we were come
beyond this water, it was not long yer we came vnto another on the same
side, that fell into the Thames betweene Shepperton on the one side, and
<span class="leftnote">Veius.</span>
Oteland on the other, and is called the Waie. The Weie or the Waie
rising by west, commeth from Olsted, &amp; soone after taking the Hedleie
brooke withall (which riseth in Wulmere forrest, and goeth by Hedleie
<span class="page"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[Page 87]</span>
and Frensham) hasteth by Bentleie, Farnham, Alton, Waiberleie, Elsted,
<span class="rightnote">Thuresbie.</span>
and so to Pepper harrow, where it ioineth with the Thuresbie water,
which commeth not farre off from a village of the same denomination.
From hence also it goeth to Godalming, and then toward Shawford, but yer
it come there, it crosseth Craulie becke, which rising somewhere about
<span class="leftnote">Crawleie.</span>
the edge of Sussex short of Ridgewijc, goeth by Vacherie parke, Knoll,
Craulie, Bramleie, Wonarsh, and so into the Waie. From hence then our
<span class="leftnote">Abbinger.</span>
riuer goeth to Shawford, and soone after (méeting with the Abbinger
water that commeth by Shere, Albirie, and the chappell on the hill) it
proceedeth to Guldeford, thence to Stoke, Sutton in the parke, Send,
Woking, and at Newarke parke side taketh in a brooke that riseth of two
heads, whereof one dooth spring betwéene two hils north of Pepper
harrow, and so runneth through Henleie parke, the other aboue Purbright,
and afterward ioining in one, they go foorth vnto Newarke, and being
there vnited, after the confluence it goeth to Purford court, to Bifler,
Waifred, Oteland, and so into the Thames.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Molts.</span>
From Oteland the Thames goeth by Walton, Sunburie, west Moulseie,
Hampton, and yer it come at Hampton court on the northside, and east
Moulseie on the other, it taketh in the Moule water, which giueth name
vnto the two townes that stand on each side of the place, where it
falleth into our streame. It riseth in Word forrest, and going by
Burstow, it méeteth afterward with another gullet, conteining a small
course from two seuerall heads, whereof one is also in the forrest
aforenamed, the other runneth from Febush wood, and comming by Iseld,
méeteth with the first aboue Horleie, and so run on in one chanell, I
saie, till they ioine with the Moule water, whereof I spake before.</p>

<p>After this confluence in like sort, it is not long yer the Moule take in
another from by north, which commeth from about Mesham on the one side,
and another on the other side, running by Ocleie and Capell, and
whereinto also a branch or rill commeth from a wood on the northwest
part. Finallie, being thus increased with these manie rilles, it goeth
by east Becheworth, west Becheworth, and ouer against the Swalow on the
side of Drake hill, taking in another that c&#333;meth thither from
Wootton by Darking and Milton, it runneth to Mickleham, Letherhed,
Stoke, Cobham, Ashire parke, east Moulseie, and so into the Thames,
which after this coniunction goeth on to Kingston, and there also
méeteth with another becke, rising at Ewell south of Nonsuch. Certes,
this rill goeth from Ewell by the old parke, then to Mauldon, &amp; so to
Kingston towne. The Thames in like maner being past Kingston, goeth to
Tuddington, Petersham, Twickenham, Richmond, and Shene, where it
receiueth a water on the northwest side, which comming from about Harrow
on the hill, and by west of the same, goeth by Haies, Harlington,
Felthan, and Thistleworth into the Thames.</p>

<p>The next fall of water is at Sion, néere vnto new Brainford, so that it
<span class="leftnote">Brane.</span>
issueth into the Thames betwéen them both. This water is called Brane,
that is in the Brittish toong (as Leland saith) a frog. It riseth about
Edgeworth, and commeth from thence by Kingesburie, Twiford, Periuall,
Hanwell, and Austerleie. Thence we followed our riuer to old Brentford,
Mortlach, Cheswijc, Barnelmes, Fulham, and Putneie, beneath which townes
it crossed a becke from Wandlesworth, that riseth at Woodmans turne, and
going by Easthalton, méeteth another comming from Croidon by Bedington,
and so going on to Mitcham, Marton abbeie, and Wandlesworth, it is not
<span class="leftnote">Mariburne.</span>
long yer it fall into the Thames. Next vnto this is Mariburne rill on
the other side, which commeth in by S. Iames, so that by this time we
haue either brought the Thames, or the Thames conueied vs to London,
where we rested for a season to take view of the seuerall tides there,
of which each one differeth from other, by foure &amp; twentie minuts, that
is fortie eight in a whole daie, as I haue noted before, except the
wether alter them. Being past London, and in the waie toward the sea:
the first water that it méeteth withall, is the Brome on Kent side,
<span class="leftnote">Bromis.</span>
west of Gréenewich, whose head is Bromis in Bromleie parish, and going
from thence to Lewsham, it taketh in a water from by east, and so
directeth his course foorth right vnto the Thames.</p>

<p>The next water that it méeteth withall, is on Essex side, almost against
<span class="leftnote">Lée.</span>
Woolwich, and that is the Lée or Luie, whose head riseth short of
Kempton in Hertfordshire, foure miles southeast of Luton, sometime
<span class="page"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[Page 88]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Logus.</span>
called Logodunum or Logrodunum, &amp; going through a péece of Brokehall
parke (leauing Woodhall parke on the north, and Hatfield on the south,
with another parke adioining) it goeth toward Hartford towne. But yer it
<span class="rightnote">Marran.</span>
come there, it receiueth a water (peraduenture the Marran) rising at
northwest in Brodewater hundred, from aboue Welwin, northeast of
Digeswell, and going to Hartingfeld burie, where the said confluence
is within one mile of the towne. Beneath Hatfield also it receiueth the
<span class="leftnote">Beane.</span>
Beane (as I gesse) comming from Boxwood by Benington, Aston, Watton, and
Stapleford, and a little lower, the third arme of increase from aboue
Ware, which descendeth from two heads: whereof the greatest commeth from
Barkewaie in Edwinster hundred, the other Sandon in Oddesey hundred, and
after they be met beneath little Hornemeade, they go togither by
Pulcherchurch, or Puckrich, Stonden, Thunderidge, Wadesmill, Benghoo,
and so into the Lée, which from hence runneth on till it come at Ware,
which was drowned by the rage of the same 1408, and so to Amwell, where
on the north side it receiueth the water that commeth from little
Hadham, through a péece of Singleshall parke, then by great Hadham, and
so from Widford to the aforesaid towne. From hence also they go as one
to old Stansted called Le Veil, branching in such wise yer it come
there, that it runneth through the towne in sundrie places. Thence it
goeth foorth to Abbats Stansted, beneath which it méeteth with the
<span class="leftnote">Sturus.</span>
Stoure, west (as I remember) of Roidon. This Sture riseth at Wenden
lootes, from whence it goeth to Langleie, Clauering, Berden, Manhuden, &amp;
Birchanger (where it taketh a rill comming from Elsingham, &amp; Stansted
Mountfitchet.) Thence it hieth on to Bishops Stourford, Sabrichfoord,
and beneath this towne crosseth with another from the east side of
Elsingham, that goeth to Hatfield, Brodocke, Shiring, Harlo, &amp; so into
the Stoure, and from whence they go togither to Eastwic, Parmedon, and
next into the Lée. These things being thus performed, the Lée runneth on
beneath Hoddesdon, Broxburne, and Wormleie, where a water breaketh out
by west of the maine streame, a mile lower than Wormeleie it selfe, but
yet within the paroch, and is called Wormeleie locke.</p>

<p>It runneth also by Cheston nunrie, and out of this a little beneath the
said house, breaketh an arme called the Shirelake, bicause it diuideth
Eastsex and Hartford shire in sunder, and in the length of one medow
called Fritheie. This lake runneth not but at great flouds, and méeteth
againe with a succor of ditchwater, at a place called Hockesditch, halfe
a mile from his first breaking out, and halfe a mile lower at Marsh
point ioineth againe with the streame from whence it came before. Thence
commeth the first arme to S. Maulie bridge (the first bridge westward
vpon that riuer) vpon Waltham causie, &amp; halfe a mile lower than Maulie
bridge, at the corner of Ramnie mead, it méeteth with the kings streame
&amp; principall course of Luy, or Lee, as it is commonlie called. The
second arme breaketh out of the kings streame at Halifield halfe a mile
lower than Cheston nunrie, and so to the fulling mill, and two bridges
by west of the kings streame, wherinto it falleth about a stones cast
lower at a place called Malkins shelffe, except I was wrong informed.
Cheston &amp; Hartfordshire men doo saie, that the kings streame at Waltham
dooth part Hartfordshire and Essex, but the Essex men by forrest charter
doo plead their liberties to hold vnto S. Maulies bridge. On the east
side also of the kings streame breaketh out but one principall arme at
Halifield, three quarters of a mile aboue Waltham, &amp; so goeth to the
corne mill in Waltham, and then to the K. streame againe a little
beneath the kings bridge.</p>

<p>From hence the Lée runneth on by south on Waltonstow till it come to
Stretford Langthorne, where it brancheth partlie of it selfe, and partlie
<span class="leftnote">Alfred.</span>
by mans industrie for mils. Howbeit heerein the dealing of Alfred
(sometimes king of England) was not of smallest force, who vnderstanding
the Danes to be gotten vp with their ships into the countrie, there to
kill and slaie his subiects, in the yeere of grace 896, by the conduct
of this riuer: he in the meane time before they could returne, did so
mightilie weaken the maine chanell, by drawing great numbers of trenches
from the same; that when they purposed to come backe, there was nothing
so much water left as the ships did draw: wherefore being set on ground,
they were soone fired, &amp; the aduersaries ouercome. By this policie also
<span class="page"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[Page 89]</span>
much medow ground was woone, &amp; made firme land, whereby the countrie
about was not a little inriched, as was also a part of Assyria by the
like practise of Cyrus with the Ganges, at such time as he came against
Babylon, which riuer before time was in maner equall with Euphrates. For
he was so offended, that one of his knights whom he loued déerlie, was
drowned and borne awaie with the water in his passage ouer the same,
that he sware a deepe oth yer long to make it so shallow that it should
not wet a woman to the knées. Which came to passe, for he caused all his
armie to dig 46 new draines fr&#333; the same, wherby the vow that he had
made was at the full performed. Senec. de Tra. li. 3. But to conclude
with the Lee that somtime ouerflowed all those medowes, through which it
passeth (as for a great waie not inferior to the Thames) and I find that
being past Westham, it is not long yer it fall into that streame. One
thing I read more of this riuer before the conquest, that is, how Edward
the first, &amp; sonne of Alfred, in the yeare of grace 912, builded
Hartford towne: at which time also he had Wittham a towne in Essex in
hand, as his sister called Aelfled repaired Oxford &amp; London, and all
this foure yeares before the building of Maldon; of some called Hertford
or Herudford betweene three waters, that is, the Lée, the Benefuth, and
Memmarran, or rather Penmarran: but how these waters are distinguished
in these daies, as yet I cannot tell. It is possible, that the Bene may
be the same which commeth by Benington, and Benghoo: which if it be so,
then must the Memmarran be the same that descendeth from Whitwell, for
not farre from thence is Branfield, which might in time past right well
be called Marranfield, for of like inuersion of names I could shew manie
examples.</p>

<p>Being past the Lee (whose chanell is begun to be purged 1576, with
further hope to bring the same to the north side of London) we come vnto
<span class="leftnote">Rodon or Rodunus.</span>
the Rodon, vpon Essex side in like maner, and not verie farre (for foure
miles is the most) from the fall of the Lée. This water riseth at little
Canfield, from whence it goeth to great Canfield, high Roding, Eithorpe
Roding, Ledon Roding, White Roding, Beauchampe Roding, Fifeld, Shelleie,
high Ongar, and Cheping Ongar, where the Lauer falleth into it, that
<span class="leftnote">Lauer.</span>
ariseth betwixt Matching and high Lauer; and taking another rill withall
comming from aboue Northweld at Cheping Ongar, they ioine (I saie) with
the Rodon, after which confluence Leland coniectureth that the streame
<span class="leftnote">Iuelus.</span>
is called Iuell: for my part, I wot not what to say of it. But héerof I
am sure, that the whole course being past Ongar, it goeth to Stansted
riuers, Theidon mount, Heibridge, Chigwell, Woodford bridge, Ilford
bridge, Barking, &amp; so into the Thames.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Darwent.</span>
The Darwent méeteth with our said Thames vpon Kents side, two miles and
more beneath Erith. It riseth at Tanridge, or there abouts, as I haue
beene informed by Christopher Saxtons card late made of the same, and
the like (I hope) he will doo in all the seuerall shires of England at
the infinit charges of sir Thomas Sackford knight, &amp; maister of the
requests, whose zeale vnto his countrie héerin I cannot but remember, &amp;
so much the rather, for that he meaneth to imitate Ortelius, &amp; somewhat
beside this hath holpen me in the names of the townes, by which these
riuers for the Kentish part do run. Would to God his plats were once
finished for the rest! But to procéed. The Darwent therefore, rising at
Tanridge, goeth on by Titseie toward Brasted, and receiuing on ech side
of that towne (&amp; seuerall bankes) a riuer or rill, it goeth on to
Nockhold, Shorham, Kinsford, Horton, Darnhith, Dartford or Derwentford,
<span class="leftnote">Craie.</span>
&amp; there taking in the Craie on the left hand that coms from Orpington by
Marie Craie, Paules Craie, North Craie, and Craiford, it is not long yer
it fall into the Thames. But after I had once passed the fall of the
brooke, it is a world to sée what plentie of Serephium groweth vpon the
Kentish shore, in whose description Fuichsius hath not a little halted;
whilest he giueth foorth the hearbe Argentaria for Serephium, betwéene
which there is no maner of likelihood. This neuerthelesse is notable in
the said hearbe, that being translated into the garden, it receiueth
another forme cleane different from the first, which it yéelded when it
grew vpon the shore, and therevnto appeareth of more fat &amp; foggie
substance. Which maketh me to thinke that our physicians do take it for
a distinct kind of wormewood, whereof controuersie ariseth among them.
The next water that falleth into the Thames, is west of the Wauie Iles,
a rill of no great fame, neither long course, for rising about Coringham,
<span class="page"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[Page 90]</span>
it runneth not manie miles east and by south, yer it fall into the mouth
of this riuer, which I doo now describe.</p>

<p>I would haue spoken of one créeke that commeth in at Cliffe, and another
that runneth downe from Haltsto by S. Maries: but sith I vnderstand not
with what backewaters they be serued, I let them passe as not skilfull
of their courses. And thus much of the riuers that fall into the Thames,
wherein I haue doone what I maie, but not what I would for mine owne
satisfaction, till I came from the head to Lechlade, vnto which, as in
lieu of a farewell, I will ascribe that distichon which Apollonius
Rhodius writeth of the Thermodon:</p>

<p class="ind1">Huic non est aliud flumen par, nec tot in agros<br />
Vllum dimittit riuos quot fundit vtrinque.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Midwaie.</span>
Next vnto the Thames we haue the Midwaie water, whereof I find two
descriptions, the first beginneth thus. The Midwaie water is called in
Latine Medeuia (as some write) bicause the course therof is midwaie in a
manner betwéene London and Dorobernia, or (as we now call it)
Canturburie. In British it hight Dourbrée: and thereof Rochester was
sometime called Durobreuum. But in an old charter which I haue seene
(conteining a donation sometime made to the monasterie of saint Andrews
there by Ceadwalla) I find that the Saxons called this riuer Wedring;
and also a towne standing betweene Malling and east Farleie, Wedrington;
and finallie, a forrest also of the same denomination, Wedrington, now
Waterdon, wherby the originall name appeareth to be fetched from this
streame. It ariseth in Waterdon forrest east of Whetlin or Wedring, and
ioineth with another brooke that descendeth from Ward forrest in Sussex:
and after this confluence they go on togither, as one by Ashhirst, where
hauing receiued also the second brooke, it hasteth to Pensherst, and
there carrieth withall the Eden, that commeth from Lingfield parke.
After this it goeth to the southeast part of Kent, and taketh with it
<span class="leftnote">Frethus.</span>
the Frith or Firth, on the northwest side, and an other little streame
that commeth from the hilles betwéene Peuenburie and Horsemon on the
southeast. From thence also, and not farre from Yalling it receiueth the
<span class="leftnote">Theise.</span>
Theise (a pretie streame that ariseth about Theise Hirst) &amp; afterward
<span class="rightnote">Grane aliàs Cranus.</span>
the Gran or Crane, which hauing his head not farre from Cranbrooke, and
méeting with sundrie other riuelets by the waie, whereof one branch of
Theise is the last, for it parteth at the Twist, and including a pretie
Iland, doth ioine with the said Midwaie, a little aboue Yalding, and
then with the Lowse. Finallie at Maidstone it méeteth with another
brooke, whose name I know not, and then passeth by Allington, Duton,
Newhide, Halling, Cuckestane, Rochester, Chattham, Gillingham, Vpchurch,
Kingsferrie, and falleth into the maine sea betwéene Shepeie and the
Grane.</p>

<p>
And thus much out of the first authour, who commendeth it also, for that
in time past it did yéeld such plentie of sturgeon, as beside the kings
portion, and a due vnto the archbishop of Canturburie out of the same,
the deane and chapter of Rochester had no small allowance also of that
commoditie: likewise for the shrimps that are taken therein, which are
no lesse estéemed of in their kind, than the westerne smelts or
flounders taken in the Thames, &amp;c. The second authour describeth it
after this manner, and more copiouslie than the other.</p>
<p>
The cheefe head of this streame riseth in Waterdon forrest, from whence
after it hath runne a pretie waie still within the same, east of
Whetlin, it méeteth with a brooke, whose head is in Ward forrest,
southwest of Greenested, which goeth to Hartfield, and so to Whetlin,
and yer long ioineth with the Midwaie. After this confluence it is not
long yer it take in another by west from Cowden ward, and the third
aboue Pensherst, growing from two heads, whereof one is in Lingfield
parke, the other west of Crawherst; and ioining aboue Edinbridge, it
doth fall into the midwaie beneath Heuer towne, and Chiddingston. From
Pensherst our maine streame hasteth to Ligh, Tunbridge, and Twidleie,
and beneath the towne, it crosseth a water from North, whereof one head
is at the Mote, another at Wroteham, the third at west Peckham, &amp;
likewise another from southest, that runneth east of Capell. Next after
this it receiueth the These, whose forked head is at Theise Hirst, which
descending downe toward the north, taketh in not farre from Scotnie a
brooke out of the northside of Waterden forrest, whose name I find not,
<span class="page"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[Page 91]</span>
except it be the Dour. After this confluence our riuer goeth to
Goldhirst, and comming to the Twist, it brancheth in such wise, that one
part of it runneth into Midwaie, another into the Garan, or rather
<span class="leftnote">Garunus, Cranus.</span>
Cranebrooke (if my coniecture be anie thing.) The Garan (as Leland
calleth it) or the Crane (as I doo take it) riseth néere to Cranebrooke,
and going by Siffinghirst, it receiueth yer long one water that commeth
by Fretingdon, and another that runneth from great Chard by Smerdon, and
Hedcorne, crossing two rilles by the waie from by north, Hedcorne it
selfe standing betwéene them both. Finallie, the Garan or Crane meeting
with Midwaie south of Yalling, they on the one side, and the These on
the other, leaue a pretie Iland in the middest, of foure miles in
length, and two in breadth, wherein is some hillie soile, but neither
towne nor village, so farre as I remember.</p>

<p>From Yalling forward, the Midwaie goeth to west Farlegh, east Farlegh:
and yer it come at Maidstone, it interteineth a rill that riseth short
of Ienham, and goeth by Ledes and Otteringden, which is verie
beneficiall to clothiers in drie yéeres: for thither they conueie their
clothes to be thicked at the fulling milles, sometimes ten miles for the
same: there is also at Ledes great plentie of fulling earth, which is a
necessarie commoditie.</p>
<p>
Being past Maidstone, it runneth by Allington, Snodland, Halling,
Cuckstane, and Rochester, where it passeth vnder a faire bridge of
stone, with a verie swift course, which bridge was begun 1388 by the
lord Iohn Cobham, the ladie Margaret his wife, and the valiant sir
Robert Knolles, who gaue the first onset vpon that péece of worke, and
therevnto builded a chappell of the Trinitie at the end therof, in
testimonie of his pietie. In processe of time also one Iohn Warner of
Rochester made the new coping thereof; and archbishop Warham of
Canturburie the iron barres: the bishops also of that see were not
slacke in their beneuolence and furtherances toward that worke,
especiallie Walter Merton founder of Merton college in Oxford, who by
misfortune perished by falling from the same, as he rode to surueie the
workemen. Being past Rochester, this noble riuer goeth to Chatham,
Gillingham, Vpchurch, and soone after branching, it imbraceth the Greene
at his fall, as his two heads doo Ashdon forrest, that lieth betwéene
them both.</p>

<small>OF SUCH STREAMES AS FALL INTO THE SEA,
BETWEENE THE THAMES AND THE MOUTH<br /> OF THE SAUERNE.</small><br />

CHAP. XII.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">Stoure.</span>
After the Midwaie we haue the Stoure that riseth at Kingeswood, which is
<span class="rightnote"><br />Nailburne water also (as I heare) neer to Cantwarbirie,
but I wote not whereabouts: sée <em>Marianus Scotus</em>.</span>
fourtéene or fifteene miles from Canturburie. This riuer passeth by
Ashford, Wie, Nackington, Canturburie, Fordish, Standish, and
Sturemouth, where it receiueth another riuer growing of three branches.
After our Stoure or Sture parteth it self in twaine, &amp; in such wise,
that one arme therof goeth toward the north, and is called (when it
commeth at the sea) the north mouth of Stoure; the other runneth
southeastward vp to Richborow, and so to Sandwich, from whence it goeth
northeast againe and falleth into the sea. The issue of this later tract
is called the hauen of Sandwich. And peraduenture the streame that
commeth downe thither, after the diuision of the Stoure, maie be the
<span class="leftnote">Wantsome.</span>
same which Beda calleth Wantsome; but as I cannot vndoo this knot at
will, so this is certeine, that the Stoure on the one side, and
peraduenture the Wantsome on the other, parteth and cutteth the Tenet
from the maine land of Kent, whereby it is left for an Iland.</p>

<p>There are other little brookes which fall into the Stoure, whereof
Leland speaketh, as Fishpoole becke that ariseth in Stonehirst wood, and
meeteth with it foure miles from Canturburie: another beginneth at
Chislet, and goeth into the Stoure gut, which sometime inclosed Thanet,
as Leland saith: the third issueth out of the ground at Northburne
(where Eadbert of Kent sometime past held his palace) and runneth to
Sandwich hauen, as the said authour reporteth: and the fourth called
Bridgewater that riseth by S. Marie Burne church, and going by Bishops
<span class="page"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[Page 92]</span>
Burne, meeteth with Canturburie water at Stourmouth: also Wiham that
riseth aboue Wiham short of Adsam, and falleth into Bridgewater at
Dudmill, or Wenderton: and the third namelesse, which riseth short of
Wodensburgh (a towne wherein Hengist &amp; the Saxons honored their grand
idoll Woden, or Othine) and goeth by Staple to Wingam: but sith they are
obscure I will not touch them here. From hence passing by the Goodwine,
a plot verie perilous for sea-faring men (sometime firme land, that is,
vntill the tenth of the conquerours sonne, whose name was William Rufus,
and wherein a great part of the inheritance of erle Goodwine in time
past was knowne to lie) but escaping it with ease, we came at length to
<span class="leftnote">Dour.</span>
Douer. In all which voiage we found no streame, by reason of the cliffes
that inuiron the said coast. Howbeit vpon the south side of Douer, there
is a pretie fresh riuer, whose head ariseth at Erwell, not passing foure
miles from the sea, and of some is called Dour, which in the British
toong is a common name for waters, as is also the old British word Auon
for the greatest riuers, into whose mouthes or falles shippes might find
safe entrance; and therefore such are in my time called hauens, a new
word growen by an aspiration added to the old: the Scots call it Auen.
But more of this else-where, sith I am now onelie to speake of Dour,
wherof it is likelie that the towne &amp; castell of Douer did sometime take
the name. From hence we go toward the Camber (omitting peraduenture here
and there sundrie small creeks void of backwater by the waie)
<span class="leftnote">Rother.</span>
whereabouts the Rother a noble riuer falleth into the sea. This Rother
separateth Sussex from Kent, and hath his head in Sussex, not farre from
Argas hill néere to Waterden forrest, and from thence directeth his
course vnto Rotherfield. After this it goeth to Ethlingham or
Hitchingham, and so foorth by Newendon vnto Mattham ferrie, where it
diuideth it selfe in such wise, that one branch thereof goeth to
Appledoure (where is a castell sometime builded by the Danes, in the
time of Alfred, as they did erect another at Middleton, and the third at
<span class="leftnote">Bilie.</span>
Beamflete) and at this towne, where it méeteth the Bilie that riseth
about Bilsington, the other by Iden, so that it includeth a fine parcell
of ground called Oxneie, which in time past was reputed as a parcell of
Sussex; but now vpon some occasion or other (to me vnknowne) annexed
vnto Kent. From hence also growing into some greatnesse, it runneth to
<span class="leftnote">Becke.</span>
Rie, where it méeteth finallie with the Becke, which commeth from
Beckleie: so that the plot wherein Rie standeth, is in manner a by-land
or peninsula, as experience doth confirme. Leland and most men are of the
<span class="leftnote">Limenus.</span>
likeliest opinion, that this riuer should be called the Limen, which (as
Peter of Cornhull saith) doth issue out of Andredeswald, where the head
thereof is knowne to be. Certes, I am of the opinion, that it is called
the Rother vnto Appledoure, &amp; from thence the Limen, bicause the Danes
are noted to enter into these parts by the Limen; and sailing on the
same to Appledoure, did there begin to fortifie, as I haue noted
alreadie. Howbeit, in our time it is knowne by none other name than the
Rother or Appledoure water, whereof let this suffice.</p>

<p>Being thus crossed ouer to the west side of Rie hauen, &amp; in vewing the
issues that fall into the same, I meet first of all with a water that
groweth of two brookes, which come downe by one chanell into the east
side of the mouth of the said port. The first therfore that falleth into
it descendeth from Beckleie or thereabouts (as I take it) the next
runneth along by Pesemarsh, &amp; soone after ioining with all, they hold on
as one, till they fall into the same at the westerlie side of Rie: the
third streame commeth from the north, and as it mounteth vp not farre
from Munfield, so it runneth betweene Sescambe and Wacklinton néere vnto
Bread, taking another rill withall that riseth (as I heare) not verie
far from Westfield. There is likewise a fourth that groweth of two heads
betweene Ielingham and Pet, and going by Winchelseie it méeteth with all
about Rie hauen, so that Winchelseie standeth inuironed on thrée parts
with water, and the streames of these two that I haue last rehearsed.</p>

<p>The water that falleth into the Ocean, a mile by southwest of Hastings,
<span class="leftnote">Aestus.</span>
or therabouts, is called Æstus or Asten: perhaps of Hasten or Hasting
the Dane, (who in time past was a plague to France and England) &amp; rising
not far from Penhirst, it meeteth with the sea (as I heare) by east of
<span class="rightnote">Buluerhithe.</span>
Hollington. Buluerhith is but a creeke (as I remember) serued with no
<span class="page"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[Page 93]</span>
backewater; and so I heare of Codding or Old hauen, wherefore I meane
not to touch them.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Peuenseie.</span>
Into Peuenseie hauen diuerse waters doo resort, and of these, that which
entereth into the same on the east side riseth out from two heads,
<span class="leftnote"><br />Ash.<br />
Burne.</span>
whereof the most easterlie is called Ash, the next vnto the Burne, and
vniting themselues not farre from Ashburne, they continue their course
vnder the name and tide of Ashburne water, as I read. The second that
commeth thereinto issueth also of two heads, whereof the one is so manie
miles from Boreham, the other not far from the Parke east of
Hellingstowne, and both of them concurring southwest of Hirstmowsen,
they direct their course toward Peuenseie (beneath which they méet with
another rising at Foington) and thence go in one chanell for a mile or
<span class="leftnote">Cucomarus.</span>
more, till they fall togither into Peuenseie hauen. The Cuckmer issueth
out at seuerall places, and hereof the more easterlie branch commeth
from Warbleton ward, the other from Bishops wood, and méeting beneath
Halling, they run one bottome by Micham, Arlington, Wellington, old
Frithstan, and so into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Isis.<br />
Ni fallor.</span>
Vnto the water that commeth out at Newhauen, sundrie brookes and
riuerets doo resort, but the chiefe head riseth toward the west,
somewhat betwéene Etchinford and Shepleie, as I heare. The first water
therefore that falleth into the same on the east side, issueth out of
the ground about Vertwood, and running from thence by Langhton and Ripe,
on the west side; it falleth into the aforesaid riuer beneath Forle and
Glime, or thrée miles lower than Lewis, if the other buttall like you
not. The next herevnto hath his head in Argas hill, the third descendeth
from Ashedon forrest, and ioining with the last mentioned, they crosse
the maine riuer a little beneath Isefield. The fourth water commeth from
Ashedon forrest by Horstéed Caines (or Ousestate Caines) and falleth
into the same, likewise east of Linfield. Certes I am deceiued if this
riuer be not called Isis, after it is past Isefield. The fift riseth
<span class="leftnote">Sturewell.</span>
about Storuelgate, and meeteth also with the maine streame aboue
Linfield, and these are knowen to lie vpon the right hand as we rowed vp
the riuer. On the other side are onelie two, whereof the first hath his
originall neere vnto Wenefield, and holding on his course toward the
east, it meeteth with his maister betweene Newicke and Isefield (or
<span class="leftnote">Plimus.</span>
Ifield) as some read it. The last of all commeth from Plimodune or
Plumpton, and hauing met in like sort with the maine riuer about
Barcham, it runneth foorth with it, &amp; they rest in one chanell by
Barcham, Hamseie, Malling, Lewis, Piddingburne, and so foorth into the
maine.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Soru.</span>
The next riuer that we came vnto west of Brighthemston is the Sore,
which notwithstanding I find to be called Brember water, in the ancient
map of Marton colledge in Oxford: but in such sort (as I take it) as the
Rother or Limen is called Appledoure streame, bicause of the said towne
that standeth thervpon. But to procéed, it is a pleasant water, &amp;
thereto if you consider the situation of his armes, and branches from
the higher grounds, verie much resembling a foure stringed whip.
Whereabout the head of this riuer is, or which of these branches may
safelie be called Sora from the rising, in good sooth I cannot say. For
after we had passed nine or ten mils thereon vp into the land, suddenlie
the crosse waters stopped vs, so that we were inforced to turne either
east or west, for directlie foorth right we had no waie to go. The first
arme on the right hand as we went, riseth out of a parke by south of
Alborne, and going on for a certeine space toward the northwest, it
turneth southward betwéene Shermonburie and Twinham, and soone after
<span class="leftnote">Bimarus.</span>
méeteth with the Bimar, not much south from Shermonburie, whence they
run togither almost two miles, till they fall into the Sore. That on the
west side descendeth from about Billingeshirst, &amp; going toward the east,
it crosseth with the fourth (which riseth a litle by west of Thacam)
east from Pulborow, and so they run as one into the Sore, that after
this confluence hasteth it selfe southward by Brember, Burleis, the
Combes, and yer long into the Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Arunus.</span>
The Arun (of which beside Arundell towne the castell and the vallie
wherin it runneth is called Vallis Aruntina, or Arundale in English) is
a goodlie water, and thereto increased with no small number of excellent
&amp; pleasant brookes. It springeth vp of two heads, whereof one descendeth
from the north not far from Gretham, and going by Lis, méeteth with the
<span class="page"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[Page 94]</span>
next streame (as I gesse) about Doursford house. The second riseth by
west from the hils that lie toward the rising of the sunne from East
maine, and runneth by Peterfield. The third commeth from Beriton ward,
and ioineth with the second betwéene Peterfield and Doursford, after
which confluence they go togither in one chanell still toward the east
(taking a rill with them that c&#333;mmeth betwéene Fernehirst and S.
Lukes chappell, southwest of Linchmere, and meeting with it east of
Loddesworth (as I doo read, and likewise sundrie other in one chanell
beneath Stopham) to Waltham, Burie, Houghton, Stoke, Arundell,
Tortington ford, Climping (all on the west side) and so into the sea.</p>

<p>Hauing thus described the west side of Arun, let vs doo the like with
the other in such sort as we best may. The first riuer that we come vnto
therfore on the east side, and also the second, rise of sundrie places
in S. Leonards forrest, &amp; ioining a little aboue Horsham, they méet with
the third, which commeth from Ifield parke, not verie farre from
Slinfeld. The fourth hath two heads, whereof one riseth in Witleie
parke, the other by west, neere vnto Heselméere chappell, and meeting by
west of Doursfeld, they vnite themselues with the chanell, growing by
the confluence that I spake of beneath Slinfeld, a little aboue
Billingshirst. The last water commeth from the hils aboue Linchemere,
and runneth west and south, and passing betwéene Billingshirst and
Stopham it commeth vnto the chanell last mentioned, and so into the Arun
beneath Stopham, without anie further increase, at the least that I doo
heare of.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Burne.</span>
Burne hath his issue in a parke néere Aldingburrie (or rather a little
aboue the same toward the north, as I haue since beene informed) and
running by the bottomes toward the south, it falleth betwéene north
<span class="leftnote">Elin.</span>
Berflete and Flesham. Erin riseth of sundrie heads, by east of Erinleie,
and directing his course toward the sunne rising, it peninsulateth
<span class="leftnote">Del&#363;s.</span>
Seleseie towne on the southwest and Pagham at northwest. Deel springeth
about Benderton, and thence running betwéene middle Lauant and east
Lauant, it goeth by west of west Hampnet, by east of Chichester, or west
of Rumbaldesdowne, and afterward by Fishburne, where it meeteth with a
rill comming north west from Funtingdon (a little beneath the towne) &amp;
then running thus in one streame toward the sea, it méeteth with another
rillet comming by north of Bosham, and so into Auant gulfe by east of
Thorneie Iland.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Racunus.</span>
The Racon riseth by east of Racton or Racodunum (as Leland calleth it)
and comming by Chidham, it falleth into the sea, northeast of Thorneie
<span class="leftnote"><br />Emill.</span>
aforesaid. The Emill commeth first betwéene Racton and Stansted, then
downe to Emilsworth or Emmesworth, &amp; so vnto the Ocean, separating
Sussex from Hampshire almost from the very head. Hauing in this maner
passed along the coasts of Sussex, the next water that I remember,
riseth by east of the forrest of Estbirie, from whence it goeth by
Southwike, west Burhunt, Farham, and so into the gulfe almost full
<span class="leftnote">Badunus forte.</span>
south. Then come we to Bedenham creeke (so called of a village standing
thereby) the mouth whereof lieth almost directlie against Porchester
castell, which is situat about three miles by water from Portesmouth
towne, as Leland dooth report. Then go we within halfe a mile further
<span class="leftnote">Forten or Fordon.</span>
to Forten creeke, which either giueth or taketh name of a village hard
<span class="rightnote">Osterpoole.</span>
by. After this we come to Osterpoole lake, a great créeke, that goeth vp
by west into the land, and lieth not far from a round turret of stone,
from whence also there goeth a chaine to another tower on the east side
directlie ouer against it, the like whereof is to be séene in diuerse
other hauens of the west countrie, wherby the entrance of great vessels
into that part may be at pleasure restreined.</p>

<p>From hence we go further to Tichefeld water, that riseth about Eastmaine
<span class="leftnote">Tichefield.</span>
parke, ten or twelue miles by northeast or there abouts from Tichefeld.
From Eastmaine it goeth (parting the forrests of Waltham, and Eastberie
by the way) to Wicham or Wicombe, a pretie market towne &amp; large
throughfare, where also the water separateth it selfe into two armelets,
and going vnder two bridges of wood commeth yer long againe vnto one
chanell. From hence it goeth three or foure miles further, to a bridge
of timber by maister Writhoseleies house (leauing Tichfeld towne on the
right side) and a little beneath runneth vnder Ware bridge, whither the
sea floweth as hir naturall course inforceth. Finallie, within a mile of
<span class="page"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[Page 95]</span>
this bridge it goeth into the water of Hampton hauen, whervnto diuerse
streames resort, as you shall heare hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Hamelrish.</span>
After this we come to Hamble hauen, or Hamelrish créeke, whose fall is
betwéene saint Andrewes castell, and Hoke. It riseth about Shidford in
Waltham forrest, &amp; when it is past Croke bridge, it méeteth with another
brooke, which issueth not farre from Bishops Waltham, out of sundrie
springs in the high waie on Winchester, from whence it passeth (as I
said) by Bishops Waltham, then to Budeleie or Botleie, and then ioining
with the Hamble, they run togither by Prowlingsworth, Vpton, Brusill,
Hamble towne, and so into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Southhampton.</span>
Now come we to the hauen of Southhampton, by Ptolomie called Magnus
portus, which I will briefelie describe so néere as I can possiblie. The
bredth or entrie of the mouth hereof (as I take it) is by estimation two
miles from shore to shore. At the west point therof also is a strong
castell latelie builded, which is rightlie named Caldshore, but now
Cawshot, I wote not by what occasion. On the east side thereof also is a
place called Hoke (afore mentioned) or Hamell hoke; wherein are not
aboue thrée or foure fisher houses, not worthie to be remembred. This
hauen shooteth vp on the west side by the space of seuen miles, vntill
it come to Hampton towne, standing on the other side, where it is by
estimation a mile from land to land. Thence it goeth vp further about
thrée miles to Redbridge, still ebbing and flowing thither, and one mile
further, so farre as my memorie dooth serue mée. Now it resteth that I
describe the Alresford streame, which some doo call the Arre or Arle,
and I will procéed withall in this order following.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Alresford.</span>
The Alresford beginneth of diuerse faire springs, about a mile or more
fr&#333; Alresford, or Alford as it is now called, and soone after
resorting to one bottome, they become a broad lake, which for the most
part is called Alford pond. Afterward returning againe to a narrow
chanell, it goeth through a stone bridge at the end of Alford towne
(leauing the towne it selfe on the left hand) toward Hicthingstocke
thrée miles off, but yer it commeth there, it receiueth two rils in one
bottome, whereof one commeth from the Forrest in maner at hand, and by
northwest of old Alresford, the other fr&#333; Browne Candiuer, that goeth
by Northenton, Swarewotton, Aberstone, &amp;c: vntill we méet with the said
water beneath Alford towne. Being past Hichinstocke, it commeth by
Auington to Eston village, and to Woorthie, where it beginneth to
branch, and ech arme to part it selfe into other that resort to Hide and
the lower soiles by east of Winchester, there seruing the stréets, the
close of S. Maries, Wolueseie, and the new college verie plentifullie
with their water. But in this meane while, the great streame commeth
from Worthie to the east bridge, and so to saint Elizabeth college,
where it dooth also part in twaine, enuironing the said house in most
delectable maner. After this it goeth toward S. Crosses, leauing it a
quarter of a mile on the right hand: then to Twiford (a mile lower)
where it gathereth againe into one bottome, and goeth six miles further
<span class="leftnote">Otter.</span>
to Woodmill, taking the Otter brooke withall on the east side, and so
into the salt créeke that leadeth downe to the hauen.</p>

<p>On the other side of Southhampton, there resorteth into this hauen also
<span class="leftnote">Stocke.</span>
both the Test &amp; the Stockbridge water in one bottome, whereof I find
this large description insuing. The verie head of the Stockewater, is
supposed to be somewhere about Basing stoke, or church Hockleie, and
going from thence betwéene Ouerton and Steuenton, it commeth at last by
Lauerstocke &amp; Whitchurch, and soone after receiuing a brooke by
<span class="leftnote">Bourne.</span>
northwest, called the Bourne (descending from S. Marie Bourne, southeast
from Horsseburne) it procéedeth by Long paroch and the wood, till it
meet with the Cranburne, on the east side (a pretie riuelet rising about
Michelneie, and going by Fullington, Barton, and to Cramburne) thence to
Horwell in one bottome, beneath which it meeteth with the Andeuer water,
that is increased yer it come there by an other brooke, whose name I doo
not know. This Andeuer streame riseth in Culhamshire forrest, not far by
north from Andeuer towne, and going to vpper Clatford, yer it touch
there it receiueth the rill of which I spake before, which rising also
néere vnto Anport, goeth to Monketon, to Abbatesham, the Andeuer, and
both (as I said) vnto the Test beneath Horwell, whereof I spake euen
now.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[Page 96]</span></p>

<p>These streames being thus brought into one bottome, it runneth toward
the south vnder Stockbridge, and soone after diuiding it selfe in
twaine, one branch thereof goeth by Houghton, &amp; a little beneath meeteth
with a rill, that commeth from bywest of S. Ans hil, and goeth by east
of vpper Wallop, west of nether Wallop, by Bucholt forrest, Broughton,
<span class="leftnote">Valopius.</span>
and called (as I haue béene informed) the Gallop, but now it is named
Wallop. The other arme runneth through the parke, by north west of kings
Somburne, and vniting themselues againe, they go forth by Motteshunt, and
<span class="leftnote">Test.</span>
then receiue the Test, a pretie water rising in Clarendun parke, that
goeth by west Deane, and east Deane, so to Motteshunt, and finallie to
the aforesaid water, which from thencefoorth is called the Test, euen
vnto the sea. But to procéed. After this confluence, it taketh the gate
to Kimbebridge, then to Rumseie, Longbridge, and beneath the same
receiueth a concourse of two rilles whereof the one commeth from
Sherefield, the other from the new Forrest, and ioining in Wadeleie
parke, they beat vpon the Test, not verie farre from Murseling. From
thence the Test goeth vnder a pretie bridge, before it come at
Redbridge, from whence it is not long yer it fall into the hauen.</p>

<p>The next riuer that runneth into this port, springeth in the new
<span class="leftnote">Eling.</span>
Forrest, and commeth thereinto about Eling, not passing one mile by west
of the fall of Test. From hence casting about againe into the maine sea,
and leauing Calde shore castell on the right hand, we directed our
course toward the southwest, vnto Beaulieu hauen, whereinto the Mineie
<span class="leftnote">Mineie.</span>
descendeth. The Mineie riseth not far from Mineiestéed, a village in the
north part of the new Forrest; and going by Beaulieu, it falleth into
the sea southwest (as I take it) of Exburie, a village standing vpon the
shore.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Limen.</span>
Being past the Mineie, we crossed the Limen as it is now called, whose
head is in the verie hart of the new Forrest (sometime conuerted into a
place of nourishment for déere by William Rufus, buieng his pleasure
with the ruine of manie towns and villages, as diuerse haue inclosed or
inlarged their parks by the spoile of better occupiengs) &amp; running
southwest of Lindhirst &amp; the parke, it goeth by east of Brokenhirst,
west of Bulder, &amp; finallie into the sea south and by east of Lemington.
I take this not to be the proper name of the water, but of the hauen,
for Limen in Gréeke is an hauen: so that Limendune is nothing else, but
a downe or higher plot of ground lieng on the hauen: neuerthelesse, sith
this denomination of the riuer hath now hir frée passage, I think it not
conuenient to séeke out any other name that should be giuen vnto it. The
next fall that we passed by is namelesse, except it be called Bure, &amp; as
<span class="leftnote">Bure.<br />Milis.</span>
it descendeth from new Forrest, so the next vnto it hight Mile, as I
haue heard in English. Certes the head thereof is also in the southwest
part of the said Forrest, &amp; the fall not far from Milford bridge, beyond
the which I find a narrow going or strictland leading fr&#333; the point
to Hirst castell which standeth into the sea, as if it hoong by a thred,
from the maine of the Iland, readie to be washed awaie by the continuall
working and dailie beating of the waues.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Auon.</span>
The next riuer that we came vnto of anie name is the Auon, which (as
Leland saith) riseth by northeast, and not far from Woolfehall in
Wiltshire, supposed to be the same which Ptolomie called Halenus. The
first notable bridge that it runneth vnto,is at Vphauen, thence foure
miles further it goeth to little Ambresburie, and there is another
bridge, from thence to Woodford village, standing at the right hand
banke, and Newton village on the left. The bishops of Sarum had a proper
manor place at Woodford, which bishop Sharton pulled downe altogither,
bicause it was somewhat in ruine. Thence it goeth to Fisherton bridge,
to Cranebridge, old Salisburie, new Salisburie, and finallie to Harnham,
which is a statelie bridge of stone, of six arches at the least. There
is at the west end of the said bridge, a little Iland, that lieth
betwixt this and another bridge, of foure pretie arches, and vnder this
later runneth a good round streame, which (as I take it) is a branch of
Auon, that breaketh out a little aboue, &amp; soone after it reuniteth it
selfe againe: or else that Wilton water hath there his entrie into the
Auon, which I cannot yet determine. From Harneham bridge it goeth to
Dounton, that is about foure miles, and so much in like sort from thence
to Fordingbridge, to Ringwood bridge fiue miles, to Christes church
Twinham fiue miles, and streight into the sea; and hitherto Leland of
<span class="page"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[Page 97]</span>
this streame, which for the worthinesse thereof (in mine opinion) is not
sufficientlie described. Wherefore I thinke good to deliuer a second
receiued of another, which in more particular maner dooth exhibit his
course vnto vs.</p>

<p>Certes this Auon is a goodlie riuer, rising (as I said before néere)
vnto Wolfe hall; although he that will séeke more scrupulouslie for the
head in déed, must looke for the same about the borders of the forrest
of Sauernake (that is Soure oke) which lieth as if it were imbraced
betwéene the first armes thereof, as I haue beene informed. These heads
also doo make a confluence by east of Martinshall hill, and west of
Wootton. From whence it goeth to Milton, Powseie, Manningfield abbeie,
Manningfield crosse, and beneath Newington taketh in one rill west from
Rudborow, and another a little lower that riseth also west of
Alcanninges, and runneth into the same by Patneie, Merden, Wilford,
Charleton, and Rustisall. Being therefore past Newington, it goeth to
Vphauen (whereof Leland speaketh) to Chesilburie, Compton, Ablington,
little Almsburie, Darntford, Woodford, old Salisburie, and so to new
Salisburie, where it receiueth one notable riuer from by northwest, &amp;
another from north east, which two I will first describe, leauing the
<span class="leftnote">Wilugh.</span>
Auon at Salisburie for a while. The first of these is called the Wilugh,
whereof the whole shire dooth take hir name, and not of the great
plentie of willowes growing therein, as some fantasticall heads doo
imagine: whereof also there is more plentie in that countrie than is to
be found in other places. It riseth among the Deuerels, and running
thence by hill Deuerell, &amp; Deuerell long bridge, it goeth toward Bishops
straw, taking in one rill by west &amp; another from Vpton by Werminster at
northwest. From Bishops straw it goeth to Norton, Vpton, Badhampton,
Steplinford, and Stapleford, where it meeteth with the Winterburie water
from by north, descending from Maddenton by Winterburne. From Stapleford
it hasteth to Wishford, Newton, Chilhampton, Wilton: and thither commeth
a water vnto it from southwest, which riseth of two heads aboue
Ouerdonet. After this it goeth by Wordcastell, to Tisburie, and there
receiueth a water on ech side, whereof one commeth from Funthill, the
other from two issues (of which one riseth at Austie, the other at
Swalodise) and so keeping on still with his course, our Wilugh runneth
next of all by Sutton. Thence it goeth to Fouant, Boberstocke,
<span class="leftnote">Nader becke.</span>
Southburcombe, Wilton (where it taketh in the Fomington or Nader water)
Westharnam, Salisburie, and Eastharnam: and this is the race of Wilugh.</p>

<p>The other is a naked arme or streame without anie branches. It riseth
aboue Colingburne Kingston in the hils, and thence it goeth to
Colingburne, the Tidworths (whereof the more southerlie is in Wiltshire)
Shipton, Cholterton, Newton, Toneie, Idmerson, Porton, the Winterburns,
Lauerstocke, and so into Auon east of Salisburie. And thus is the
confluence made of the aforesaid waters, with this our second Auon,
<span class="leftnote">Becquith brooke.</span>
whereinto another water falleth (called Becquithes brooke) a mile
beneath Harneham bridge, whose head is fiue miles from Sarum, and thrée
miles aboue Becquithes bridge, as Leland doth remember, who noteth the
<span class="leftnote">Chalkeburne.</span>
Chalkeburne water to haue his due recourse also at this place into the
aforesaid riuer. Certes it is a pretie brooke, and riseth six miles from
Shaftesburie, and in the waie toward Salisburie in a bottome on the
right hand, whence it commeth by Knighton and Fennistratford, to
Honington, that is about twelue miles from the head, and about two miles
and an halfe from Honington beneath Odstocke, goeth into the Auon, a
mile lower than Harnham bridge, except he forget himselfe. This Harnham,
whereof I now intreat, was sometime a pretie village before the erection
of new Salisburie, and had a church of S. Martine belonging vnto it, but
now in stéed of this church, there is onelie a barne standing in a verie
low mead on the northside of S. Michaels hospitall. The cause of the
relinquishing of it was the moistnesse of the soile, verie oft
ouerflowne. And whereas the kings high waie laie sometime through
Wilton, licence was obteined of the king and Richard bishop of
Salisburie, to remooue that passage vnto new Salisburie in like maner,
and vpon this occasion was the maine bridge made ouer Auon at Harneham.
<span class="rightnote">Thrée towns decaied by changing one waie.</span>
By this exchange of the waie also old Salisburie fell into vtter decaie,
&amp; Wilton which was before the head towne of the shire, and furnished
with twelue parish churches, grew to be but a poore village, and of
<span class="page"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[Page 98]</span>
small reputation. Howbeit, this was not the onelie cause of the ruine of
old Salisburie, sith I read of two other, whereof the first was a salue
vnto the latter, as I take it. For whereas it was giuen out, that the
townesmen wanted water in old Salisburie, it is flat otherwise; sith
that hill is verie plentifullie serued with springs and wels of verie
swéet water. The truth of the matter therefore is this.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">An holie conflict.</span>
In the time of ciuill warres, the souldiors of the castell and chanons
of old Sarum fell at ods, insomuch that after often bralles, they fell
at last to sad blowes. It happened therefore in a rogation weeke that
the cleargie going in solemne procession, a controuersie fell betwéene
them about certeine walkes and limits, which the one side claimed and
the other denied. Such also was the hot intertainment on ech part, that
at the last the Castellanes espieng their time, gate betwéene the
cleargie and the towne, and so coiled them as they returned homeward,
that they feared anie more to gang about their bounds for the yeare.
Héerevpon the people missing their bellie cheare (for they were woont to
haue banketing at euerie station, a thing commonlie practised by the
religious in old time, wherewith to linke in the commons vnto them, whom
anie man may lead whither he will by the bellie, or as Latimer said,
with beefe, bread and beere) they conceiued foorthwith a deadlie hatred
against the Castellans. But not being able to cope with them by force of
armes, they consulted with Richard Pore their bishop, and he with them
so effectuallie, that it was not long yer they, I meane the chanons,
began a new church vpon a péece of their owne ground called Mirifield,
pretending to serue God there in better safetie, and with far more
<span class="leftnote">New Salisburie begun.</span>
quietnesse than they could doo before. This church was begun 1219, the
nine and twentith of Aprill, and finished with the expenses of 42000
marks, in the yeare 1260, and fiue &amp; twentith of March, whereby it
appeereth that it was aboue fortie yéers in hand, although the clearks
were translated to the new towne 1220, or the third yeere after the
fraie. The people also séeing the diligence of the chanons, and reputing
their harmes for their owne inconuenience, were as earnest on the other
side to be néere vnto these prelats, and therefore euerie man brought
his house vnto that place, &amp; thus became old Sarum in few yeeres
vtterlie desolate, and new Salisburie raised vp in stéed thereof, to the
great decaie also of Harnham and Wilton, whereof I spake of late.
Neuerthelesse it should séeme to me that this new citie is not
altogither void of some great hinderances now and then by water: for in
the second of Edward the second (who held a parlement there) there was a
sudden thaw after a great frost, which caused the waters so fast to
arise, that euen at high masse time the water came into the minster, and
not onelie ouerflowed the nether part of the same, but came vp all to
the kings pauase where he sate, whereby he became wetshod, and in the
end inforced to leaue the church, as the executour did his masse, least
they should all haue béene drowned: and this rage indured there for the
space of two daies, wherevpon no seruice could be said in the said
minster.</p>

<p>Now to returne againe from whence I thus digressed. Our Auon therefore
departing from Salisburie, goeth by Burtford, Longford, and taking in
the waters afore mentioned by the waie, it goeth by Stanleie, Dunketon,
Craiford, Burgate, Fording bridge, Ringwood, Auon, Christes church; and
finallie into the sea. But yer it come all there &amp; a litle beneth
<span class="leftnote">Sturus.</span>
Christes church, it crosseth the Stoure or Sture, a verie faire streame,
whose course is such as may not be left vntouched. It riseth of six
heads, whereof thrée lie on the north side of the parke at Sturton
within the pale, the other rise without the parke; &amp; of this riuer the
towne and baronie of Sturton dooth take his name as I gesse, for except
my memorie do too much faile me, the lord Sturton giueth the six heads
of the said water in his armes. But to procéed. After these branches are
conioined in one bottome, it goeth to long Laime mill, Stilton, Milton,
and beneath Gillingham receiueth a water that descendeth from Mere.
Thence the Sture goeth to Bugleie, Stoure, Westouer bridge, Stoure
<span class="leftnote">Cale.</span>
prouost, and yer long it taketh in the Cale water, from Pen that commeth
downe by Wickhampton to Moreland, &amp; so to Stapleford, seuen miles from
Wickhampton, passing in the said voiage, by Wine Caunton, and the fiue
bridges. After this confluence, it runneth to Hinton Maries, and soone
<span class="rightnote">Lidden.<br />
Deuilis.</span>
after crosseth the Lidden and Deuilis waters all in one chanell, whereof
the first riseth in Blackemore vale, and goeth to the bishops Caundell:
<span class="page"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[Page 99]</span>
the second in the hils south of Pulham, and so runneth to Lidlinch; the
<span class="rightnote"><br />Iber.</span>
third water issueth néere Ibberton, and going by Fifehed to Lidlington,
<span class="leftnote"><br />Blackewater.</span>
and there méeting with the Lidden, they receiue the Blackewater aboue
Bagburne, and so go into the Stoure.</p>

<p>After this the Stoure runneth on to Stoureton minster, Fitleford,
Hammond, and soone after taking in one water that commeth from Hargraue
by west Orchard, and a second from Funtmill, it goeth on to Chele,
Ankeford, Handford, Durweston, Knighton, Brainston, Blandford,
Charleton: and crossing yer long a rill that riseth about Tarrent, and
goeth to Launston, Munketon, Caunston, Tarrant, it proceedeth foorth by
Shepwijc, and by and by receiuing another brooke on the right hand, that
riseth about Strictland, and goeth by Quarleston, Whitchurch, Anderston,
and Winterburne, it hasteth forward to Stoureminster, Berford lake, Alen
bridge, Winburne, aliàs Twinburne minster, whither commeth a water
called Alen (from Knolton, Wikehampton, Estambridge, Hinton, Barnsleie)
which hath two heads, whereof one riseth short of Woodcotes, and east of
Farneham, named Terig, the other at Munketon aboue S. Giles Winburne,
and going thence to S. Giles Ashleie, it taketh in the Horton becke, as
the Horton dooth the Cranburne. Finallie, meeting with the Terig aboue
Knolton, they run on vnder the name of Alen to the Stoure, which goeth
to the Canfords, Preston, Kingston, Perleie, and Yolnest: but yer it
<span class="leftnote">This Stoure aboundeth with pike, perch, roch,
dace, gudgeon and éeles.</span>
come at Yolnest it taketh in two brookes in one bottome, whereof one
commeth from Woodland parke by Holt parke, and Holt, another from aboue
vpper Winburne, by Edmondesham, Vertwood, and Mannington, and ioining
about S. Leonards, they go to Hornebridge, and so into Stoure. After
which confluence, the said Stoure runneth by Iuor bridge, and so into
Auon, leauing Christs church aboue the méeting of the said waters (as I
haue said before.)</p>
<p>
Hauing in this maner passed Christes church head we come to the fall of<span class="leftnote">Burne.</span>
the Burne, which is a little brooke running from Stourefield heath,
without branches; from whence we proceeded: &amp; the next fall that we come
<span class="leftnote">Poole.</span>
vnto is Poole, from whose mouth vpon the shore, by southwest in a baie
of thrée miles off, is a poore fisher towne called Sandwich, where we
saw a péere and a little fresh brooke. The verie vtter part of saint
Adelmes point, is fiue miles from Sandwich. In another baie lieth west
Lilleworth, where (as I heare) is some profitable harborough for ships.
The towne of Poole is from Winburne about foure miles, and it standeth
almost as an Ile in the hauen. The hauen it selfe also, if a man should
measure it by the circuit, wanteth little of twentie miles, as I did
gesse by the view.</p>

<p>Going therefore into the same, betwéene the north and the south points,
to sée what waters were there, we left Brunkeseie Iland, and the castell
on the left hand within the said points; and passing about by Pole, and
leauing that créeke, bicause it hath no fresh, we came by Holton and
Kesworth, where we beheld two falles, of which one was called the north,
<span class="leftnote">Piddle.</span>
the other the south waters. The north streame hight Piddle as I heare.
It riseth about Alton, and goeth from thence to Piddle trench head,
<span class="leftnote">Deuils.</span>
Piddle hinton, Walterstow, and yer it come at Birstam, receiueth Deuils
brooke that commeth thither from Brugham and Melcombe by Deuilish towne.
Thence it goeth to Tow piddle, Ashe piddle, Turners piddle (taking in
yer it come there, a water that runneth from Helton by Middleton,
Milburne &amp; Biere) then to Hide, and so into Pole hauen, and of this
water Marianus Scotus speaketh, except I be deceiued. The south water
<span class="leftnote">Frome.</span>
is properlie called Frome for Frame. It riseth néere vnto Euershot, and
going downe by Fromequitaine, Chelmington, and Catstocke, it receiueth
there a rill from beside Rowsham, and Wraxehall. After this it goeth on
<span class="leftnote">Ocus.</span>
to Chilfrome, and thence to Maden Newton, where it méeteth with the
Owke, that riseth either two miles aboue Hoke parke at Kenford, or in
the great pond within Hoke parke, and going by the Tollards, falleth
into the Frome about Maden Newton, &amp; so go as one from thence to
Fromevauchirch, Crokewaie, Frampton, and Muckilford, and receiueth néere
vnto the same a rill from aboue Vpsidling by S. Nicholas Sidling, and
Grimston. From hence it goeth on by Stratton and Bradford Peuerell, and
<span class="leftnote">Silleie.<br />
Minterne.<br />
Cherne.</span>
beneath this Bradford, it crosseth the Silleie aliàs Minterne and Cherne
brooks both in one chanell: whereof the first riseth in vpper Cherne
parish, the other at Minterne, and méeting aboue middle Cherne, they go
<span class="page"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[Page 100]</span>
by nether Cherne, Forston, Godmanston, and aboue Charneminster into
Frome. In the meane time also our Frome brancheth and leaueth an Iland
aboue Charneminster, and ioining againe néere Dorchester, it goeth by
Dorchester, and Forthington; but yer it come at Beckington, it méeteth
with another Becke that runneth thereinto from Winterburne, Stapleton,
Martinstow, Heringstow, Caine and Stafford, and from thence goeth
without anie further increase as yet to Beckington, Knighton, Tinkleton,
Morton, Wooll, Bindon, Stoke, &amp; beneath Stoke receiueth the issue of the
<span class="leftnote">Luckford.</span>
Luckford lake, from whence also it passeth by Eastholme, Warham, and so
<span class="leftnote"><br />Séeke more for Wilie brooke that goeth by
West burie to Pole hauen.</span>
into the Baie. From this fall we went about the arme point by Slepe,
where we saw a little créeke, then by Owre, where we beheld an other, &amp;
then comming againe toward the entrance by saint Helens, and Furleie
castell, we went abroad into the maine, and found ourselues at libertie.</p>

<p>When we were past Pole hauen, we left the Handfast point, the Peuerell
point, S. Adelmes chappell, and came at last to Lughport hauen, whereby
and also the Luckeford lake, all this portion of ground last remembred,
is left in maner of a byland or peninsula, and called the Ile of
Burbecke, wherein is good store of alum and hard stone. In like sort
going still westerlie, we came to Sutton points, where is a créeke. Then
vnto Waie or Wilemouth, by kings Welcombe, which is twentie miles from
Pole, and whose head is not full foure miles aboue the hauen by
northwest at Vphill in the side of a great hill. Hereinto when we were
entred, we saw three falles, whereof the first and greatest commeth from
Vpweie by Bradweie, and Radipoole, receiuing afterward the second that
ran from east Chekerell, and likewise the third that maketh the ground
betwéene Weimouth and Smalmouth passage almost an Iland. There is a
little barre of sand at the hauen mouth, and a great arme of the sea
runneth vp by the right hand; and scant a mile aboue the hauen mouth on
the shore, is a right goodlie and warlike castell made, which hath one
open barbicane. This arme runneth vp also further by a mile as in a
baie, to a point of land where a passage is into Portland, by a little
course of pibble sand. It goeth vp also from the said passage vnto
Abbatsbirie about seauen miles off, where a litle fresh rondell
resorteth to the sea. And somewhat aboue this, is the head or point of
<span class="leftnote">Chesill.</span>
the Chesill lieng northwest, which stretcheth vp from thence about
seauen miles, as a maine narrow banke, by a right line vnto the
southeast, and there abutteth vpon Portland scant a quarter of a mile
aboue the Newcastle there. The nature of this banke is such, that so
often as the wind bloweth vehementlie at southeast, so often the sea
beateth in, and losing the banke soketh through it: so that if this wind
should blow from that corner anie long time togither, Portland should be
left an Iland as it hath béene before. But as the southwest wind dooth
appaire this banke, so a northwest dooth barre it vp againe. It is
pretie to note of the Townelet of Waimouth, which lieth streight against
Milton on the other side, and of this place where the water of the hauen
is but of small breadth, that a rope is commonlie tied from one side of
the shore to another, whereby the ferrie men doo guide their botes
without anie helpe of Ores. But to procéed with our purpose. Into the
mouth of this riuer doo ships often come for succour.</p>

<p>Going by Portland and the point thereof called the Rase, we sailed along
by the Shingle, till we came by saint Katharins chappell, where we saw
the fall of a water that came downe from Blackdéene Beaconward, by
Portsham and Abbatsburie. Thence we went to another that fell into the
sea, neere Birton, and descended from Litton by Chilcombe, then vnto the
<span class="leftnote">Bride.</span>
Bride or Brute port, a pretie hauen, and the riuer it selfe serued with
<span class="leftnote"><br />Nature hath set the mouth of this riuer in maner betwixt
two hils, so that a little cost would make an hau&#275; there.</span>
sundrie waters. It riseth halfe a mile or more aboue Bemister, and so goeth
from Bemister to Netherburie by Parneham, then to Melplash, and so to Briteport,
where it taketh in two waters from by east in one chanell, of which one riseth
east of Nettlecort, and goeth by Porestoke and Milton, the other at
Askerwell, and runneth by Longlether. From hence also our Bride going
<span class="rightnote">Simen.</span>
toward the sea, taketh the Simen on the west that commeth by Simensburge
into the same, the whole streame soone after falling into the sea, and
leauing a pretie hauenet.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Chare.</span>
The next port is the Chare, serued with two rils in one confluence,
beneath Charemouth. The cheefe head of this riuer is (as Leland saith)
<span class="page"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[Page 101]</span>
in Marshwood parke, and commeth downe by Whitechurch: the other runneth
by west of Wootton, and méeting beneath Charemouth towne (as I said)
dooth fall into the sea. Then came we to the Cobbe, and beheld the Lime
<span class="leftnote">Buddle.</span>
water, which the townesmen call the Buddle, which commeth about thrée
miles by north of Lime, from the hils, fleting vpon Rockie soile, and so
falleth into the sea. Certes, there is no hauen héere that I could sée,
but a quarter of a mile by west southwest of the towne, is a great and
costlie iuttie in the sea for succour of ships. The towne is distant
from Coliton, about fiue miles. And heere we ended our voiage from the
Auon, which conteineth the whole coast of Dorcester, or Dorcetshire, so
that next we must enter into Summerset countie, and sée what waters are
there.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Axe.</span>
The first water that we méet withall in Summersetshire is the Axe, which
riseth in a place called Axe knoll, longing to sir Giles Strangwaie,
néere vnto Cheddington in Dorsetshire, from whence it runneth to
Mosterne, Feborow, Claxton, Weiford bridge, Winsham foord, and receiuing
one rill from the east by Hawkechurch, and soone after another comming
from northwest by Churchstoke, from Wainbroke, it goeth to Axeminster,
<span class="leftnote">Yare aliàs Arte.</span>
beneath which it crosseth the Yare, that commeth from about Buckland, by
Whitstaunton, Yarecombe, Long bridge, Stockeland, Kilmington bridge
(where it receiueth a brooke from by south, that runneth by Dalwood) and
so into the Axe. From hence our Axe goeth to Drake, Musburie, Culliford:
but yer it come altogither at Culliford, it méeteth with a water that
riseth aboue Cotleie, and goeth from thence by Widworthie, Culliton, and
there receiuing a rill also, procéedeth on after the confluence aboue
Culliford bridge, into the Axe, and from thence hold on togither into
the maine sea, whereinto they fall vnder the roots of the winter
cliffes, the points of them being almost a mile in sunder. The most
westerlie of them called Berewood, lieth within halfe a mile of Seton.</p>

<p>But the other toward the east is named Whitecliffe, of which I saie no
more, but that "in the time of Athelstane, the greatest nauie that euer
aduentured into this Iland, arriued at Seton in Deuonshire, being
replenished with aliens that sought the conquest of this Iland, but
Athelstane met and incountered with them in the field, where he
ouerthrew six thousand of his aforesaid enimies. Not one of them also
that remained aliue, escaped from the battell without some deadlie or
verie gréeuous wound. In this conflict moreouer were slaine fiue kings,
which were interred in the churchyard of Axe minster, and of the part of
the king of England were killed eight earles of the chéefe of his
nobilitie, and they also buried in the churchyard aforesaid. Héervnto it
addeth how the bishop of Shireburne was in like sort slaine in this
battell, that began at Brunedune neere to Coliton, and indured euen to
Axe minster, which then was called Brunberie or Brunburg. The same daie
that this thing happened the sunne lost his light, and so continued
without anie brightnesse, vntill the setting of that planet, though
otherwise the season was cléere and nothing cloudie."</p>

<p>As for the hauen which in times past as I haue heard, hath béene at
Sidmouth (so called of Sidde a rillet that runneth thereto) and likewise
at Seton, I passe it ouer, sith now there <span class="leftnote">Sidde. Seton.</span> is
none at all. Yet hath there béene sometime a notable one, albeit, that
at this present betweene the two points of the old hauen, there lieth a
mightie bar of pibble stones, in the verie mouth of it, and the riuer
Axe is driuen to the verie east point of the hauen called White cliffe.
Thereat also a verie little gull goeth into the sea, whither small
fisherbotes doo oft resort for succour. The men of Seton began of late
to stake and make a maine wall within the hauen to haue changed the
course of the Axe, and (almost in the middle of the old hauen) to haue
trenched through the Chesill, thereby to haue let out the Axe, &amp; to haue
taken in the maine sea, but I heare of none effect that this attempt did
come vnto. From Seton westward lieth Coliton, about two miles by west
<span class="leftnote">Colie.</span>
northwest, whereof riseth the riuer Colie, which going by the aforesaid
towne, passeth by Colecombe parke, and afterward falleth betweene Axe
bridge and Axe mouth towne into the Axe riuer.</p>

<p>By west of Bereworth point lieth a créeke, serued (so farre as I
remember) with a fresh water that commeth from the hilles south of
<span class="rightnote">Sid.</span>
Soutleie or Branscombe. Sidmouth hauen is the next, and thither commeth a
fresh water by S. Maries from the said hils, that goeth from S. Maries
<span class="page"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[Page 102]</span>
aforesaid to Sidburie, &amp; betweene Saltcombe &amp; Sidmouth into the maine
<span class="leftnote">Autrie aliàs Ottereie.</span>
sea. By west of Auterton point also lieth another hauen, and thither
commeth a pretie riueret, whose head is in the Hackpendon hilles, and
commeth downe first by Vpauter, then by a parke side to Mohuns Auter,
Munketon, Honniton, Buckewell, and north of Autrie receiueth a rill
<span class="leftnote">Tale.</span>
called Tale, that riseth northwest of Brodemburie in a wood, and from
whence it commeth by Pehemburie, Vinniton, and making a confluence with
the other, they go as one betwéene Cadde and Autrie, to Herford, Luton,
Collaton, Auterton, Budeleie, and so into the sea. On the west side of
this hauen is Budeleie almost directly against Otterton. It is easie to
be seene also, that within lesse space than one hundred yeers, ships did
vse this hauen, but now it is barred vp. Some call it Budeleie hauen of
Budeleie towne, others Salterne port, of a little créeke comming out of
the maine hauen vnto Salterne village, that hath in time past béene a
towne of great estimation.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Exe.</span>
The Ex riseth in Exmore in Summersetshire, néere vnto Ex crosse, and
goeth from thence vnto Exeford, Winsford, and Extun, where it receiueth
a water comming from Cutcombe, by north. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Ater'">After</ins> this confluence it goeth
on toward the south, till it méet with a pretie brooke rising northeast
of Whettell (going by Brunton Regis) increased at the least with thrée
rilles which come all from by north. These being once met, this water
runneth on by west of the beacon that beareth the name of Haddon, &amp; soone
<span class="leftnote">Barleie.</span>
after taketh in the Barleie, that receiueth in like sort the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Possible misprint for 'Dane', or 'Danes brook'. See TN at end.">Done</ins> at
<span class="leftnote"><br />Done aliàs <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Done stroke', possibly a misprint for 'Danes Brook'. See TN at end.">Dones broke.</ins></span>
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Possible Misprint for 'Hawkridge'.">Hawkbridge</ins>, and from hence goeth by Dauerton, and Combe, and then doth
méet with the Exe, almost in the verie confines betwéene Dorset &amp;
Summersetshires. Being past this coniunction, our Exe passeth betwéene
Brushford and Murbath, and then to Exe bridge, where it taketh in (as I
heare) a water by west from east Austie: and after this likewise another
on ech side, whereof one commeth from Dixford, and Baunton, the other
<span class="leftnote">Woodburne.</span>
called Woodburne, somewhat by east of Okeford. From these meetings it
goeth to Caue and through the forrest and woods to Hatherland and
Washfields, vntill it come to Tiuerton, and here it receiueth the Lomund
water that riseth aboue Ashbrittle, &amp; commeth downe by Hockworthie,
vpper Loman, and so to Tiuerton that standeth almost euen in the verie
<span class="leftnote">Lomund or Simming.</span>
confluence. Some call this Lomund the Simming brooke or Sunnings bath.
After this our Exe goeth to Bickleie, Theuerten, (taking in a rill by
<span class="leftnote">Columbe.</span>
west) nether Exe, Bramford, beneath which it ioineth with the Columbe
that riseth of one head northeast of Clarie Haidon, and of another south
of Shildon, and méeting beneath Columbe stocke, goeth by Columbe and
Bradfeld, and there crossing a rill that commeth by Ashford, it runneth
south to Wood, More haies, Columbton, Brandnicke, Beare, Columbe Iohn,
Hoxham, and ioining (as I said) with the Exe at Bramford, passing vnder
but one bridge, yer it meet with another water by west, growing of the
<span class="leftnote">Cride.<br />
Forten.</span>
Forten and Cride waters (except it be so that I doo iudge amisse.) The
Cride riseth aboue Wollesworthie, and néere vnto Vpton: after it is past
Dewrish, crosseth a rill from betweene Puggill and Stockeleie by Stocke
English, &amp;c. From hence it goeth to Fulford, where it méeteth with the
Forten, wherof one branch commeth by Caldbrooke, the other from S. Marie
Tedburne, and ioining aboue Crediton, the chanell goeth on to the Cride,
(which yer long also receiueth another from by north, comming by
Stockeleie and Combe) then betwéene Haine and Newton Sires, to Pines,
and so into the Exe, which staieth not vntill it come to Excester. From
Excester (whither the burgesses in time past laboured to bring the same,
but in vaine) it runneth to Were, there taking in a rill from by west,
and an other lower by Exminster, next of all vnto Toppesham; beneath
<span class="leftnote">Cliuus.</span>
which towne the Cliue entreth thereinto, which rising about Plumtree,
goeth by Cliff Haidon, Cliff Laurence, Brode Cliff, Honiton, Souton,
Bishops Cliff, S. Marie Cliff, Cliff saint George, and then into the
Exe, that runneth forward by Notwell court, Limston and Pouderham
<span class="leftnote">Ken.</span>
castell. Here (as I heare) it taketh in the Ken, or Kenton brooke (as
Leland calleth it) comming from Holcombe parke, by Dunsdike,
Shillingford, Kenford, Ken, Kenton, and so into Exe hauen, at whose
mouth lie certeine rocks which they call the Checkstones, except I be
deceiued. The next fall, whereof Leland saith nothing at all, commeth by
Ashcombe and Dulish, and hath his head in the hilles thereby.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[Page 103]</span></p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Teigne.</span>
The Teigne mouth is the next fall that we came to, &amp; it is a goodlie
port foure miles from Exemouth. The head of this water is twentie miles
from the sea at Teigne head in Dartmore among the Gidleie hilles. From
whence it goeth to Gidleie towne, Teignton drue, where it receiueth the
<span class="leftnote">Crokerne.</span>
Crokerne comming from by north, and likewise an other west of Fulford
parke. Then it goeth to Dufford, Bridford, Kirslowe, Chidleie, Knighton,
<span class="leftnote">Bouie.</span>
and beneath the bridge there receiueth the Bouie, whose course is to
north Bouie, Lilleie, and Bouitracie. Thence it runneth to kings
<span class="leftnote">Eidis.</span>
Teignton, taking in Eidis, a brooke beneath Preston that commeth from
Edeford by the waie. And when it is past this confluence, at kings
<span class="rightnote">Leman.</span>
Teignton, it crosseth the Leman, which commeth from Saddleton rocke by
<span class="leftnote">Aller.</span>
Beckington, and Newton Bushels: and soone after the Aller that riseth
betwéene Danburie and Warog well, afterward falling into the sea by
Bishops Teignton, south of Teignmouth towne.</p>

<p>The verie vtter west point of the land, at the mouth of Teigne is called
the Nesse, and is a verie high red cliffe. The east part of the hauen is
named the Poles, a low sandie ground, either cast vp by the spuing of
the sand out of the Teigne, or else throwne vp from the shore by the
rage of wind and water. This sand occupieth now a great quantitie of the
ground betwéene the hauen where the sand riseth, and Teignmouth towne,
which towne (surnamed Regis) hath in time past béene sore defaced by the
Danes, and of late time by the French.</p>

<p>From Teignemouth we came to Tor baie, wherof the west point is called
Birie, and the east Perritorie, betwéene which is little aboue foure
miles. From Tor baie also to Dartmouth is six miles, where (saith
Leland) I marked diuerse things. First of all vpon the east side of the
hauen a great hillie point called Downesend, and betwixt Downesend, and
a pointlet named Wereford is a little baie. Were it selfe, in like sort,
is not full a mile from Downesend vpward into the hauen. Kingswere towne
standeth out as another pointlet, and betwixt it &amp; Wereford is the
second baie. Somewhat moreouer aboue Kingswere towne goeth a little
créeke vp into the land from the maine streame of the hauen called
Waterhead, and this is a verie fit place for vessels to be made in. In
like sort halfe a mile beyond this into the landward goeth another
longer créeke, and aboue that also a greater than either of these called
Gawnston, whose head is here not halfe a mile from the maine sea, by the
compassing thereof, as it runneth in Tor baie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Dart.</span>
The riuer of Dart or Darent (for I read Derenta muth for Dartmouth)
commeth out of Dartmore fiftéene miles aboue Totnesse, in a verie large
plot, and such another wild morish &amp; forrestie ground as Exmore is. Of
it selfe moreouer this water is verie swift, and thorough occasion of
tin-workes whereby it passeth, it carrieth much sand to Totnesse bridge,
and so choketh the depth of the riuer downeward, that the hauen it selfe
is almost spoiled by the same. The mariners of Dartmouth accompt this to
be about a kenning from Plimmouth. The Darent therefore proceeding from
the place of his vprising, goeth on to Buckland, from whence it goeth to
<span class="leftnote">Ashburne.</span>
Buckland hole; and soone after taking in the Ashburne water on the one
<span class="rightnote"><br />Buckfastlich.</span>
side that runneth from Saddleton rocke by north, and the Buckfastlich
that commeth from north west, it runneth to Staunton, Darington,
Hemston, and there also crossing a rill on ech side passeth foorth to
<span class="leftnote">Hartburne.</span>
Totnesse, Bowden, and aboue Gabriell Stoke, méeteth with the Hartburne
that runneth vnder Rost bridge, two miles aboue Totnes, or (as another
saith) by Ratter, Harberton, Painesford, and Asprempton into Darent,
which yon long also commeth to Corneworthie, Grenewaie, Ditsham,
Darntmouth towne (wherevnto king Iohn gaue sometimes a maior, as he did
vnto Totnesse) from thence betwéene the castelles, and finallie into sea.</p>

<p>From hence we went by Stokeflemming to another water, which commeth from
blacke Auton, then to the second that falleth in east of Slapton, and so
coasting out of this baie by the Start point, we saile almost directlie
west, till we come to Saltcombe hauen. Certes this port hath verie
little fresh water comming to it, and therefore no meruell though it be
barred; yet the head of it (such as it is) riseth néere Buckland, and
goeth to Dudbrooke, which standeth betwéene two créekes. Thence it hieth
<span class="page"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[Page 104]</span>
to Charleton, where it taketh in a rill, whose head commeth from south
and north of Shereford. Finallie it hath another créeke that runneth vp
by Ilton: and the last of all that falleth in north of Portlemouth,
whose head is so néere the baie last afore remembred, that it maketh it
a sorie peninsula (as I haue heard it said.)</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Awne.</span>
Then come we to the Awne, whose head is in the hils farre aboue Brent
towne, from whence it goeth to Dixford wood, Loddewell, Hache, Aunton,
Thorleston, and so into the sea ouer against a rocke called S. Michaels
<span class="leftnote">Arme.</span>
burrow. Arme riseth aboue Harford, thence to Stoford, Iuie bridge,
Armington bridge, Fléet, Orchardton, Ownewell, and so vnto the sea,
which is full of flats and rocks, so that no ship commeth thither in
anie tempest, except it be forced therto, through the vttermost
extremitie and desperat hazard of the fearefull mariners. King Philip of
<span class="leftnote">Sée Hen. 7. pag. 792, 793, 794.</span>
Castile lost two ships here in the daies of king Henrie the seuenth,
when he was driuen to land in the west countrie by the rage of weather.
<span class="rightnote">Yalme.</span>
Yalme goeth by Cornewood, Slade, Stratleie, Yalmeton, Collaton, Newton
ferrie, and so into the sea, about foure miles by south east from the
<span class="leftnote">Plim.</span>
maine streame of Plimmouth. Being past these portlets, then next of all
we come to Plimmouth hauen, a verie busie péece to describe, bicause of
the numbers of waters that resort vnto it, &amp; small helpe that I haue for
the knowledge of their courses; yet will I doo what I may in this, as in
the rest, and so much I hope by Gods grace to performe, as shall suffice
my purpose in this behalfe.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Plim.</span>
The Plimne or Plim, is the verie same water that giueth name to Plimpton
towne. The mouth of this gulfe, wherein the ships doo ride, is walled on
ech side and chained ouer in time of necessitie, and on the south side
of the hauen is a blocke house vpon a rockie hill: but as touching the
riuer it selfe, it riseth in the hils west of Cornewood, and commeth
downe a short course of thrée miles to Newenham after it be issued out
of the ground. From Newenham also it runneth to Plimpton, and soone after
<span class="leftnote">Stoure aliàs Catwater.</span>
into the Stoure, which Stoure ariseth northwest of Shepistour, &amp; goeth
fr&#333; thence to Memchurch, Hele, Shane, Bickleie, and so to Eford,
where taking in the Plim, it runneth downe as one vnder the name of
Plim, vntill it go past Plimmouth, and fall into the hauen south east of
Plimmouth aforesaid. I haue oftentimes trauelled to find out the cause
whie so manie riuers in England are called by this name Stoure, and at
the first supposing that it was growne by the corruption of Dour, the
British word for a streame, I rested thervpon as resolued for a season:
but afterward finding the word to be méere Saxon, and that Stouremare is
a prouince subiect to the duke of Saxonie, I yéelded to another opinion:
whereby I conceiue that the said name was first deriued from the Saxons.
But to returne to our purpose.</p>

<p>Plimmouth it selfe standeth betweene two créeks, not serued with anie
backewater, therefore passing ouer these two, we enter into the Thamar
that dischargeth it selfe into the aforesaid hauen. Going therfore vp
that streame, which for the most part parteth Deuonshire from Cornewall,
<span class="leftnote">Taue or Tauie.</span>
the first riueret that I met withall on the east side is called Tauie,
the head whereof is among the mounteins foure miles aboue Peters Tauie,
beneath which it meeteth with another water from by west, so that these
two waters include Marie Tauie betwéene them, though nothing neere the
confluence. From hence the Taue or Tauie runneth to Tauistocke, aboue
which it taketh in a rill from by west, and another aboue north
Buckland, whose head is in Dartmore, and commeth therevnto by Sandford
and Harrow bridge. From hence it goeth into Thamar, by north Buckland,
moonks Buckland, Beare, and Tamerton follie. Hauing thus dispatched the
<span class="leftnote">Lidde.</span>
Tauie, the next that falleth in on the east side vpwards is the Lidde,
which rising in the hils aboue Lidford, runneth downe by Curriton and
<span class="rightnote">Trushell.</span>
Siddenham, and so to Lidstone, aboue which it receiueth the Trushell
brooke, which rising north east of Brediston, goeth by Trusholton to
Ibaine, where it receiueth a rill that commeth by Bradwood from
Germanswike, and after the confluence runneth to Liston, and from thence
<span class="leftnote">Core.</span>
into the Thamar. The next aboue this is the Corewater, this ariseth
somewhere about Elwell or Helwell, and going by Virginston, runneth on
by saint Giles without anie increase vntill it come to Thamar. Next of
all it taketh in two brookes not much distant in sunder, whereof the one
<span class="page"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[Page 105]</span>
commeth in by Glanton, the other from Holsworthie, and both east of
Tamerton, which standeth on the further banke, &amp; other side of the
Thamar, and west northwest of Tedcote, except the quarter deceiue me.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Thamar.</span>
Certes, the Thamar it selfe riseth in Summersetshire, about thrée miles
northeast of Hartland, and in maner so crosseth ouer the whole west
countrie betwéene sea and sea, that it leaueth Cornewall, a byland or
peninsula. Being therefore descended from the head, by a tract of six
miles, it commeth to Denborow, Pancrase well, Bridge Reuell, Tamerton,
Tetcote, Luffencote, Boiton, and Wirrington, where it meeteth with a
<span class="leftnote">Arteie.</span>
water on the west side called Arteie, that riseth short of Jacobstow.
<span class="rightnote">Kenseie.</span>
Two miles in like sort fr&#333; this confluence, we met with the Kenseie,
whose head is short of Warpeston by south east: from whence it goeth by
Treneglos, Tremone, Tresmure, Trewen, Lanston, and so into the Thamar,
that runneth from hence by Lowwhitton vnto Bradston, and going on toward
Dunterton, taketh in a rill from south Pitherwijc, and by Lesant;
<span class="leftnote">Enian.</span>
beneath Dunterton also it crosseth the Enian. This riuer riseth at
Dauidston, and directeth his race by saint Clethir, Lancast, and
Trelaske first; and then vnder sundrie bridges, vntill it méet with the
Thamar. From hence also the Thamar goeth by Siddenham to Calstocke
bridge, Calstocke towne, Clifton, Cargreue (there abouts taking in a
créeke aboue Landilip) and running on from thence, hasteth toward
<span class="leftnote">Liuer.</span>
Saltash, where it receiueth the Liuer water. The head of Liuer is about
Broomwellie hill, from whence it goeth on to North hill, Lekenhorne,
South hill, and taking in a rill by east (from aboue Kellington) it
runneth on to Newton, Pillaton, Wootton, Blosfleming, saint Erne, and
beneath this village crosseth a rillet that runneth thither from Bicton
by Quithiocke, saint Germans, and Sheuiocke. But to procéed. After the
confluence, it goeth betweene Erlie and Fro Martine castell, and soone
after taking in a rill from by north, that passeth west of saint
Steuens, it is not long yer it fall into the Thamar, which after this
(receiuing the Milbrooke creeke) goeth on by Edgecombe, and betwéene
saint Michaels Ile and Ridden point into the maine sea. And thus haue I
finished the description of Plimmouth water, and all such falles as are
betwéene Newston rocke on the east side, and the Ram head on the other.</p>

<p>After this we procéeded on with our iournie toward the west, and passing
by Longstone, we came soone after to Sothan baie, where we crossed the
Seton water, whose head is about Liscard, &amp; his course by Minheniet,
<span class="leftnote">Sutton.<br />
Low.</span>
Chafrench, Tregowike, Sutton and so into the sea. Then came we to Low,
and going in betwéene it and Mount Ile, we find that it had a branched
course, and thereto the confluence aboue Low. The chiefe head riseth in
the hils, as it were two miles aboue Gaine, and going by that towne, it
ceaseth not to continue his course east of Dulo, till it come a little
aboue Low, where it crosseth and ioineth with the Brodoke water that
runneth from Brodokes by Trewargo, and so into the sea. Next vnto these
<span class="leftnote">Polpir.</span>
are two other rils, of which one is called Polpir, before we come at
Foy, or Fawy.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Fawie.</span>
Foy or Fawy riuer riseth in Fawy moore, on the side of an hill in Fawy
moore, from whence it runneth by certeine bridges, till it méet with the
<span class="leftnote"><br />Glin.</span>
Glin water west of Glin towne, which rising aboue Temple, &amp; méeting with
a rill that commeth in from S. Neotes, doth fall into Fawy a mile and
more aboue Resprin from by east. After this confluence then, it goeth to
Resprin bridge, Lestermen castell, Lostwithiell bridge, Pill, saint
<span class="leftnote">Lerinus.</span>
Kingtons, saint Winnow, and Golant, and here also receiueth the Lerine
water out of a parke, that taketh his waie into the maine streame by
Biconke, Tethe, and the Fining house. Being thus vnited, it proceedeth
vnto Fawy towne, taking in a rill or creeke from aboue it on the one
side, and another beneath it south of Halling on the other: of which two
this latter is the longest of course, sith it runneth thrée good miles
<span class="leftnote">Faw.</span>
before it come at the Foy. Leland writing of this riuer addeth verie
largelie vnto it after this maner. The Fawy riseth in Fawy moore (about
two miles from Camilford by south, and sixtéene miles from Fawy towne)
in a verie quaue mire on the side of an hill. From hence it goeth to
Drainesbridge, to Clobham bridge, Lergen bridge, New bridge, Resprin
<span class="page"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[Page 106]</span>
bridge, and Lostwithiell bridge, where it meeteth with a little brooke,
and néere therevnto parteth it selfe in twaine. Of these two armes
therefore one goeth to a bridge of stone, the other to another of
timber, and soone after ioining againe, the maine riuer goeth to saint
Gwinnowes, from thence also to the point of saint Gwinnowes wood, which
is about halfe a mile from thence, except my memorie dooth faile me.
Here goeth in a salt créeke halfe a mile on the east side of the hauen,
and at the head of it is a bridge called Lerine bridge; the créeke it
selfe in like maner bearing the same denomination.</p>

<p>From Lerine créeke, to S. Caracs pill or créeke, is about halfe a mile,
<span class="leftnote">In the middle of this créeke was a cell of S. Ciret in an
Islet longing sometime to Mountegew a priorie.</span>
and Lower on the east side of the said hauen: it goeth vp also not aboue
a mile and an halfe into the land. From Caracs créeke to Poulmorland a
mile, and this likewise goeth vp scant a quarter of a mile into the
land, yet at the head it parteth it selfe in twaine. From Poulmorland
vnto Bodnecke village halfe a mile, where the passage and repassage is
commonlie to Fawy. From Bodnecke to Pelene point (where a créeke goeth
vp not fullie a thousand paces into the land) a mile, thence to Poulruan
a quarter of a mile, and at this Poulruan is a tower of force, marching
against the tower on Fawy side, betwéene which (as I doo heare) a chaine
hath sometime beene stretched, and likelie inough; for the hauen there
is hardly two bow shot ouer. The verie point of land at the east side of
the mouth of this hauen, is called Pontus crosse, but now Panuche
crosse. It shall not be amisse in this place somewhat to intreat of the
<span class="leftnote">Comwhath.</span>
towne of Fawy, which is called in Cornish Comwhath, and being situat on
the northside of the hauen, is set hanging on a maine rockie hill, being
in length about one quarter of a mile, except my memorie deceiue me.</p>

<p>The renowme of Fawy rose by the wars vnder king Edward the first, Edward
the third, and Henrie the fift, partlie by feats of armes, and partlie
by plaine pirasie. Finallie, the townesmen feeling themselues somwhat at
ease and strong in their purses, they fell to merchandize, and so they
prospered in this their new deuise, that as they trauelled into all
places, so merchants from all countries made resort to them, whereby
within a while they grew to be exceeding rich. The ships of Fawy sailing
on a time by Rhie and Winchelseie in the time of king Edward the third,
refused stoutlie to vale anie bonet there, although warning was giuen
them so to doo by the portgreues or rulers of those townes. Herevpon the
Rhie and Winchelseie men made out vpon them with cut and long taile: but
so hardlie were they interteined by the Fawy pirates (I should saie
aduenturers) that they were driuen home againe with no small losse and
hinderance. Such fauour found the Fawy men also immediatlie vpon this
bickering, that in token of their victorie ouer their winching
aduersaries, and riding ripiers (as they called them in mockerie) they
altered their armes and compounded for new, wherein the scutchion of
Rhie and Winchelseie is quartered with theirs, and beside this the Foyens
<span class="rightnote">Gallants of Foy or Fawy.</span>
were called the gallants of Fawy or Foy, whereof they not a little
reioiced, and more peraduenture than for some greater bootie. And thus
much of Fawy towne, wherein we sée what great successe often commeth of
witlesse and rash aduentures. But to returne againe to our purpose from
whence we haue digressed, and as hauing some desire to finish vp this
our voiage, we will leaue the Fawmouth &amp; go forward on our iournie.</p>

<p>Being therefore past this hauen, we come into Trewardith baie, which
lieth into the land betwéene Canuasse and the Blacke head point, and
here about Leland placeth Vrctoum promontorium. In this we saw the fall
of two small brookes, not one verie far distant from another. The first
of them entring west of Trewardith, the other east of saint Blaies, and
both directlie against Curwarder rocke, except I mistake my compasse.
Neither of them are of anie great course, and the longest not full thrée
miles and an halfe. Wherfore sith they are neither branched nor of anie
great quantitie, what should I make long haruest of a little corne and
spend more time than may well be spared about them?</p>

<p>When we were past the Blacke head, we came to Austell brooke,
<span class="rightnote">Austell.</span>
which is increased with a water that commeth from aboue Mewan, and within a mile
after the confluence, they fall into the sea at Pentoren, from whence we
went by the Blacke rocke, and about the Dudman point, till we came to
<span class="page"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[Page 107]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Chare.</span>
Chare haies, where falleth in a pretie water, whose head is two miles
aboue saint Tues. Thence we went by here and there a méere salt créeke,
till we passed the Graie rocke, in Gwindraith baie, and S. Anthonies
point, where Leland maketh his accompt to enter into Falamouth hauen.</p>

<p>The Fala riseth a little by north of Penuenton towne,
<span class="leftnote">Fala.</span>
and going westward
till it come downwards toward saint Dionise, it goeth forth from thence
to Melader, saint Steuens Grampont, Goldon, Crede, Corneleie, Tregue,
Moran, Tregunnan, it falleth into the hauen with a good indifferent
force: and this is the course of Fala. But least I should séeme to omit
those creekes that are betwéene this and S. Anthonies point, I will go a
little backe againe, and fetch in so manie of them, as come now to my
remembrance. Entring therefore into the port, we haue a créeke that
runneth vp by saint Anthonies toward saint Gereus, then another that
goeth into the land by east of saint Maries castell, with a forked head,
passing in the meane time by a great rocke that lieth in the verie midst
of the hauen, in maner of the third point of a triangle, betwéene saint
Maries castell and Pendinant.</p>

<p>Thence we cast about by the said castell, and came by another créeke
that falleth in by east, then the second aboue saint Iustus, the third
at Ardenora, the fourth at Rilan. And hauing as it were visited all
these in order, we came backe againe about by Tregonnian, and then going
vpward betweene it and Taluerne, till we came to Fentangolan, we found
the confluence of two great creekes beneath saint Clements, whereof one
hath a fresh water comming downe by S. Merther, the other another from
Truro, increased with sundrie branches, though not one of them of anie
greatnesse, and therefore vnworthie to be handled. Pole hole standeth
vpon the head almost of the most easterlie of them. S. Kenwen and Truro
stand aboue the confluence of other two. The fourth falleth in by west
from certeine hils: as for the fift and sixt, as they be little créeks
and no fresh, so haue I lesse language and talke to spend about them.</p>

<p>Of saint Caie, and saint Feokes créeke, whose issue is betwéene
<span class="leftnote">S. Caie.<br />
S. Feoks.</span>
Restronget and créeke of Trurie, I sée no cause to make any long spéech;
yet I remember that the towne of S. Feoke standeth betwéene them both.
That also called after this saint, rising aboue Perannarwothill, and
comming thence by Kirklo, falleth into Falamouth, northeast of Milor,
which standeth vpon the point betwéene it and Milor créeke. Milor creeke
<span class="rightnote">Milor.</span>
is next Restronget: some call it Milor poole, from whence we went by
Trefusis point, and there found an other great fall from Perin, which
being branched in the top, hath Perin towne almost in the verie
confluence. And thus much by my collection of the fall. But for somuch
as Leland hath taken some paines in the description of this riuer, I
will not suffer it to perish, sith there is other matter conteined
therein worthie remembrance, although not deliuered in such order as the
thing it selfe requireth.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Fala.</span>
The verie point (saith he) of the hauen mouth (being an hill whereon the
king hath builded a castell) is called Pendinant. It is about a mile in
compasse, almost inuironed with the sea: and where the sea couereth not,
the ground is so low that it were a small mastrie to make Pendinant an
Iland. Furthermore, there lieth a cape or foreland within the hauen a
mile and a halfe, and betwixt this and maister Killigrewes house one
great arme of the hauen runneth vp to Penrine towne, which is three
miles from the verie entrie
<span class="leftnote">Leuine.</span>
of Falamouth hauen, and two good miles from Penfusis. Moreouer there is
Leuine, Priselo, betwixt saint Budocus and Pendinas, which were a good
hauen but for the barre of sand. But to procéed.</p>

<p>The first creeke or arme that casteth on the northwest side of Falemouth
hauen, goeth vp to Perin, and at the end it breaketh into two armes,
whereof the lesse runneth to Glasenith, Viridis nidus, the gréene nest,
or Wagméere at Penrine: the other to saint Glunias the parish church of
Penrine. In like sort out of each side of Penrine créeke, breaketh an
arme yer it come to Penrine. This I vnderstand also that stakes and
foundations of stone haue béene set in the créeke at Penrine a little
lower than the wharfe, where it breaketh into armes: but howsoeuer this
<span class="page"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[Page 108]</span>
standeth, betwixt the point of Trefusis and the point of Restronget is
<span class="leftnote">Milor.</span>
Milor créeke, which goeth vp a mile into the land, and by the church is
a good rode for ships. The next creeke beyond the point of Restronget
wood, <span class="leftnote">Restronget.</span> is called Restronget, which going two
miles vp into the maine, breaketh into two armes. In like order betwixt
Restronget and the creeke of Trurie be two créekes; one called saint
<span class="leftnote">S. Feoks.<br />
S. Caie.</span>
Feokes, the other saint Caie, next vnto which is Trurie créeke that
goeth vp about two miles créeking from the principall streame, and
breaketh within halfe a mile of Trurie, casting in a branch westward
euen hard by Newham wood.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Trurie créeke.</span>
This creeke of Trurie is diuided into two parts before the towne of
Trurie, and each of them hauing a brooke comming downe and a bridge, the
towne of Trurie standeth betwixt them both. In like sort Kenwen stréet
is seuered from the said towne with this arme, and Clements street by
east with the other. Out of the bodie also of Trurie creeke breaketh
another eastward a mile from Trurie, and goeth vp a mile and a halfe to
Cresilian bridge of stone. At the verie entrie and mouth of this créeke
is a rode of ships called Maples rode: and here fought not long since
eightéene ships of Spanish merchants, with foure ships of warre of
Deepe, but the Spaniards draue the Frenchmen all into this harborow. A
mile and an halfe aboue the mouth of Crurie creeke, is another named
<span class="leftnote">Moran.</span>
Lhan Moran of S. Morans church at hand. This créeke goeth vp a quarter
of a mile from the maine streame into the hauen, as the maine streame
goeth vp two miles aboue Moran créeke ebbing and flowing: and a quarter
of a mile higher, is the towne of Cregowie, where we found a bridge of
stone vpon the Fala riuer. Fala it selfe riseth a mile or more west of
Roche hill, and goeth by Graund pont, where I saw a bridge of stone.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Graund pont.</span>
This Graund pont is foure miles from Roche hill, and two little miles
from Cregowie, betwixt which the Fala taketh his course. From Cregowie
to passe downe by the bodie of the hauen of Falamouth to the mouth of
Lanie horne pill or créeke, on the south side of the hauen is a mile,
and (as I remember) it goeth vp halfe a mile from the principall streame
of the hauen. From Lanihorne pill also is a place or point of sand about
a mile waie of fortie acres or thereabout (as a peninsula) called
Ardeuerauter. As for the water or créeke that runneth into the south
southeast part, it is but a little thing of halfe a mile vp into the
land, and the créeke that hemmeth in this peninsula, of both dooth seeme
to be the greater. From the mouth of the west creeke of this peninsula,
vnto saint Iustes creeke, is foure miles or more.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">S. Iustus.<br />
S. Mawes.</span>
In like maner from saint Iustes pill or créeke (for both signifie one
thing) to saint Mawes creeke is a mile and a halfe, and the point
betwéene them both is called Pendinas. The créeke of saint Mawes goeth
vp a two miles by east northeast into the land, and beside that it
ebbeth and floweth so farre, there is a mill driuen with a fresh créeke
that resorteth to the same. Halfe a mile from the head of this downeward
to the hauen, is a créeke in maner of a poole, whereon is a mill also
that grindeth with the tide. And a mile beneath that on the south side
entereth a créeke (about halfe a mile into the countrie) which is barred
from the maine sea by a small sandie banke, and another mile yet lower,
is an other little créekelet. But how so euer these créekes doo run,
certeine it is that the bankes of them that belong to Fala are
meruellouslie well woodded. And hitherto Leland, whose words I dare not
alter, for feare of corruption and alteration of his iudgement. Being
past Falmouth hauen therefore (as it were a quarter of a mile beyond
Arwennach, maister Killegrewes place which standeth on the brimme or
shore within Falmouth) we came to a little hauen which ran vp betwéene
two hilles, but it was barred: wherefore we could not learne whether it
were serued with anie backe fresh water or not.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Polwitherall.</span>
From thence we went by Polwitherall creeke (parted into two armes) then
<span class="leftnote"><br />Polpenrith.</span>
to the Polpenrith, wherevnto a riueret falleth that riseth not farre
from thence, and so goeth to the maine streame of the hauen at the last,
whither the créeke resorteth about thrée miles and more from the mouth
of the hauen, and into which the water that goeth vnder Gare bridges,
<span class="page"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[Page 109]</span>
doo fall in one bottome (as Leland hath reported.) Vnto this hauen
<span class="rightnote">Wike.<br />
Gare.
Mogun.<br />
Penkestell.<br />
Callous.<br />
Cheilow.<br />
Gilling.</span>
also repaireth the Penkestell, the Callous, the Cheilow, and the
Gilling, although this latter lieth against saint Mawuons on the hither
side hard without the hauen mouth (if I haue doone aright.) For so
motheaten, mouldie, &amp; rotten are those bookes of Leland which I haue,
and beside that, his annotations are such and so confounded, as no man
can (in a maner) picke out anie sense from them by a leafe togither.
Wherefore I suppose that he dispersed and made his notes intricate of
set purpose: or else he was loth that anie man should easilie come to
that knowledge by reading, which he with his great charge &amp; no lesse
trauell attained vnto by experience. Thus leauing Fala hauen, as more
troublesome for me to describe, than profitable for seafaring men,
without good aduise to enter into, we left the rocke on our left hand,
and came straight southwest to Helford hauen, whose water commeth downe
<span class="leftnote">Haile.</span>
from Wréeke (where is a confluence of two small rilles whereof that rill
consisteth) by Mawgan and Trelawarren, and then it receiueth a rill on
the north ripe from Constantine, after whose confluence it goeth a maine
vntill it come to the Ocean, where the mouth is spoiled by sand comming
from the tinworks. See Leland in the life of S. Breaca. Beneath this
also is another rill comming from S. Martyrs, by whose course, and
another ouer against it on the west side that falleth into the sea by
Winniton, all Menage is left almost in maner of an Iland. From hence we
go south to the Manacle point, then southwest to Lisard, and so north
and by west to Predannocke points, beyond which we méet with the fall of
the said water that riseth in the edge of Menag, and goeth into the sea
by Melien on the north, and Winniton on the south. By north also of
<span class="leftnote">Curie.</span>
Winniton is the Curie water that runneth short of Magan, and toucheth
with the Ocean south of Pengwenian point.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Loo.</span>
From hence we sailed to the Loo mouth, which some call Lopoole, because
it is narrower at the fall into the sea, than it is betwéene the sea and
Hailston. It riseth aboue S. Sethians, and comming downe by Wendron, it
hasteth to Hailston or Helston, from whence onelie it is called Loo: but
betwéene Helston and the head, men call it commonlie Cohor. Of this
riuer Leland saith thus: The Lopoole is two miles in length, and betwixt
it and the maine Ocean is but a barre of sand that once in thrée or
foure yéeres, what by weight of the fresh water, and working of the sea
breaketh out, at which time it maketh a wonderfull noise: but soone
after the mouth of it is barred vp againe. At all other times the
superfluitie of the water of Lopole (which is full of trout and éele)
draineth out through the sandie barre into the open sea: certes if this
barre could alwaies be kept open, it would make a goodlie hauen vp vnto
Haileston towne, where coinage of tin is also vsed, as at Trurie and
Lostwithiell, for the quéenes aduantage.</p>

<p>Being passed the Loo, I came to another water that descendeth without
<span class="leftnote">Simneie.</span>
anie increase from Crowan by Simneie, whose whole course is not aboue
thrée miles in all. Then going by the Cuddan point, we entered the
mounts Baie, and going streight north (leauing S. Michaels mount a
<span class="leftnote">Lid.</span>
little vpon the left hand) we came to the Lid, which rising short of
Tewidnacke, descendeth by Lidgenan, and so into the sea. Certes the
course of these waters cannot be long, sith in this verie place this
breadth of land is not aboue foure miles, and not more than fiue at the
verie lands end. There is also a rill east of Korugie, and Guluall, and
another west of the same hard at hand, and likewise the third east of
Pensants: and not a full quarter of a mile from the second, southwest of
Pensants also lieth the fourth that commeth from Sancrete ward by
Newlin, from whence going southwest out of the baie by Moushole Ile,
that lieth south of Moushole towne, we come to a water that entreth into
the Ocean betwixt Remels &amp; Lamorleie point. Trulie the one head thereof
commeth from by west of Sancrete, the other from by west of an hill that
standeth betwéene them both, and ioining aboue Remels, it is not long
yer they salute their grandame. After this, and before we come at
Rosecastell, there are two other créekes, whereof one is called
Boskennie, that riseth south of saint Buriens, and an other somewhat
longer than the first, that issueth by west of the aforesaid towne,
wherein is to be noted, that our cards made heretofore doo appoint
<span class="page"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[Page 110]</span>
S. Buriens to be at the very lands end of Cornewall, but experience now
teacheth vs, that it commeth not néere the lands end by thrée miles.
This latter rill also is the last that I doo reade of on the south side,
and likewise on the west and north, till we haue sailed to S. Ies baie,
<span class="leftnote">Bresan Ile.</span>
which is full ten miles from the lands end, or Bresan Ile eastward, &amp;
rather more, if you reckon to the fall of the Haile, which lieth in the
very middest and highest part of the baie of the same. The soile also is
verie hillie here, as for saint Ies towne, it is almost (as I said) a
byland, and yet is it well watered with sundrie rilles that come from
those hilles vnto the same.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Haile.</span>
The Haile riseth in such maner, and from so manie heads, as I haue
before said: howbeit I will adde somewhat more vnto it, for the benefit
of my readers. Certes the chéefe head of Haile riseth by west of
Goodalfin hilles, and going downe toward saint Erthes, it receiueth the
second, and best of the other three rilles from Goodalfin towne:
finallie, comming to saint Erthes, and so vnto the maine baie, it taketh
<span class="leftnote">Clowart.</span>
in the Clowart water from Guimer, south of Phelacke, which hath two
heads, the said village standing directlie betwixt them both.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Caine.</span>
The Caine riseth southeast of Caineburne towne a mile and more, from
whence it goeth without increase by west of Gwethian, and so into the
sea west of Mara Darwaie. From hence we coasted about the point, &amp; left
the baie till we came to a water that riseth of two heads from those
hilles that lie by south of the same: one of them also runneth by saint
Vni, another by Redreuth, and méeting within a mile, they fall into the
<span class="leftnote">Luggam.</span>
Ocean beneath Luggam or Tuggan. A mile and a halfe from this fall we
come vnto another small rill, and likewise two other créekes, betwixt
which the towne of saint Agnes standeth; and likewise the fourth halfe a
mile beyond the most easterlie of these, whose head is almost thrée
miles within the land in a towne called saint Alin. Thence going by the
Manrocke, and west of saint Piran in the sand, we find a course of thrée
miles and more from the head, and hauing a forked branch, the parts doo
méet at west aboue saint Kibbard, and so go into the sea. I take this to
<span class="leftnote">S. Pirans créeke. Carantocke.</span>
be saint Pirans créeke, for the next is Carantocke pill or créeke, whose
head is at Guswarth, from whence it goeth vnto Trerise, and soone after
taking in a rill from by west, it runneth into the sea coast of saint
Carantakes. Beyond this is another créeke that riseth aboue little saint
Colan, and goeth by lesse saint Columbe: and east and by north hereof
commeth downe one more whose head is almost south of the Nine stones, &amp;
going from thence to great saint Columbes, it passeth by Lamberne, and
so into the sea. S. Merous créeke is but a little one, rising west of
Padstow, and falling in almost ouer against the Gull rocke. Then turning
<span class="leftnote">Padstow.<br />
Locus bufonis.</span>
betwéene the point and the blacke rocke,we entred into Padstow hauen
thrée miles lower than port Issec, and a mile from port Ewin, whose
waters remaine next of all to be described.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Alannus.</span>
The Alan ariseth flat east from the hauen mouth of Padstow, well néere
<span class="leftnote"><br />Eniam.</span>
eight or nine miles about Dauidstone, neere vnto which the Eniam also
issueth, that runneth into the Thamar. Going therefore from hence it
passeth to Camelford, saint Aduen, saint Bernard (both Cornish saints)
and soone after receiueth a rill at northeast, descending from Rowters
hill. Thence it goeth to Bliseland, and Helham, the first bridge of name
that standeth vpon Alin. Yer long also it taketh in one rill by south
from Bodman, another from saint Laurence, the third by west of this, and
the fourth that commeth by Wethiell, no one of them excéeding the course
of thrée miles, and all by south. From hence it goeth toward
Iglesaleward, and there receiueth a water on the east side, which
commeth about two miles from saint Teath, by Michelston, saint Tuchoe,
saint Maben (mo Cornish patrons) and finallie south of Iglesall, méeteth
with the Alen that goeth from thence by S. Breaca to Woodbridge.
Hereabout I find, that into our Alein or Alen, there should fall two
<span class="leftnote">Carneseie.<br />
Laine.</span>
riuerets, whereof the one is called Carneseie, the other Laine, and
comming in the end to full notice of the matter, I sée them to issue on
seuerall sides beneath Woodbridge almost directlie the one against the
other. That which descendeth from northwest, and riseth about saint Kew,
is named Carneseie, as I heare: the other that commeth in on the
<span class="page"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[Page 111]</span>
southwest banke hight Laine, and noted by Leland to rise two miles aboue
S. Esse. But howsoeuer this matter standeth, there are two other créekes
<span class="leftnote">Pethrike.<br />
Minner.<br />
Dunmere.</span>
on ech side also, beneath these, as Pethrike creeke, and Minner créeke
(so called of the Cornish saints) for that soile bred manie, wherewith I
finish the description of Alen, or (as some call it) Dunmere, and other
Padstow water.</p>

<p>From Padstow hauen also they saile out full west to Waterford in
Ireland. There are likewise two rockes, which lie in the east side of
the hauen, secretlie hidden at full sea, as two pads in the straw,
whereof I think it taketh the name. Yet I remember how I haue read that
Padstow is a corrupted word for Adlestow, and should signifie so much as
Athelstani locus, as it may well be. For it is euident that they had in
time past sundrie charters of priuilege from Athelstane, although at
this present it be well stored with Irishmen. But to our purpose. Leland
supposed this riuer to be the same Camblan, where Arthur fought his last
and fatall conflict: for to this daie men that doo eare the ground
there, doo oft plow vp bones of a large size, and great store of armour,
or else it may be (as I rather coniecture) that the Romans had some
field (or Castra) thereabout, for not long since (and in the remembrance
of man) a brasse pot full of Romane coine was found there, as I haue
often heard. Being thus passed Padstow hauen, and after we had gone
three miles from hence, we came to Portgwin a poore fisher towne, where
I find a brooke and a péere. Then I came to Portissec aliàs Cunilus two
miles further, and found there a brooke, a péere, and some succor for
fisher boats. Next of all vnto a brooke that ran from south east,
directlie north into the Sauerne sea, and within halfe a mile of the
same laie a great blacke rocke like an Iland. From this water to
Treuenni is about a mile, where the paroch church is dedicated to saint
Simphorian, and in which paroch also Tintagell or Dundagie castell
standeth, which is a thing inexpugnable for the situation, and would be
made with little reparations one of the strongest things in England. For
it standeth on a great high terrible crag inuironed with the sea. There
is a chappell yet standing in the dungeon thereof, dedicated to saint
Vlet. Tintagell towne and Treuenni are not a mile in sunder.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Tredwie.</span>
The next créeke is called Bosinni, which is a mile from Tintagell, and
to the same Tredwie water resorteth, and so they go to the sea betwixt
two hils, whereof that on the one side lieth out like an arme or cape,
and maketh the fashion of an hauenet or peere, whither shiplets sometime
doo resort for succour. A frier of late daies tooke vpon him to make an
hauen at this place, but in vaine. There lie also two blacke rocks as
Ilets, at the west northwest point, or side of this créeke, the one
(sauing that a little gut dooth part them) ioining with the other, and
in these by all likelihood is great store of gulles. I can not tell
whether this be the water that runneth by Boscastell or not, but if it
<span class="leftnote">Boscastell.</span>
be not, then haue I this description of the latter. Boscastell créeke
that lieth east of Tintagell, is but a small thing, running at the most
not aboue two miles into the land, yet it passeth by foure townes,
whereof the first is called Lesneth, the second saint Juliet, the third
Minster, and the fourth Boscastell or Bushcastell, as some men doo
pronounce it.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bede.</span>
In Bede baie I find the Bedewater, whose chiefe head is not farre from
<span class="leftnote"><br />Lancels.</span>
Norton. Thence running to Stratton, it receiueth the Lancels rill before
it come at Norham. And here also it crosseth another whose head is east
of saint Marie wijke, from whence it runneth by Wolston and Whalesborow,
and thence into the sea betweene Efford and Plough hill. And thus much
of the waters that lie betwéene the point of Cornewall, and the Hartland
head vpon the north side of Cornewall. Now let vs doo the like with
those that remaine of Deuonshire, whereo the said Hartland is the verie
first point in this our poeticall voiage. Hauing therefore brought
Hartland point on our backs, we come next of all to Barstable bar, and
so into the hauen, whereinto two principall streams doo perpetuallie
vnburden their chanels.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Ocus.</span>
The first and more westerlie of these is called Ocus, whose head is not
farre west of the head of Darnt, and Loth in Darntmore. Rising therefore
in the aforesaid place, it runneth northwest to Snorton, and so to
Okehampton, beneath which towne it méeteth with an other water comming
from southeast, &amp; riseth not much west from the head of Tawe. From hence
<span class="page"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[Page 112]</span>
it goeth to Stow Exborne, Moonke Okington, &amp; Iddesleie, where it taketh
<span class="rightnote">Tanridge.<br />
Turrege.</span>
in the Tanridge a verie pretie streamelet, whose issue is not full a mile
by east from the head of Thamar, thrée miles by north east from
Hartland. Comming therefore by west and east Putford, Bulworthie,
Bockington, Newton, and Shebbor, it receiueth a forked rill that runneth
from ech side of Bradworthie by Sutcombe, Treborow, Milton, &amp; so to
Thornebirie, where méeting with an other forked water (whereof one head
comming from Dunsland, ioineth with the other north of Cockbirie) it
goeth with speed into the Tanridge water. After this confluence it
<span class="leftnote">Buckland.</span>
runneth on to Shéepewash (by west whereof falleth in the Buckland water
from by north) thence to high Hainton, and so to Haitherlaie, north
wherof it taketh in a rill from by south, and endeth his race at
Iddesleie, by ioining with the Oke. Hence then the Ocus hasteth to
Dowland, and betwéene it and Doulton, receiueth one rill from by east,
as it dooth an other betwéene Doulton and Marton from by west, and so
procéeding on with his course, it commeth east of Torrington the lesse,
and taking in a water at east, that runneth from thrée heads (by Wollie
parke) betweene which Combe and Roughborow are situat, it descendeth to
<span class="leftnote">Langtrée.</span>
Torington the more, and meeting with the Langtrée water on the one side,
<span class="rightnote">Were or Ware.</span>
and the Ware brooke on the other, it procéedeth to Bediford, crossing a
rill by the waie that commeth vnto it betwéene Annarie &amp; Littham. From
Bediford bridge it goeth without anie increase to Westleie, Norham,
Appledoure, and so into the hauen.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Taw.</span>
The Taw of both is the more noble water, notwithstanding that his hauen
be barred with sand; and thereby dangerous, and hath most rils
descending into his chanell. Howbeit, by these two is all the hart of
Deuonshire well watered on the northside of the moores. The Tawy riseth
directlie at south west of Throwlie, and north of the head of Darnt, or
(as Leland saith) in Exmore south east from Barstable. From thence also
it runneth to Sele, South Taueton, Cockatre, Bath, Northtaueton,
Ashridge, Colridge, and soone after receiueth the Bowmill créeke, wherof
<span class="leftnote">Bowmill.</span>
one head riseth at Bow, the other at Mill, and meeting beneth Bishops
Morchard, they fall into the Taw north of Nimeth Rowland, as I haue
béene informed. From hence then it runneth by Edgeforth, to Chimligh, by
south whereof it méeteth with a rill comming downe of two heads from
about Rakenford, by Wetheridge and Chawleie. Thence it goeth to
<span class="leftnote">Moulebraie.</span>
Burrington, and Chiltenholtwood, and there taketh in the Moulebraie
water consisting of two in one chanell, wherof the Moll dooth rise aboue
north Moulton, and comming to Moulton receiueth another rill running
from Molland, and soone after the second that growing by two brookes
(the head of one being at Knawston, and of the other west of Crokeham,
and both vniting themselues beneath Mariston) dooth fall into the same
yer long also, and so go togither till it crosse the Braie, which (being
<span class="leftnote">Braie.</span>
the second of the two that maketh the Moulbraie) riseth at Braie,
commeth by Buckland, and south of Holtwood dooth make his confluence
with Taw. Being past the wood, it goeth on to Brightleie hall, Taueton,
Tauestocke, &amp; Berstable, sometime a pretie walled towne with foure
gates, but now a little thing; and such in déed, as that the suburbes
thereof are greater than it selfe. I suppose that the name of this towne
in the British speach was Abertaw, bicause it stood toward the mouth of
Taw, and Berdnesse pronounced short (as I gesse) for Abernesse. As for
Staple, it is an addition for a market, &amp; therefore hath nothing to doo
in the proper name of the towne. King Athelstane is taken here for the
chiefe priuileger of the towne. This is also worthie to be noted hereof,
that the houses there are of stone, as most are in all the good townes
thereabout.</p>

<p>But to proceed with our purpose. Beneath this towne there falleth in a
water that hath one head néere about Challacombe, &amp; another at east
Downe, whereof this descending by Stoke riuer, and the other by
Sherwell, they vnite themselues within thrée miles of Berstaple. Soone
after also it taketh in another that descendeth from Bitenden by
Ashford, and the last of all east of saint Anthonies chappell, named the
<span class="leftnote">Doneham.</span>
Doneham, bicause one head is at west Done, and the other at Ham, both of
them méeting west of Ash. And thus is Taue described, which is no great
water nor quicke streame, as may appéere in Low water marke at Berstable
and yet is it a pretie riueret. This also is worthie to be noted
<span class="page"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[Page 113]</span>
thereof, that it receiueth no brooke from by west, whereof I would
somewhat maruell, if Taurige were not at hand.</p>

<p>Being past the Taue, Cride baie and Bugpoint aliàs Bagpoint, we go by
More baie, Morstone aliàs Mortstone, and then toward the northeast, till
we come by a créekelet to Ilfare combe, &amp; so to Combe Marton, whereat (I
meane ech of them) are sundrie créekes of salt water, but not serued
with anie fresh that I as yet doo heare of. Marrie there is betwéene
Martinbow &amp; Trensow, a créeke that hath a backewater, which descendeth
<span class="leftnote">Paradine.</span>
from Parracombe (so farre as I call to mind named Parradine becke) but
<span class="leftnote"><br />Orus.</span>
the greatest of all is betweene Linton and Connisberie called Ore, which
riseth in Summersetshire in Exmore (east of Hore oke, more than a mile)
and going by Owre, falleth into the sea betwéene Linton and Conisberie,
so that the whole race thereof amounteth in and out to an eight miles,
as I haue heard reported. Thus haue I finished the discourse of the
<span class="leftnote">The bredth of Deuonshire &amp; Cornewall.</span>
waters of Deuonshire, whose breadth in this place from hence ouerthwart
to the Checkstones in the mouth of Ex, on the south side of the Ile, is
eight and thirtie miles or vnder fortie, and so much likewise is it from
Plimmouth to Hartland point, but the broadest part there commeth to six
and thirtie miles, whereas the broadest part of Cornewall doth want two
miles of fortie.</p>

<p>Being past the aforesaid limits of the counties we came to Portlochbaie,
<span class="leftnote">Loch.</span>
whither commeth a water named Loch that descendeth from Stokepero,
<span class="rightnote"><br />Durus.</span>
Lucham and Portloch without increase. Thence to Dunsteir brooke, which
runneth from about Wootton, and Courtneie by Tunbercombe and Dunsteir,
then to another that commeth west of Old Cliffe, leauing a parke on the
<span class="leftnote">Vacetus.</span>
west side, next of all to Watchet water, whereof one head commeth from
the Quantocke hils south of Bickualer by Westquantocke head, and almost
<span class="leftnote">Williton.</span>
at Doniford, receiueth the Williton becke, then to east Quantocke brooke
<span class="leftnote"><br />Doddington.</span>
(omitting a créeket) &amp; next of all to Doddington water, that goeth by
Holford, Alfoxton, and afterward into the sea. From hence we go by
Bottesall point, to Stert point, where two noble riuers doo make their
confluence, which I will seuerallie describe, as to my purpose
apperteineth.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Iuelus.</span>
The first of these is called the Iuell, or (as I find it in an ancient
writer) Yoo, who saith that the riuer Yoo dooth runne from Ilchester to
Bridgewater, and so into the sea. It riseth aboue Oburne, and at
Shirburne receiueth a water, whereof Leland saith thus. There are seuen
<span class="leftnote">The seuen sisters.</span>
springs in an hill called the seuen sisters, north east from Shireburne,
which gather into one bottome, &amp; come into the Mere. Another brooke
likewise commeth by Heidon from Puscandell, three miles from thence by
flat east, betwixt the parke and the Mere full so great as the streame
of the Mere, and ioining at the lower mill of Shireburne, with the Mere
water, it is not long yer it fall into the Euill. Thence our Euill goeth
on towards Glasen Bradford, and yer it come there taketh in a forked
rill from by south, descending from about west Chelburie and Chetnall in
Dorsetshire, beneath which towne the other head falleth into the same,
so that they run foorth by Bearhaggard and Thorneford (till they méet
with the Iuell) and so to Clifton, Euill a proper market towne, Trent,
<span class="leftnote">Cade.</span>
Mutford, Ashinton, and east of Limminton it méeteth with the Cade that
runneth from Yarlington, by north Cadbirie, and soone after crossing a
rill also from by east, that commeth from Blackeford by Compton, it
hasteth to south Cadbirie, Sparkeford, Queenes Camell, west Camell, and
so into Iuell, which runneth on to Kimmington, Ilchester, Ilbridge, long
Sutton, and yer it come at Langport, taketh in two famous waters in one
chanell, next of all to be remembred before I go anie further. The first
of all these riseth southeast betwéene the Parrets (where it is called
<span class="leftnote">Parret.</span>
Parret water) and goeth to Crokehorne, and at Meriot taketh in a brooke
from the east, which consisteth of two courses vnited at Bowbridge,
whereof the one descendeth from Pen by Hasilburie, the other from aboue
the thrée Chenocks, as I doo vnderstand.</p>

<p>From hence also they go as one with the Parret water, toward south
Pederton (taking in at east a becke comming from Hamden hill) thence to
Pederton, Lambrooke, Thorneie bridge, and Muchelneie where it méeteth
<span class="leftnote">Ill.</span>
with the second called Ill or Ilus, whose head is aboue Chellington, &amp;
comming downe from thence by Cadworth, before it come at Dunniet, it
taketh in a rill that runneth by Chascombe and Knoll. Thence leauing
<span class="page"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[Page 114]</span>
Ilmister on the east side, it meeteth with another from by east,
descending from about Whitlakington. Then it goeth to Pokington (where it
<span class="leftnote">Ilton.</span>
crosseth the Ilton water by west) next to Ilbruers, and there it ioineth
with a rillet that riseth by west at Staple, and runneth by Bicknell and
Abbats Ilie, and after this confluence goeth on toward Langport. And
here after some mens opinion, the Iuell looseth his name, and is called
Parret: but this coniecture cannot hold, sith in the old writers it is
called Iuell, till it fall into the sea. Neuerthelesse, how soeuer this
matter standeth, being past Langport, it goeth by Awber toward saint
Anthonies, where it méeteth with the Tone next of all to be described.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Tone.</span>
The Tone issueth at Clatworthie, and goeth by west of Wiuelscombe, to
Stawleie, Ritford, Runton, Wellington and Bradford, beneath which it
taketh in a faire water c&#333;ming from Sanford Combe, Elworthie, Brunt
Rafe, Miluerton, Oke and Hilfarens. After this confluence also it
runneth to Helebridge, and there below méeteth with one water that
runneth by Hawse, Hethford, and Norton, then another from Crokeham by
bishops Slediard, and the third &amp; fourth at Taunton, that descendeth
from Kingston by north, and another by south that riseth about
Pidmister. And thus is the Tone increased, which goeth from Taunton to
Riston, Crech, Northcurrie, Ling, and so by Anthonie into the Iuell,
<span class="leftnote">Chare or Care.</span>
that after this confluence méeteth yer long with the Chare, a pretie
riuer that commeth by east from Northborow, by Carleton, Badcare,
Litecare, Somerton, Higham, Audrie moore, Audrie, and Michelsborow. From
whence going on betweene Quéenes moore and North moore, it receiueth one
<span class="leftnote">Peder.</span>
brooke called Peder from by southwest, that runneth through Pederton
parke and North moore; and likewise another that passeth by Durleie, yer
it doo come at Bridgewater. From Bridgewater it goeth by Chilton
directlie northwest, and then turning flat west, it goeth northward
towards the sea, taking in two waters by the waie, whereof one runneth
<span class="leftnote">Camington.</span>
by Coripole &amp; Camington, and beareth the name of Camington, the other by
<span class="rightnote">Brier.</span>
Siddington and Comage, and then receiuing the Brier before it come at
Start point, they fall as one into the Ocean, whereof let this suffice
for the description of the Iuell, whose streame dooth water all the west
part of Summersetshire and leaueth it verie fruitfull.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Brier.</span>
The Brier, Bruer, or Bréer, riseth of two waters, wherof one is in
Selwood forest, &amp; commeth downe by Bruecombe, Bruham, and Bruton. The
<span class="rightnote"><em>Leland</em> writeth the first Brieuelus and the second
Mellodunus or the Milton water.</span>
other which Leland nameth Mellos, is northest of Staffordell towne, and
going by the same, it runneth by Redlinch, to Wike; where it méeteth
with the other head, and thence go on as one to Awnsford, Alford (where
<span class="leftnote">Dulis.</span>
it taketh in a water called Dulis from by north that riseth néere
Dolting, and commeth by Euerchurch parke) then to the Lidfords, Basborow
wood, the Torhill, Pont perilous (whereinto they fable that Arthur being
wounded to death did throw Calibur his sword) by Glastenburie and so into
the Méere. Beside this riuer there are two other also that fall into the
<span class="leftnote">Sowaie or Stowaie.</span>
said Méere, whereof the one called Sowaie commeth from Créechurch parke,
<span class="leftnote">Cos.</span>
and Pulton by Hartlacke bridge, the other named Cos or the Coscombe
water, from aboue Shepton, Mallet (which east of Wike taketh in a water
comming from Welles) by Wike, Gedneie, and so into the Méere. Finallie,
returning all into one chanell, it runneth to Burtlehouse, and soone
after diuiding it selfe, one arme goeth by Bastian aliàs Brent bridge,
to High bridge, leauing Huntspill a market towne by southwest, the other
by Marke to Rokes bridge, Hebbes passage, and so into the sea, leauing a
faire Iland, wherin beside Brentmarsh are seuen or eight townes, of
whose names I haue no knowledge.</p>

<p>Now as touching the water that commeth from Welles, which falleth (as I
said) into the Coscombe water on the right hand of the Cawseie; you shall
vnderstand that as manie springs are in Wels, so the chiefe of them is
named Andres well, which riseth in a medow plat not farre from the east
end of the cathedrall church, and afterward goeth into the Coscombe, in
<span class="leftnote">Milton.<br />
Golafer.</span>
such place as I haue noted. Leland speaketh of the Milton &amp; Golafer
waters, which should fall likewise into the Brier: but whether those be
they whereof the one riseth aboue Staffordell, and in the descent
runneth by Shipton, Pitcombe, and so to Awnsford on the one side, as the
other dooth rise betwéene Batcombe and Vpton noble on the other halfe;
or vnto whether of them either of these names are seuerallie to be
attributed: as yet I doo not read.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[Page 115]</span></p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Axe. 2.</span>
The second Axe which commeth by Axe towne in old time called Vexa,
issueth out of Owkie hole, from whence it goeth by Owkie towne, afterward
<span class="leftnote"><br /><br style="line-height: 70%" />The Chederbrooke, driueth twelue miles within a quarter of
a mile of his head.</span>
meeting with the Chederbrooke that commeth from the Cheder rocks,
wherein is an hole in old time called Carcer Æoli, wherof much hath
béene written &amp; surmised past credit. It runneth by Were, Ratcliffe, and
after a little compasse into the northeast branch of the aforesaid riuer
last described, betweene Rokes bridge and Hebbes passage, as I haue
beene informed. From the fall of Axe we come to an other called Bane,
<span class="rightnote">Bane.</span>
northeast of Woodspring, whose head is about Banwell parke, or else in
<span class="leftnote"><br />Artro.</span>
Smaldon wood. Then to an other, and to the third, called Artro, which
riseth about Litton, and going by the Artroes, Vbbeie, Perribridge
(receiuing a rill yer it come thither from by south) beneath
Cungesbirie, or (as I learne) betwéene Kingston and Laurence Wike, it
méeteth with the sea.<br />
Sottespill water riseth betwéene Cheueleie and Naileseie, <span class="leftnote">Sottespill.</span>
howbeit it
hath no increase before it come into the sea at Sottespill, more than
<span class="rightnote">Cleueden.</span>
the next vnto it, which is named Cleueden water, of a certeine towne
neere to the fall thereof. It riseth southeast of Barrow, goeth by
<span class="leftnote">Auon. 3.</span>
Burton Naileseie, and so vnto Cleuedon. The Auon, commonlie called the
third Auon, is a goodlie water, and growne to be verie famous by sundrie
occasions, to be particularlie touched in our description of Bristow.
Yet thus much will I note héere thereof as a rare accident, how that in
king Edgars daies, the verie same yeare that the old monasterie of
Euesham fell downe by itselfe, a porpasse was taken therein neere to the
said monasterie, and neuer anie before or since that time heard of to
haue béene found in that streame. And euen so not manie yeares before I
<span class="leftnote">Sturgion taken in Rochester water.</span>
first wrote this treatise, a sturgion was taken aliue in Rochester
streame, which the bishop gaue vnto your honor, and you would as gladlie
haue sent it to the quéenes maiestie, if she might haue béene presented
withall aliue as it was taken. Certes both these rare occurrents gaue no
lesse occasion of strange surmises to the inhabitants of both places,
than the blockes of Brerton, when they appeare, doo vnto that familie;
of which the report goeth that they are neuer séene but against some
mischéefe or other to befall vnto that house. But how farre am I gone
from my purpose?</p>

<p>The Auon therefore riseth in the verie edge of Tetburie, and goeth by
long Newton to Brokenton, Whitchurch, and Malmsburie, where it receiueth
two waters, that is to saie, one from by west comming by Foreleie and
Bromleham, which runneth so néere to the Auon in the west suburbe of
Malmsburie, that the towne thereby is almost made an Iland. Another from
Okeseie parke by Hankerton, Charleton, and Garesden. After this
confluence it hasteth to Cole parke, then goeth it toward the southeast,
till it méet with a water comming from southwest (betwéene Hullauington
and Bradfield) by Aston: and soone after with another at the northside
from Binall by Wootton Basset (through the parke to Gretenham, and
Idouer bridges) and after the confluence to Dauntseie, Segar, Sutton,
Christmalford, Auon, Calwaies house, and then to west Tetherton. Beneath
this towne also it taketh in a water increased by two brookes, whereof
one comming from Cleue by Hilmarton, Whitleie house and Bramble (and
there receiuing another that commeth by Calne) passeth on by Stanlie
into the Auon, which from thencefoorth goeth to Chippenham, Rowdon,
<span class="leftnote">Cosham.</span>
Lekham, and then receiuing Cosham water, goeth to Lacocke, Melsham, and
yer it come at Whaddon, crosseth two other in one chanell, whereof one
riseth about Brumham house, and goeth to Sene, the other about the
Diuizes, and from thence runneth to Potterne wood, Creeke wood, Worton,
Maston, Bucklington, and ioining with the other aboue Litleton, they run
by Semmington, and north of Whaddon aforesaid into the maine streame,
whereof I now intreat. From hence our Auon runneth to Stauerton, and
<span class="leftnote">Were.</span>
southwest of that towne méeteth with the Were that commeth from Vpton by
<span class="leftnote"><br />Westbirie vnder the plaine,
neuer without a théefe or twaine.</span>
Dilton, Brooke parke (there crossing a rill called Bisse from Westbirie
vnder the plaine) then to north Bradleie, Trubridge, and so into Auon
that goeth from thence to Bradford, &amp; within a mile or thereabouts,
before it come at Freshford, it méeteth with the Frome, whose
description dooth insue.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Frome.</span>
The Frome riseth in the east part of Mendip hils, and from thence
runneth by Astwijc, the Cole pits, Lie vnder Mendip, Whateleie,
<span class="page"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[Page 116]</span>
<span class="rightnote"><br />Nonneie.</span>
Elmesbridge, and soone after taketh in the Nonneie water, comming from
Nonneie castell, thence to Walles and Orcharleie bridge, where it
receiueth a pretie brooke descending from Frome Selwood west of
Brackleie, increased with sundrie rils, whereof two come out of Selwood
forrest (and one of them from the Fratrie) another out of Long lead
parke, from Horningsham, and the fourth from Cosleie. Hence our Frome
goeth to Lullington, Beckington, Farleie castell, Bord and Fresh foord,
<span class="leftnote">Silling.</span>
and taking in the Silling brooke, falleth into the Auon beneath
Bradford, and east of Freshford. From thence going beneath Stoke, it
receiueth on the left hand a water comming from southwest, increased by
sundrie brookes, whereof one commeth from Camelet by Litleton, and
Dankerton, the other from Stone Eston, Midsummer Norton, by Welston,
Rodstocke, Wrigleton, Foscot, and Wellow, and there (taking in a rill
from Phillips Norton) it goeth by Clauerton to Hampton, and there it
méeteth with another water comming from Barthford, whose head is at
Litleton from whence it runneth by west Kineton to Castell combe (where
it ioineth with a rill rising by north from Litleton drue) and thence
commeth south to Slaughtenford, Haselburie, Box, Baithford, and so into
the Auon, which turning plaine west, hasteth to Baithwijc, and (meeting
with another in his passage from Caldaston) to Bath, the Tiuertons, and
Coston.</p>

<p>Héere also it taketh in a rill by the waie from Markesburie by Wilmerton
and Newton, and then going on to Sawford, it méeteth with one rill soone
<span class="leftnote">Swinford.</span>
west of Northstocke, named Swinford, and another by Bitton, from Durhain
by Wike, and so procéedeth still holding on his way to Caimsham, a towne
<span class="leftnote">Swinford parteth Summerset &amp; Glocestershires in sunder.</span>
in Summerset shire (so called of Caim an English saint, by whose
praiers, as the countrie once beléeued, all the adders, snakes and
serpents were turned into stone, their formes reserued, and for a
certeine space of ground about the said towne, and whereof some store as
yet is to be found in those quaries. But this miracle is so true as the
historie of Hilda, or that S. Patrike should chase all venemous
creatures out of Italie, with his staffe; or that maid Radegund should
driue the crowes to the pound, which did annoie hir corne while she went
vnto a chappell to heare &amp; sée a masse) where it crosseth the Chute,
which issueth at Winford, and goeth by bishops Chue to Penford, and
there receiueth the Clue comming from Cluton, and from thence to Chute,
&amp; so into the Auon. The Auon likewise after all these confluences goeth
to Briselton, and so to Bristow, beneath which it receiueth a rill on
each side (wherof one commeth from about Stoke lodge in Glocestershire,
being a faire water and running by Acton, Frampton, Hambroch, Stapleton,
and through Bristow, the other by south from Dundreie hill and towne, by
Bisport and Bedminster) and so descending yet lower, goeth to Rawneham
passage and Clifton, then by S. Vincents rocke and Laie, next of all to
Crocampill, and finallie into the sea, whither all waters by nature doo
resort.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Alderleie.</span>
Beside this water, Leland maketh mention of Alderleie brooke, which in
some ancient records is also called Auon, and runneth by Barkeleie. In
<span class="leftnote"><br />Douresleie.</span>
like maner he talketh of Douresleie becke, whose principall head is in
Douresleie towne: howbeit he saith no thing of it more, than that it
<span class="leftnote"><br />Torworth.</span>
serueth sundrie tucking lucking milles, and goeth by Tortworth or foure
miles further, before it come at the Sauerne. Finallie, making mention
of an excellent quarrie of hard stone about Douresleie, he telleth of
the Tortworth becke, that runneth within a flight shot of Barkeleie
towne, and falleth on the left hand into Sauerne marches, taking with
all the Alderleie or Auon, except I mistake his meaning, which may soone
be doone among his confused notes.</p>

<small>THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SAUERNE, &amp; SUCH WATERS AS
DISCHARGE THEMSELUES<br /> INTO THE SAME.</small><br />

CHAP. XIII.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">Sauerne.</span>
The Sauerne which Ptolomie calleth Sabriana, Tacitus Sabrina, diuideth
England or that part of the Iland, which sometime was called Lhoegres
from Cambria, so called of Camber, the second sonne of Brute, as our
histories doo report. But now that region hight Wales, of the Germane
word Walsh, whereby that nation dooth vse to call all strangers without
respect of countrie. This riuer tooke the name of a certeine ladie,
called Habren or Hafren, base daughter to Locrinus begotten vpon
Estrildis daughter to Humber otherwise called Cumbrus or Vmar, and for
which some write Chonibrus king of Scithia, that sometime inuaded this
Island, and was ouerthrowne here in the daies of this Locrinus, as shall
be shewed at hand: although I suppose rather that this ladie was called
Ine, and that the word Sabrina is compounded of Aber and Ine, and the
letter S added "Propter euphoniam:" for the mouth or fall of euerie
riuer in the British spéech is called Aber, whereby Aber Ine is so much
to saie as, the fall of Ine. But let vs returne againe to our discourse
of Humber or Vmar, which is worthie to be remembred.</p>

<p>For after the death of Locrinus, it came to passe that Guendolena his
wife ruled the kingdome in the nonage of hir sonne: and then getting the
said Estrildis and Habren hir daughter into hir hands, she drowned them
both in this riuer. And in perpetuall remembrance of hir husbands
disloialtie towards hir, she caused the streame to be called Habren of
the yoong ladie, for which the Romans in processe of time for readinesse
and mildnesse of pronunciation, wrote Sabrina, and we at this time doo
pronounce the Sauerne. Of the drowning of the said Abren also I find
these verses insuing:</p>

<p class="ind1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fluuium præcipitatur Abren,<br />
Nomen Abren, fluuio de virgine, nomen eidem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nomine corrupto deinde Sabrina datur.</p>

<p>But to returne to our Sauerne. It falleth into the maine sea betweene
Wales and Cornewall, which is and shall be called the Sauerne sea, so
long as the riuer dooth keepe hir name. But as the said streame in
length of course, bountie of water, and depth of chanell commeth farre
behind the Thames: so for other commodities, as trade of merchandize,
plentie of cariage, &amp; store of all kind of fish, as salmon, trouts,
breames, pikerell, tench, perch, &amp;c: it is nothing at all inferiour or
second to the same. Finallie, there is nothing to be discommended in
this riuer, but the opennesse thereof in manie places to the weather,
whereby sundrie perils oft ouertake such as fish or saile in small
vessels on the same.</p>

<p>The head of this noble streame is found in the high mounteines of south
Wales called Helennith or Plim limmon; in English, the blacke mounteins,
or moore heads, from whence also the Wie and the Rhidoll do procéed: and
therefore these thrée waters are commonlie called the thrée sisters, and
haue in latitude two and fiftie degrees ten minutes, in longitude
fiftéene and fiftie, as the description inferreth. So soone as it is out
of the ground, it goeth southeastward, till it come within a mile of
Laundlos, where it receiueth a chanell from by south southwest, called
the Dulas, which commeth thereinto on the south side, &amp; southwest of Lan
Idlos. It riseth (as it should séeme) of diuerse heads in the edge of
Radnorshire, and taking in sundrie small rilles, it meeteth at the last
<span class="leftnote">Brueham.</span>
with the Brueham brooke, and so they go togither till they fall into the
<span class="rightnote"><br />Clewdogh.</span>
Sauerne. Beneath Lan Idlos it taketh in the Clewdogh, from northwest, a
water producted by the influence of foure pretie brookes, whereof one is
<span class="leftnote">Bacho.<br />
Dungum.<br />
Lhoid.</span>
<span class="rightnote"><br />Bigga.<br />
Couine.</span>
called Bacho, another Dungum comming out of lin Glaslin, the third Lhoid
rising in lin Begilin, and the most southerlie called Bigga. After which
confluence our Sauerne procéedeth on by Berhlaid toward Landiman, taking
in by the waie, on the east side the Couine, thence to Cairfuse castell,
<span class="page"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[Page 118]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Carnon.<br />
Taran.</span>
where it meeteth with the Carnon, and the Taran both in one chanell, and
going not far from the aforesaid fortresse. After this it crosseth the
<span class="leftnote"><br />Hawes.<br />
Dulesse 2.</span>
Hawes on the north halfe beneath Aberhawes, next of all the Dulesse that
riseth in the edge of Radnor shire, and méeteth with it before it come
at Newton in Powisie, otherwise called Trenewith, as I find in British
language. Being come to Trenewith, I cannot eschue (right honorable) to
giue one note, as by the waie, touching the originall of my ladie your
bedfellowes ancestrie, which came from hence, &amp; were surnamed Newtons
onelie, for that the grandfather of sir John Newton either dwelled or
was borne there: otherwise the right name is Caradoc, for which some doo
corruptlie write Cradocke, respecting rather the shortnesse of
pronuntiation, than the true orthographie and writing of the word.
Certes the Caradockes haue béene, and yet are a linage of great honor,
antiquitie, and seruice; their lands also sometime belonged (for the
most part) to the noble Connoanies of Summersetshire: but in what order
they descended to the Newtons, in good sooth I cannot tell. But to
procéed with our riuer, which being past Newton, runneth foorth by
<span class="leftnote">Mule.</span>
Landilouarne, and so foorth on till it come to the fall of the Mule,
whose head is in the edge of Radnor also, and thereto his passage by
Kerie and Lanmereiwijc. After this also it procéedeth further till it
<span class="leftnote">Kenlet.<br />
Camalet.<br />
Tate.</span>
meet with the Kenlet or the Camalet, which taketh in also the Tate or
Tadbrooke water rising out of the hilles a mile from Bishops towne, the
whole course thereof being about seauen miles from the head (as I haue
often heard.) Of this also I find two descriptions, whereof one I borrow
out of Leland, who saith that it is a pretie brooke, running in the vale
by Mountgomerie, and comming within halfe a mile of the place where
Chirbirie priorie stood, it falleth into the Sauerne about a mile from
thence. Of the rilles (saith he) that run from the hilles thorough
Mountgomerie, which are a mile from the Sauerne shore, and likewise of
<span class="leftnote">Lan Idlos.</span>
the Lan Idlos brooke that méeteth withall within foure miles of the
head, I speake not, but thinke it sufficient to touch those of some
estimation, onelie leauing the rest to such as maie hereafter deale with
things more particularlie as time and trauell maie reueale the truth to
them. And hitherto Leland, whose words I dare not alter. But another
noteth this Camalet or Kenlet to run by More, Liddiom, Sned,
Churchstocke, Chirbirie, Walcote, and Winsbirie, and so into the
Sauerne.</p>

<p>From hence then, and after this confluence it goeth on by Fordon,
Leighton, and Landbreuie toward Meluerleie, and there it méeteth with
<span class="leftnote">Tanet.</span>
sundrie waters in one chanell, whereof the one called the Tanet is a
<span class="rightnote">Peuereie or Murnewie.</span>
verie pretie water (whereinto the Peuereie or Murneweie doth fall, which
descendeth from the hilles by west of Matrafall not farre from Lhan
<span class="leftnote">Auernie.</span>
Filin) the other Auernie, and ioining beneath Abertannoth, or aboue
Lannamonach neere unto the ditch of Offa, it is not long yer they méet
<span class="leftnote">Mordant.</span>
with the Mordant brooke, and there loose their names so soone as they
ioine and mix their waters with it. The head of the Mordant issueth out
of the Lanuerdan hilles, where diuerse saie, that the parish church of
crosse Oswald or Oswester sometimes stood. Certes, Oswester is thirtéene
miles northwest from Shrewesburie, and conteineth a mile within the
walles. It hath in like sort foure suburbs or great stréetes, of which
one is called Stratlan, another Wuliho, the third Beterich, wherein are
one hundred and fortie barns standing on a row belonging to the citizens
or burgesses, and the fourth named the Blackegate stréet, in which are
thirtie barns mainteined for corne and haie. There is also a brooke
<span class="leftnote">Simons becke.</span>
running thorough the towne by the crosse, comming from Simons well, a
bow shoote without the wall; &amp; going vnder the same betweene Thorowgate
&amp; Newgate, running vnder the Blacke gate. There is another, ouer whose
<span class="leftnote">Bederich.</span>
course the Baderikes or Bederich gate standeth, and therefore called
Bederich brooke. The third passeth by the Willigate or Newgate, &amp; these
fall all togither with the Crosse brooke, a mile lower by south into the
Mordant that runneth (as I said) by Oswester. From hence also it goeth
to Mordant towne, and betwéene Landbreuie and Meluerleie doth fall into
the Sauerne. After this our principall streame goeth to Sheauerdon
castell, Mountford, and Bicton chappell: and here it receiueth a water
on the left hand, that riseth of two heads, whereof one is aboue Merton,
the other at Ellismere, and ioining betweene Woodhouses &amp; Bagleie, the
<span class="page"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[Page 119]</span>
confluence runneth on by Radnall, Halton, Teddesmer, Roiton, Baschurch,
Walford, Grafton, Mitton, and so into the Sauerne. From hence it runneth
to Fitz, Eton, or Leiton, Barwijc, vpper Rossall, Shelton, and so to
Shrewsburie, where it crosseth the Mele water, whose head (as I heare)
is said to be in Weston.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Mele.</span>
The Mele therefore rising at Weston, goeth by Brocton, Worthen, Aston
<span class="leftnote"><br />Haberleie.</span>
Pigot, Westleie, Asterleie, and at Lea it méeteth with the Haberleie
water that commeth downe by Pontesford and Aunston. After this
confluence also it runneth to Newenham &amp; Crokemele, there taking in a
rill on the other side that descendeth by Westburie and Stretton, &amp;
thence going on to Hanwood, Noball, Pulleie, Bracemele, and
Shrewesburie, it falleth (as I said) into the open Sauerne. From hence
our Sauerne hasteth to Vffington, Preston, and betwéene Chilton and
Brampton taketh in the Terne, a faire streame and worthie to be well
handled; if it laie in me to performe it. This riuer riseth in a mere
beside Welbridge parke, néere vnto Ternemere village in Staffordshire.
From whence it runneth by the parkes side to Knighton, Norton, Betton,
and at Draiton Hales crosseth with a water comming from about Adbaston
(where maister Brodocke dwelleth) and runneth by Chippenham and Amming:
<span class="leftnote">Terne.</span>
so that the Terne on the one side, and this brooke on the other, doo
<span class="rightnote">* Sée Hen. 6. pag. 649</span>
inclose a great part of *Blore heath, where a noble battell was
somtime purposed betwéene king Henrie the sixt, and the duke of Yorke:
but it wanted execution.</p>

<p>But to procéed. After this confluence, it runneth to Draiton Hales,
Ternehill bridge: and yer long taking in a rill from Sandford by
Blechleie, it goeth to Stoke Allerton, Peplaw, and Eaton, where it
crosseth with a brooke that riseth about Brinton, and going by Higham,
Morton, the great Mere, Forton, Pilson, Pickstocke, Keinton, Tibberton,
and Bolas, it ioineth with the said Terne not farre from Water Vpton.
Thence passing to Crogenton, it méeteth with another brooke that commeth
from Chaltwen Aston, by Newport, Longford, Aldneie, and so through the
Wilde moore to Kinsleie &amp; Sléepe, and finallie into the Terne, which
hasteth from thence to Eston bridge, and néere vnto Walcote taketh in
<span class="leftnote">Roden.</span>
the Roden. This water riseth at Halton in Cumbermere lake: and comming
to Ouenleie, crosseth a rill from Cowlemere by Leniall. Thence it goeth
to Horton, and (ioining with another rill beneath Nonlaie that commeth
from Midle) runneth on to Wen, Aston, there crossing a rill beneath
Lacon hall from Prées ward, and so to Lée, Befford, Stanton, Morton,
Shabrée, Painton, Roden, Rodington, and then into Terne, that runneth
from thence by Charlton, Vpton, Norton, Barwijc, Acham, and so into the
Sauerne two miles beneath Shrewesburie (as I wéene.)</p>

<p>Thus haue I described the Terne in such wise as my simple skill is able
to performe. Now it resteth that I proceed on (as I maie) with the
Sauerne streame, with which, after this former confluence, it goeth vnto
Roxater or Roxcester, Brampton, Eaton vpon Sauerne, Draiton, where it
<span class="leftnote">Euerne.</span>
ioineth with the Euerne that runneth from Frodesleieward by Withiall and
Pitchford, Cresfedge, Garneston, Leighton, and betwéene the two
<span class="leftnote">Wenlocke or Rhe.</span>
Bildasses crosseth the Rhe or Wenlocke water, and so goeth on to
Browsleie and Hoord parke, where it vniteth it selfe with another brooke
to be described in this place, whilest the Sauerne rests, and recreates
it selfe here among the plesant bottoms.</p>

<p>This water ariseth aboue Tongcastell, and yer it haue run anie great
distance from the head, it méeteth with a rill comming by Sheriffe
Hales, and Staunton. Thence it goeth on to Hatton, Roiton, and there
crossing another from Woodhouses, comming by Haughton and Euelin, it
<span class="leftnote">Worfe.</span>
procéedeth to Beckebirie and Higford, and not omitting here to crosse
the Worfe (sometime a great streame that runneth vnto it out of Snowdon
poole) and so passeth foorth to Badger, Acleton, Worffield: a litle from
whence (about Wickin) it taketh in another brooke into it called Churle,
&amp; so goeth on to Rindleford, and then into Sauerne somwhat aboue
Bridgenorth at Penston mill (except mine information deceiue me.) From
Bridgenorth our Sauerne descendeth to Woodburie, Quatford, and there
<span class="leftnote">Marbrooke.</span>
taking in the Marbrooke beneath Eaton that riseth aboue Collaton, and
goeth by Moruill &amp; Vnderton, it runneth by Didmanston, Hempton, Aueleie,
&amp; beneath in the waie to Bargate, crosseth with a brooke comming from
<span class="page"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[Page 120]</span>
Vpton parke, by Chetton, Billingsleie, and Highleie, which being
admitted, it holdeth on to Areleie, Ciarnewood parke, Hawbach and
<span class="leftnote">Dowlesse.</span>
Dowlesse. Here also it méeteth with the Dowlesse water, a pretie brooke
issuing out of the Cle hilles in Shropshire, verie high to looke vpon,
and thrée miles or thereabouts from Ludlow, which runneth through
<span class="leftnote">Lempe.</span>
Clebirie parke in Wire forrest, &amp; taking withall the Lempe, dooth fall
into the Sauerne not far from Bewdleie.</p>

<p>But to procéed. From Bewdleie our Sauerne hasteth directlie to Ribford,
<span class="leftnote">Stoure.</span>
Areleie and Redston, and here it méeteth with a water called Stoure,
descending from Elie, or out of the ponds of Hales Owen in
Worcestershire, where it receiueth a rill from the left hand, and
another from the right, and then goeth on to Sturbridge (taking in there
the third water yer long running from Sturton castell) then to Kniuer
Whittenton, Ouerleie and Kidormister, aboue which it crosseth one
brookelet that commeth thither by Church hill, and another beneath it
that runneth by Belborow, betwixt which two waters lieth an od peece of
Staffordshire included, and also the Cle hill. From hence the aforesaid
Sauerne hasteth by Redston to Shrawleie; and aboue this towne receiueth
<span class="leftnote">Astleie.</span>
the Astleie water, as beneath the same it dooth another. From Witleie
then it goeth on to Holt castell, and so to Grimleie, taking in
<span class="rightnote">Doure.<br />
Sulwaie.</span>
thereabout with the Doure, and Sulwaie waters, whereof this riseth at
Chadswijc, and runneth by Stoke priorie, &amp; Droitwich, the other aboue
Chaddesleie, and commeth by Dourdale. After this it goeth foorth vnto
Worcester, in old time called Cair Brangon, or Cair Frangon, where it
<span class="leftnote">Tiber.</span>
méeteth with the Tiber, or Tiberton water, on the right hand aboue that
citie, and beneth it neere vnto Powijc with the Temde, whose description
shall be set downe before I procéed or go anie further with the Sauerne.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Temde.</span>
The Temde, or (as some name it) the Tame riseth vp in Radnorshire, out
of the Melenith hilles, and soone after his issue, méeting with a water
from Withall, it runneth to Begeldie, Lanuerwaterden, and so to
Knighton, which is fiue or six miles (as I heare) from his originall.
From Knighton it goeth ouer the ditch of Offa vnto Standish, and
<span class="leftnote">Clude.</span>
crossing a rill that commeth from betwéene the parke named Clude, (and
is a bound of Radnorshire) it goeth to Buckton, Walford, and Lanuarden,
where it meeteth with the Bardwell or Berfield, and the Clun, both in
one chanell, of which I find these descriptions here folowing word for
<span class="leftnote">Barfield.</span>
word in Leland. The Bardwell or Barfield riseth aboue New Chappell, in
<span class="leftnote"><br />Clun.</span>
the honour of Clun, hard by the ditch of Offa, and goeth by Bucknell.
The Clun issueth out of the ground betwéene Lhan Vehan and Maiston, and
going on by Bucton, Cluncastell, Clundon, Purslaw, and Clunbirie, it
crosseth with a brooke that runneth along by Kempton and Brampton.
Thence going foorth by Clunbirie, Brome, Abcot and Marlow, it méeteth
with the Bardwell, and so in the Temde, not verie far from Temderton. I
<span class="leftnote">Owke.</span>
suppose that Leland calleth the Bardwell by the name of Owke, but I will
not abide by it bicause I am not sure of it. After these confluences
therefore, our Temde goeth by Trippleton, Dounton, Burrington, and
<span class="leftnote">Oneie.</span>
Broomefield, where it méeteth with the Oneie, which is an indifferent
streame, and increased with sundrie waters, whereof I saie as followeth.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bow.</span>
The first of all is called the Bow. It riseth (as I learne) in the
hilles betwéene Hissington and Shelue, and from thence commeth downe by
<span class="leftnote"><br />Warren.</span>
Lindleie and Hardwijc, where it crosseth the Warren that issueth out of
the ground about Rotlie chappell, and runneth by Adston and Wentnor.
After the confluence also going on by Choulton and Cheinies, it taketh
<span class="rightnote">Queneie and Strabroke.</span>
in the Queneie and Strabroke both in one chanell, wherof the first
riseth at Lebotwood, and commeth downe by the Strettons, till it passe
by Fellanton. The second mounteth about Longuill, and goeth by
Rushburie, Newhall, Harton, and Alcaster, from whence it is not long yer
it fall into the Queneie, and so by Stratford into the Oneie, which hath
borne that name since the confluence of the Bow and Warren at Hardwijc,
whereof I spake before. Finallie, the Oneie which some call the
<span class="leftnote">Somergill.</span>
Somergill being thus increased, it runneth on to Hawford chappell,
Oneibirie, Broomefield, and so into Temde, and next of all to Ludlow.
<span class="leftnote">Corue.</span>
The Temde being thus brought to Ludlow, méeteth with the Corue, which
commeth thorough Coruedale from aboue Brocton by Morehouses, Shipton,
<span class="page"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[Page 121]</span>
Hungerford, and a little beneath taking in a rill that commeth by
Tugford, and Brencost castell, goeth on to Corsham castell, and there
crossing another from saint Margarets Clée, it hieth to Stanton Lacie,
and so likewise to Ludlow.</p>

<p>From Ludlow in like sort it goeth to Ludford, the Ashfordes, little
<span class="leftnote">Ladwich.</span>
Hereford, Burrington, and at Burfford vniteth it selfe with the Ladwich
that commeth beneath Milburne stoke, from betweene Browne, Cleehill, and
Stittertons hill, to Middleton, Henleie, Ladwich, Conam, and so into
Temde, which beneath Temdbirie receiueth another rill on the other side,
<span class="leftnote">Rhe.</span>
and the second on the left hand called Rhe, that commeth from aboue
Ricton, Staterton, Hound, Nene, Clebirie, Knighton, and then into the
Temde. From hence the Temde doeth goe by Astham, Lingridge, Shelleie
Welch, Clifton, Whitburne (and crossing a water that commeth from the
Sapies) to Knightwijc and Bradwaies. Hereabout againe it interteineth a
rill that descendeth from about Kidburie on the right hand, and goeth by
Collomatherne, Credeleie, Aufrike, and so into Temde, and then
procéeding forward, the said streame runneth to Braunford, and yer long
<span class="leftnote">Langherne.</span>
(taking in the Langherne that riseth about Martleie, and passeth by
Kengewijc) it goeth to Powijc, and so into the Sauerne before it come at
Wickecester.</p>

<p>Thus haue I brought all such streames before me that fall into the
Sauerne from the head, vntill I come to Powijc, wherof (as you may
easily perceiue) the Temde is the most excellent. Now it resteth that I
proceed with the rest of the discourse intended concerning this our
riuer. Certes, from Powijc mils which are about halfe a mile beneth
Worcester, the Sauerne runneth on to Kempseie and Cleueld, whence after
it hath crossed a brooke comming from Cowleie, it hasteth first to
Stoke, and so to Vpton, which is eleuen or twelue miles from Glocester,
whither it floweth manie times at high tides, but yer it come there, it
drowneth another fall descending from Maluerne hilles by Blackemoore
parke, &amp; soone after the third growing by two branches, wherof one
commeth also from Maluerne hils by little Maluerne and Welland, the
other from Elderford by Pendocke and Longdon. After these confluences in
like sort, it runneth to Bushelleie, and Tewkesburie, where it receiueth
the Auon, that followed next of all in order to be described, before I
procéed anie further in my discourse of Sauerne.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Auon 4.</span>
The Auon riseth at Nauesbie in the borders of Northamptonshire, a little
side hand of Gillesborow and foot of the hils whereon Nauesbie standeth,
and euen out of the church yard of the said village. From hence it goeth
to Welford, Stamford, Lilburne, Clifton, and Rugbie, by north whereof it
<span class="leftnote">Swiuethus.</span>
crosseth a water called Swift, which commeth from aboue Kimcote, to
Lutterworth, Browne ouer and Colsford. From thence also it goeth to
<span class="leftnote">Souus.</span>
Newbold, Wolston, Ruington, and betwéene the Stonlies taketh in the Sow.
This Sow is a pretie water comming from aboue Calendon to Whitleie, and
soone after méeting with a riueret from Couentrie, which some doo call
Shirburne water, it goeth thence to Bagginton, where it taketh in a rill
<span class="leftnote">Kinell.</span>
called Kinell, as I haue read from Kenelsworth, from whence it runneth
to Stonleie, &amp; so into the Auon. After this confluence the Auon
procéedeth on to Stonleie abbeie, Ashehow, Miluerton, Edmonds cote, and
appace to Warwijc.</p>

<p>But yer it come there, it méeteth from south east with two waters in one
chanell, whereof the least commeth to Marton from Bishops Itchington, by
Herburbirie and Thorpe, where it crosseth a rill from Southam. The other
<span class="leftnote">Leame.</span>
is called Leame, or Lime that descendeth from about Helladon, or néere
vnto Catesbie in Northamptonshire, and going by Ouencote, Braunston,
Lemington and Mertun, it ioineth with the other, and then go from thence
togither vnder the name of Leame, to Hunnington, Cobbington, and so into
the Auon, as I gaue notice before. At Warwike also the Auon taketh in a
water running northwest from Groue parke. Thence it goeth on to
Bereford, and there crossing another from Shirburne, it passeth forth to
Bishops Hampton, méeting finallie with the third, from Kineton that
runneth by Walton and Charlecote. After this last rehearsed confluence,
it hasteth to Stretford vpon Auon, and then to Luddington ward, where it
<span class="leftnote">Stoure.</span>
taketh in the Stoure that riseth aboue Cherington, &amp; whose course from
thence is such, as that being once past the head, it goeth by Weston, and
<span class="page"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[Page 122]</span>
yer long crossing a water from Campden, hanging Aston, &amp; Todnam, it
runneth to Barcheston, Aldermaston, Clifford, &amp; so into the Auon.
From hence then the said Auon goeth to Luddington, Burton, Bitford, and
Cleue, and being parted from the said towne, yer it come at Sawford, it
<span class="leftnote">Arow.</span>
receiueth the Arow or Aur, which rising in the blacke hils in
Worchestershire, commeth by Alchurch, Beleie parke, Ypsleie, Studleie,
<span class="leftnote">Alne.</span>
and then taking in another rill called Alne, out of Fecknam forrest, and
going by Coughton parke, it hasteth to Alcester, Arow, Ragleie,
Wheteleie, Bouington, Standford, and so into Auon, which after this
conjunction goeth to Vffenton &amp; then to Eouesholme: but yer it come
there it receiueth two waters in one chanell, whereof the first riseth
about Willerseie, the other néere to Buckland, and ioining beneath
<span class="leftnote">Pludor.</span>
Badseie, they fall into Anon, vnder the name of Pludor brooke, before it
come to Eouesholme.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Vincélus.</span>
Being past Eouesholme it crosseth the Vincell, which rising out of the
hils somewhere about Sudleie, runneth two miles further to Winchelcombe,
and Gretton, and taking in a rill by the waie from Hailes, procéedeth on
(going within one quarter of a mile of Hailes abbaie) to Tuddington, or
Doddington, beneath which when it hath crossed another rill that commeth
from Stanwaie, it goeth to Wannington, Sedgeborow, and receiuing there
the last on the right hand also (as all aboue rehearsed) it falleth into
the Auon, when it is come by Hinton, vnto a towne called Hampton, or (as
some doo write it) Ampton. After this confluence the Auon goeth to
Charleton, to Crapthorne (and there taking in a rill on the left hand)
to Fladbirie wike, and almost at Persore bridge, méeteth with a branched
<span class="leftnote">Piddle.</span>
water that commeth by Piddle, whereof one head is at Alberton, an other
at Piddle. From Persore it goeth to Birlingham, and soone after carrieng
a brooke withall descending from Fakenham, by Bradleie, Himbleton,
Huddenton, Crowleie, Churchhill, Pibleton, Besseford and Desseford, it
fléeteth to Eckington, Bredon, Twining, Mitton, and Tewkesburie, where
it ioineth with the Sauerne.</p>

<p>Now to resume the course of the Sauerne, you shall vnderstand, that from
Tewkesburie it goeth to Derehirst, the How passage, and soone after
<span class="leftnote">Chilus.</span>
receiuing the Chiltenham water that commeth thither by Bodenton, Sawton,
and Norton, it runneth to Ashelworth, Sainthirst; and here it parteth it
selfe till it come to Glocester, where it vniteth it selfe againe. But
in the meane time the easterlie branch receiueth a forked chanell,
whereof one head is not far fr&#333; Leke Hampton, the other about
Witcombe, from whence it goeth to Brockworth. The other branch or arme
taketh in the Leadon that commeth downe by Preston, Dimmocke, Pantleie
<span class="leftnote">Leadon.</span>
vpper Leadon, Leadon court, and there taking in one rill that commeth
from Linton by Areknoll, and another beneath it from Tainton by Rudford,
it falleth into the said branch on the right side, before it come at
Glocester.</p>

<p>The Sauerne therefore being past Glocester, it méeteth with a litle rill
on the right hand, and thence holding on his course by Elmore,
Minsterworth, Longneie, to Framilode, it receiueth yer it come at this
<span class="leftnote">Strowd.</span>
latter the Strowd brooke, which rising not farre from Side, goeth by
Massade, Edgeworth, Frampton, Strowd, and receiuing there a water that
commeth from Panneswijc Lodge, by Pittescombe on the one side, and
another from Radbridge on the other, it prosecuteth his voiage to Stone
house, Eslington, white Misen, &amp; so toward Framilode, where the said
Strowd dooth fall into the Sauerne. After the fall of Strowd, the
Sauerne goeth from thence to Newenham, and Arlingham, and soone after
receiuing a water on each side, whereof one commeth from Vleie by Cham
and Chambridge, the other by Blackneie and Catcombe, it goeth foorth
till it méet with another water on ech side, whereof that on the English
halfe is forked, so that one head thereof is to be found about Borwell,
the other at Horton, and méeting aboue Tortworthie, they run by Stone
and Barkeleie castell, and so into the Sauerne. That on the Welsh halfe
<span class="leftnote">Newarne.</span>
is named Newarne, which cömeth from the forrest of Deane, and so into
the Sauerne.</p>

<small>OF SUCH WATERS AS FALL INTO THE SEA IN COMPASSE OF THE ILAND, BETWÉENE <br />THE SAUERNE AND THE HUMBER.</small><br />

CHAP. XIV.</h3>

<p>The Sauerne being thus described, it resteth that I go forward with the
names of those that lie vpon the coast of Southwales, making my entrie
at the ferrie ouer betwéene Aust in Glocestershire, and a village on the
further banke of Sauerne, not farre from Tarendacus chappell, in the
<span class="leftnote">Wie mouth.</span>
mouth of the riuer Wie, which ferrie is about three miles ouer (saith
<span class="rightnote">Guie aliàs Wie.</span>
Leland) or else my memorie dooth faile me. This riuer Guie or Wie
beginneth (as I said before) on the side of the hilles, where the
Sauerne dooth arise, and passing through Wenceland, that is, southeast
by Raiader Guie to Buelt (where the Irwon meeteth withall) it goeth to
Glasburie, Hereford, Monmouth, and finallie into the Sauerne sea at
Chepstow: for so they call Monhafren, which seuereth Wales from
Summersetshire, Deuonshire, Cornewall: as for the Rhidoll which is the
third sister, it hath the shortest course of all, for it runneth
northward, and into the sea at Aberistwith, which is not farre off, as
the writers doo report.</p>

<p>Leland writing of this riuer Guie or Wie saith thus; The Wie goeth
thorough all Herefordshire by Bradwarden castell, belonging to sir
Richard Vehan, and so to Hereford east, thence eight miles to Rosse, a
<span class="leftnote">Vmber a fish onelie in the Wie.</span>
market towne in Herefordshire: and in this riuer be vmbers, otherwise
called grailings. It is also found by common experience, that the salmon
of this riuer is in season, when the like fish to be found in all other
riuers is abandoned and out of vse; wherof we of the east parts doo not
a little maruell. But let vs not staie vpon these descriptions, sith an
other is come to my hand more exact than either of these.</p>

<p>The Guie therefore riseth out of the blacke mounteines of Wales, out of
which the Sauerne springeth in Radnorshire, and comming by Lhangerike,
<span class="leftnote">Darnoll.</span>
and Raiadargoie, it receiueth one rill from the west called Darnoll, and
another from by northeast comming by saint Harmon. Thence it goeth to
Lhanuthell, and in the waie betwixt Raiader and Lhanuthell, it ioineth
<span class="leftnote">Elland.</span>
with the Elland, whose head is néere to Comeristwith, and taketh
<span class="leftnote"><br />Clardwen.</span>
likewise into him the Clardwen that diuideth for a season Radnorshire
from Brecknoch, which Clardwen is likewise increased by the Clarthie
within thrée miles of his head and lesse, hauing his course from
southwest &amp; hille soile adiacent. From Lhanuthell it goeth west of
<span class="leftnote">Ithan.</span>
Dissart, where it receiueth the Ithan, a riuer rising aboue Lhanibister,
and from whence it runneth to Landwie, and Lambaderne vawr: beneath
which it crosseth a water on ech side, whereof that on the right hand
<span class="leftnote">Dulesse.<br />
Cluedoch.</span>
consisteth on the Dulesse and the Cluedoch, after their confluence: the
<span class="rightnote">Lamaron.</span>
other hight Lomaron, whose head is aboue Lanthangle, and in the forrest
of Blethwag. After these confluences, it runneth on crinkeling in
<span class="rightnote">Hawie.</span>
strange manner, vnder the name of Ithor, till it come to Dissart, taking
in the Hawie on the left side yer it come there, and then into the Wie
on the north side, which directeth his course further to Bealt, where it
<span class="leftnote">Yrwon.</span>
receiueth the Yrwon, a notable streame, descending from the hilles aboue
Lanihangle Abergwessen, and thence comming downe by Lanurid Lang marsh,
Lanauan, Vechan, Langantan, and so to Beth or Bealt, being inlarged by
<span class="rightnote">Weuereie.</span>
the waie with sundrie faire waters, as the Weuereie, whose head is about
Lanauan moore, the Dulasse, or (as some call it) the Dowlasse, that
<span class="leftnote">Dulasse.<br />
Comarch.<br />
Dulasse.</span>
commeth from the hilles west of the head of Weuereie. The Comarch whose
head and course is west of the Dowlasse on the north side, and likewise
by two other on the southwest, and Dilasse from by southwest, which last
rehearsed falleth into him halfe a mile and more aboue the influence of
the Comarch which lieth on the other side. After this our Yrwon goeth to
<span class="leftnote">Dehon.</span>
Lhanuareth, where it crosseth the Dehon on the southwest side, then to
<span class="rightnote">Edwie.</span>
Aberedwie, and there receiueth the Edwie on the northeast, which ariseth
in the hilles aboue Botins chappell, and commeth downe by Crigend and
Lanhaderne, thence the Guie goeth on to Lanstephan, and there (or a
<span class="rightnote"><br />Machaweie.</span>
little aboue) taketh in the Machaweie that commeth by castell Paine, and
<span class="page"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[Page 124]</span>
<span class="leftnote"><br />Leuenni.</span>
so going on in processe of time with the Leuenni, whereof Leland in his
commentaries doth write as here insueth.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Euer.<br />
Euerie.</span>
The Leuenni, otherwise called the Euer or Euerie, is a farre streame
rising in Welch Talgarth hard by Blaine Leuenni, among the Atterill
hilles, from whence it goeth to Brecknoch mere, which is two miles long,
and a mile broad, and where men doo fish in Vniligneis or botes of one
peece, as they doo in Lhin Seuathan, which is foure miles from Brecknoch.
Finallie bringing great store of red sand withall, and there with the
<span class="leftnote">Brennich.</span>
Brennich water (that hath his originall issue at Mennith gader, and is
<span class="rightnote">Trufrin.</span>
increased with the Trufrin) it falleth into the Wie aboue Glesbirie
three miles from Haie, at a place that of the onelie fall of this brooke
is named Aberleuenni, after this the Guie. Being come to Haie, a pretie
towne where much Romane coine is found, which they call Jewes monie: and
after it hath passed or crossed a little brooke, which commeth from
<span class="leftnote">Dulesse.</span>
Lanigon, it méeteth with the Dulesse that commeth also from the Atterill
by Kersop, and from thence goeth to Clifford castell (being now entred
into Herefordshire, and leauing Radnor, wherevnto it hath for a long
course béene march) then to the Whitneies, Winferton, Letton,
Bradwarden, Broberie, Monington, Biford, Bridgesalers, Eaton, Brinton,
and Hereford, without anie influence of riuer worthie of memorie, and
yet with manie windlesses, &amp; there méeteth with a water rising short of
Wormesleie, which goeth by Maunsell, Lacie, Brinsop, Crednell, Stretton,
and Huntington, and soone after into the Wie, beside a little rill that
runneth betwéene them both euen into Hereford towne. From hence in like
sort the Wie hasteth to Rotheras church, Hampton, and Mordeford, where
<span class="leftnote">Lug.</span>
it taketh in sundrie waters in one chanell, of which the Lug or Luie is
the principall, and next of all to be described, before I go anie
further with the course of the Wie, whereinto it dischargeth the
chanell. It riseth in the edge of the forrest of Kemples aboue Langunlo:
from whence it goeth to Momonacht, Pilleth Whitton, Fuldibrooke,
Prestaine, so into Herefordshire, where betwéene Bonie &amp; Beton, or
Bitton, it receiueth in the Somergill, whose crotched head being march
to Radnor forrest, directeth his streame betwéene the new and old
Radnors, to Knill, to Nash, and so into the Lug, which presentlie
passeth by Kinsham, Shirleie, Ailmister, Kingsland, Eaton chappell, and
so into Lemister, where it crosseth the Oneie (a streamelet rising short
of Shobden, and going by Chorlester) a little before it come to the west
side of the towne.</p>

<p>At Lemister it selfe in like sort three waters doo méet, and almost
<span class="leftnote">Pinsell.</span>
inuiron the towne, that is to saie, the Lug, the Pinfulleie or Pinsell
<span class="leftnote"><br />Kenbrooke.</span>
(a riueret rising at Kingsland two miles from Lemister) &amp; the Kenbrooke,
which commeth out of the blacke mounteins, from Lemister, otherwise
called Leofminster, of the builder, and also Leonminster, the Lug or
Luie goeth on to Eaton, and there taketh in a rill beneath Hampton, and
aboue Hope, whereof one head is betwéene Hatfield and Bickleton, another
néere vnto Marston, and méeting of both at Humber. From Hampton it goeth
to Bodenham, Wellington, Morton, Sutton, Shelwijc, Lugwardin, and
<span class="leftnote">Fromeie.</span>
Longward, where it crosseth the Fromeie or Frome, a pretie water, and
worthie to be remembred. It riseth about Wolferelaw, from whence it
commeth downe toward the southest by Edwinsloch to Bromyard, Auenburie,
Bishops Frome, Castell Frome, Can Frome, to Stretton vpon Frome, and
<span class="leftnote">Loden aliàs Acton.</span>
there taking in a water called Loden, comming from aboue Bishops
Grendon, by Pencombe, Cowarne, Stoke Lacie, Cowarne, and Engleton, our
Frome goeth on to Yarkeleie, Dornington, and Longward, and so into the
Lug, betwéene Longward and Suston, which runneth foorthwith to Mordford,
or Morthford, and there into the Wie, vnto whose description I now
returne againe.</p>

<p>Being come therefore vnto Mordford, it goeth to Fawnehope, Hamlacie,
<span class="leftnote">Treske.</span>
Ballingham, Capull regis, where it receiueth a water called Treske, from
little Berch by Treske, Fawleie, How, Capull Inkeston, Foie, Brampton,
Bridstow, Wilton castell, the Rosse, and there a rill from Bishops
Vptonward by Rudhall, Weresend, Ham, Glewston, Godderich, here in like
sort meeting with another that commeth from Ecleswall in the confines of
Glocestershire, by Peniard castell &amp; Coughton, to Welch Bicknor, English
Bicknor, Huntesham, including a parcell of Monmouthshire, being an
outliggand, as ye may find in that parcell of Herefordshire which butteth
<span class="page"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[Page 125]</span>
vpon Glocestershire (as you shall find the like péece of Herefordshire
in the confines of Salop and Worcester, wherein Rochford standeth,
beside manie other which I haue elsewhere spoken of) Whitchurch, where
<span class="leftnote">Gainar.</span>
it taketh in Gainar water that commeth from Much Birch, by Lanwarne,
<span class="leftnote">Garran.</span>
Michaell church, and at Langarran crosseth the Garran brooke, that
riseth in Gregwood, short of Arcop, six miles from Monemouth by
northwest: after which these two doo runne as one to Marston, and almost
Whitchurch, and so into the Wie, which goeth from thence to Gunnarew, S.
Michaell, Dixton, and Monemouth, where I will staie a while, till I haue
described the Mone, next of all to be remembred here.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Mona.</span>
The Mona or Monbecke, riseth in the forrest of Hene, twentie miles from
Monemouth by west in Eirisland, and going by Creswell, or Craswall
chappell not farre from the marches of Brecknocke, and northeast of
Hatuill hils, which after it hath run a good distance from the head
<span class="leftnote">Eskill.</span>
receiueth first the Eskle, and passeth by Lanihangle and the old Court,
<span class="rightnote">Elkon.</span>
from northweast, then the Olcon, from southwest, which méeteth withall
néere Cledoll or Knedoch, &amp; passing by the old towne, it hasteth to
Altrinis, where it becommeth march betwéene Hereford and Monemouth
shires, and taketh in a water comming by Trewin, &amp; likewise the Hordwie
<span class="leftnote">Hodneie.</span>
or Hodneie which riseth in Becknocke, among the Saterelles, &amp; runneth by
Capell a fin, Lantonie, Cumroie, Michaell church in Monemouthshire, and
ioineth with our Mona at Altrinis, which after this confluence hasteth
to Walderstone, Lansillo Langua, betwéene which and Kinechurch it ioineth
<span class="leftnote">Doure.</span>
with the Doure that riseth about the Bache aboue Dourston, which is six
miles aboue Doure abbie, so that it runneth through the Gilden dale, by
Peterchurch, Fowchurch, Morehampton, Newcourt, Doure, and beneath Doure
<span class="rightnote">Dulesse.</span>
taketh in the Dulesse, from southwest and Lanihangle, by Harleswas
<span class="leftnote">Wormesbecke.</span>
castell on the one side, and yer long the Wormesbecke, descending from
aboue Keuernall by Didleie, Deuerox, Workebridge, and Kenderchurch on
the other, and so running all in one chanell vnto Mona, that riuer goeth
on to Kinech church, Grismond, Cardwaie, Skenfrith, Warnethall,
Perthire, and so to Monemouth, where it meeteth with the Wie, ouer each
of which riuers Monemuth towne hath his particular bridge.</p>

<p>The Guie or Wie therefore being increased with thus manie brookes and
waters, passeth on from hence, and going toward Landogo, it méeteth with
<span class="leftnote">Trollie.</span>
the Trollie becke, whose head is aboue Lannam ferrie in the north part
of Monemouth shire, and goeth from thence by Lhantellio, Lanihangle,
Gracedieu, Diggestow, Wonastow, Troie, and so into Wie, that runneth
<span class="leftnote">Elwie.</span>
also by Wies wood chase, taking in there the Elwie that commeth from
aboue Landelwie by Langowen, Lannissen, Penclase, Trilegh, and Langogo,
where méeting with the aforesaid streame, the Wie directeth his course
from thence by Tinterne abbeie (where it crosseth a rill from Trile
grange) Chapell hill, Parcasicke, Penterie chapell, Lancante, Chepstowe,
and so into the sea, leauing the Treacle (a chappell standing on a
rocke) on the hand betweene it &amp; Sauerne, ouer against the point that
lieth south of Betteslie. Next vnto the Wie, I find a rill of no great
course, comming downe from Mounton chappell, by a place of the bishops
of Landaffe. Thence passing by Charston rocke, and the point whereon
<span class="leftnote">Trogie.</span>
Trinitie chappell standeth, I come vnto the fall of Trogie, which riseth
short of Trogie castell, and runneth toward the sea, by Landuair,
Dewston, Calicot, and so into the Ocean, ouer against the Charston
rocke. The next fall is of a water that commeth from aboue Penho by saint
<span class="rightnote">Dennie Iland in the middest of the Sauerne,
and likewise another litle one called Beuerage.</span>
Brides, north and by west of Dennie Iland, which lieth midwaie betweene
that fall &amp; Porshot point, and before I touch at Goldcliffe point, I
crosse another fall of a fresh brooke, whose head is aboue Landueigo in
Wencewood, and course by Lhanbed, Langston, Lhanwarme, and through the
More to Witston.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Wiske.</span>
Next vnto this is the Aberwish, or Wiske, in Latine Osca, whereon
Caerleon standeth, sometime called Chester and Ciuitas legionum, bicause
the Romans soiourned there, as did afterward Arthur the great, who also
held a noble parlement in the same, whereof Galfride maketh mention Lib.
7. cap. 4. affirming thereto, that in those daies the maiestie thereof
was such, as that all the forefronts of their houses were in maner laid
<span class="page"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[Page 126]</span>
ouer with gold, according to the Romane vsage. There was in the same in
like sort a famous vniuersitie, wherein were 200 philosophers; also two
goodlie churches erected in the remembrance of Iulius and Aaron, two
Brittish martyrs, whereby it might well be reputed for the third
metropoliticall sée in Britaine. But to our water, whereof I read that
it is furthermore one of the greatest in Southwales, and huge ships
might well come to the towne of Caerleon, as they did in the time of the
Romans, if Newport bridge were not a let vnto them; neuerthelesse, big
botes come thereto. It is eight Welsh or twelue English miles from
Chepstow or Strigull, and of some thought to be in base Wenceland,
though other be of the contrarie opinion. But howsoeuer the matter
standeth, this riuer is taken to be the bounds of Brechnockshire, as
Renni is middle to Wenceland &amp; Glamorganshire. But to leaue these
by-matters, and come to the description of the water.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Vske.</span>
You shall vnderstand that the Vske or Wiske, in Latin Osca riseth in the
blacke mounteins ten miles aboue Brechnocke toward Carmardine, the hill
being properlie called Yminidh Duy out of which it falleth, and situate
in the verie confines betwéene Brechnocke and Carmardine shires, from
whence winding into the northeast, it commeth to Trecastle, and in the
<span class="leftnote">Craie.</span>
waie betwéene it and Capell Ridburne, it taketh in the Craie brooke, on
the right hand before it come to Ridburne chappell. Going also from
<span class="leftnote">Sennie.</span>
thence toward Deuinocke, it crosseth the Senneie on the same side (which
<span class="rightnote">Camblas.<br />
Brane.</span>
riseth aboue Capell Senneie) next of all the Camblas, &amp; at Aberbraine,
the Brane, or the Bremich, whose head is thrée miles from Brechnocke,
and running by Lanihangle, it méeteth I saie with the Vske, about master
<span class="leftnote">Yster.</span>
Awbries manor. Beneath Aber Yster, it receiueth the Yster, which riseth
northwest aboue Martyr Kinoch, and commeth by Battell chappell, and
going from thence by Lanspithed and Newton, it runneth in the end to
<span class="leftnote">Hodneie.</span>
Brechnocke, where it taketh in the Hodneie or Honthie on the one side,
whose head is in Blaine Hodneie, and comming downe from thence by
Defrune chappell, Lanihangle and Landiuilog, it méeteth with the Vske or
Brechnocke townes end, which of the fall of this water was sometime
called Aberhodni, as I haue beene informed: on the other halfe likewise
<span class="leftnote">Tertarith.</span>
it receiueth the Tertarith that riseth among the Bane hils, fiue miles
from Brechnocke, and commeth likewise into the verie suburbs of the
towne, beneath Trenewith, or new Troie, whereby it taketh the course.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Kinuricke.</span>
After these confluences, the Vske procéedeth on toward Aberkinurike, or
the fall of a water whose head is in the roots of Menuchdennie hill, and
passage by Cantreffe. Thence it goeth by Lanhamlaghe, Penkethleie
castell, Lansanfreid, Landettie, Langonider, and soone after receiuing
<span class="leftnote">Riangall.</span>
the Riangall (which riseth about the hill whereon Dinas castell
standeth, and runneth by Lanihangle and Tretoure) it passeth betwéene
Laugattocke and Cerigkhowell, to Langroinie, and there about crosseth
<span class="leftnote">Groini.</span>
the Groinie brooke, that descendeth from Monegather, Arthur hill, by
Peter church, as I find. When the Vske is past this brooke, it taketh in
thrée other short rils, from by south within a little distance, whereof
<span class="rightnote">Cledoch Vaur.<br />
Fidan.<br />
Cledochveh&#257;.</span>
the first hight Cledoch Vaur, the second Fidan, and the third
Cledochvehan. Of these also the last falleth in néere to Lanwenarth.
From hence the Vske runneth to Abergeuenni towne, where it méeteth
<span class="leftnote"><br />Kebbie.</span>
with the Kebbie water from by north, that riseth short of Bettus
<span class="rightnote"><br />Geuenni.</span>
chappell aboue the towne, and the Geuennie that descendeth from aboue
Landilobartholl beneath not farre from Colbroke, and so goeth on to
Hardwijc, beneath which it crosseth thrée namelesse rilles, on the right
hand or southwest side before it come at Lanihangle vpon Vske, of whose
courses I know not anie more than that they are not of anie length, nor
the chanell of sufficient greatnesse seuerallie to intreat of. Betwéene
<span class="leftnote">Birthin.</span>
Kemmeis and Trostreie it meeteth with such an other rill that commeth
<span class="rightnote">Caer Vske standeth on one side of
Vske, and Caerleon on the other, but Caer Vske
by diuerse miles further into the land.</span>
downe by Bettus Newith. Thence it goeth to Caer Vske or Brenbigeie
(whose bridge, I mene that of Vske, was ouerthrowne by rage of this
riuer, in the six and twentith yeare of king Henrie the eight, vpon
saint Hughes daie after a great snow) but yer it come there, it
receiueth the Birthin on the right hand, which is a pretie water,
descending from two heads, whereof the first is northwest of Manihilot,
as the other is of Lanihangle and Pentmorell.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Elwie.</span>
Next vnto this it ioineth with the Elwie aboue Lanbadocke, whose head is
<span class="page"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[Page 127]</span>
east of Penclase, and running westwards by Penclase, Lanislen, Langowen
(and beneath Landewie taking in a brooket from Ragland castell, that
commeth downe thither by Ragland parke) it bendeth southwest, vntill it
come at the Vske, which crinkling towards the south, and going by
Lanhowell, méeteth with three rilles before it come to Marthenie
chappell, whereof the first lieth on the right hand, and the other on
the left: the midlemost falling into the same, not farre from
Lantressen, as I haue béene informed. From the mouth of the Romeneie to
the mouth of the Taffe are two miles. Certes the Taffe is the greatest
riuer in all Glamorganshire, (called by Ptolomie Rhatostathybius, as I
gesse) and the citie Taffe it selfe of good countenance, sith it is
indued with the cathedrall see of a bishop. The course of the water in
like maner is verie swift, and bringeth oft such logs and bodies of
trées withall from the wooddie hilles, that they doo not seldome crush
the bridge in péeces, but for so much as it is made with timber it is
repaired with lighter cost, wheras if it were of hard stone, all the
countrie about would hardlie be able to amend it. It riseth in
Brechnockshire among the woodie hilles, from two heads, whereof one is
in Monuchdenie, the other west of that mounteine, of which the first
called Taffe vaure, goeth by Capell lan vehan, Vainor, and Morlais, the
other by Capell Nantie, and ioining at southwest beneath Morlais castle,
they go to Martyr Tiduill, and toward Lannabor, but by the waie it
taketh in from northwest a brooke called Cunnon, which commeth out of
Brechnockshire by Abardare, and afterward the Rodneie comming out of the
same quarter (but not out of the same shire) which runneth by
Estridinodoch, a crotched brooke, &amp; therefore diuided into Rodneie
vaure, &amp; Rodneie vehan, that being ioined with the Taffe, doth run on
withall to Eglefilian, castle Coch, Whitchurch, Landaffe, Cardiffe, and
so into the sea, not far from Pennarth point, where also the Laie dooth
bid him welcome vnto his chanell or streame. Furthermore, from
Marthellie it hasteth to Kemmeis, and yer it come at Caerleon or Chester
in the south, taketh in two waters on the right hand, of which the first
commeth downe from the north betweene Landgwie, Landgweth, and by Lhan
Henoch, without anie further increase: but the other is a more
beautifull streame, called Auon, and thus described as I find it among
<span class="leftnote">Auon.</span>
my pamphlets. The Auon riseth in the hilles that séeme to part Monemouth
and Brechenocke shires in sunder, and after a rill receiued from
Blorench hill on the northside of the same, running downe from thence by
Capell Newith and Triuethin, it receiueth a water from by south almost
of equall course, and from that quarter of the countrie, and in processe
of time another little one from the same side, yer it come to Lanurgwaie
and Lanihangle, from whence it goeth to Guennocke and Penrose, &amp; so in
Vske before it go by Caerleon. But here you must note, that the course
of this streame ioining beneath Quenocke chappell, with the other which
descendeth (as I said) from the hilles about foure miles aboue Landgwaie
and Langweth, dooth make an Iland aboue Caerleon, where Penrose
standeth, &amp; much Romane coine is found of all sorts, so that the
influence of the one into the other séemeth to me to be but a draine
deuised by man, to kéepe the citie from the violence of such water as
otherwise would oft annoie the same.</p>

<p>Being past Caerleon it runneth to Crindie, where maister Harbert
dwelleth, and there carieng another brooke withall, that riseth north of
Tomberlow hill, and descendeth by Henlis and Bettus chappell, it runneth
forth to Newport (in Welch castle Newith) and from thence vnder a bridge,
<span class="leftnote">Ebowith.</span>
after thrée or foure miles course to the sea, taking the Ebowith water
withall, which méeteth with the same almost in the verie mouth or fall,
and riseth in the edge of Brecknoch shire, or (as Leland saith) high
Winceland, from two heads of which one is called Eberith Vehan, the
other Eberith Mawr, as I haue beene informed. The course of the first
head is by Blamgrent, and after the confluence they passe togither by
Lanhileth, and comming by west of Tomberlow hill (crossing a rill, from
<span class="leftnote">Serowie.</span>
north east by the waie) it taketh in thereabout the Serowie, that
runneth by Trestrent, &amp; is of lesse race hitherto than the Ebowith, and
from that same quarter. After this confluence it goeth to Risleie,
Rocheston castell, next of all thorough a parke, and so by Greenefield
castell, and is not long yer it fall into the sea, being the last issue
that I doo find in the countie,
<span class="page"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[Page 128]</span>
which beareth the name of Monemouth, and was in old time a part of the
region of the Silures.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Romeneie.</span>
The Romenie or (as some corruptlie call it) the Nonneie, is a goodlie
water, and from the head a march betwéene <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Monemouch'">Monemouth</ins> &amp; Glamorgan shires.
The head hereof is aboue Egglins Tider vap Hoell otherwise called Fanum
Theodori, or the church of Theodorus, whence commeth manie springs, &amp;
taking one bottome, the water is called Canoch and not Romeneie till it
be come to Romeneie. It receiueth no water on the east side, but on the
west diuerse small beckes, whereof three (and one of them called Ifra)
are betwéene the rising and Brathetere chappell, the fourth c&#333;meth in
by Capell Gledis, and Kethligaire, the fift from betwéene the Faldraie
and Lanuabor, the sixt &amp; seuenth before it come to Bedwas, and the eight
ouer against Bedwas it selfe from chappell Martin, Cairfillie castell,
and Thauan, after which confluences it runneth on by Maghan, Keuen,
Mableie and Romeneie, &amp; yer long crossing a becke at north west that
commeth from aboue Lisuan, Lamssen and Roch, it falleth into the sea,
about six miles from the Wisbe, and albeit the mouth therof be nothing
profitable for ships, yet is it also a march betwéene the Silures and
Glamorganshire.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Laie.</span>
The Laie falleth into the sea a mile almost from the Taffe, and riseth
in the hilles aboue Lantrissent (for all the region is verie hillie.)
From whence comming by Lantrissent and Auercastell, it runneth by Coit
Marchan parke, Lambedder, S. Brides, Lhannihangle, saint Fagans and
Elaie, Leckwith, Landowgh, Cogampill, and so into the sea, without anie
<span class="leftnote">Dunelais.</span>
maner increase by anie rils at all sauing the Dunelais, which riseth
foure miles from his fall, east northeast, and meeteth withall a little
more than a quarter of a mile from Pont Velim Vaur, and likewise by west,
<span class="leftnote">Methcoid.</span>
the Methcoid that commeth from Glinne Rodeneie, and wherein to the
<span class="rightnote">Pedware.</span>
Pedware dischargeth that small water gathered in his chanell. Here will
I staie a little and breake off into a discourse, which Leland left also
as parcell of this coast who toucheth it after this maner.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Laie.</span>
From Taffe to Laie mouth or Ele riuer a mile, from Laie mouth (or rather
<span class="rightnote">Thawan.</span>
Penarth, that standeth on the west point of it) to the mouth of Thawan
riuer (from whence is a common passage ouer vnto Mineheued in
Summersetshire of 17 miles) are about seuen Welsh miles, which are
<span class="leftnote">Scilleie.</span>
counted after this maner. A mile and a halfe aboue Thawan is Scilleie
hauenet (a pretie succour for ships) whose head is in Wenno paroch two
<span class="leftnote">Barrie.</span>
miles and a halfe from the shore. From Scilleie mouth to Aber Barrie a
mile, and thither commeth a little rill of fresh water into Sauerne,
whose head is scant a mile off in plaine ground by northeast, and right
<span class="rightnote">This Ile went fiftie yeares agone for x. pounds.</span>
against the fall of this becke lieth Barrie Iland a flight shot from the
shore at the full sea. Halfe a mile aboue Aber Barrie is the mouth of
<span class="leftnote">Come kidie.</span>
Come kidie, which riseth flat north from the place where it goeth into
the Sauerne, and serueth oft for harbour vnto sea-farers. Thence to the
mouth of Thawan are thrée miles, wherevnto ships may come at will.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Colhow.</span>
Two miles aboue Thawan is Colhow, whither a little rill resorteth from
Lau Iltuit, thence to the mouth of Alen foure miles, that is a mile to
<span class="rightnote"><br />Alen.</span>
saint Dinothes castell, and thrée miles further. The Alen riseth by
northeast vp into the land at a place called Lhes Broimith, or Skirpton,
about foure miles aboue the plot where it commeth by it selfe into
<span class="leftnote">Ogur.</span>
Sauerne. From thence to the mouth of Ogur aliàs Gur thrée miles. Then
<span class="rightnote"><br />Kensike.<br />
Auon.</span>
come they in processe of time vnto the Kensike or Colbrooke riuer, which
is no great thing, sith it riseth not aboue three miles from the shore.
From Kensike to Aber Auon two miles, and herein doo ships molested with
weather oftentimes séeke harborough. It commeth of two armes, wherof
that which lieth northeast is called Auon Vaur, the other that lieth
northwest Auon Vehan. They meet togither at Lhanuoie Hengle, about two
miles aboue Aber Auon village, which is two miles also from the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Neth.</span>
From hence to the Neth is about two miles and a halfe, thereon come
shiplets almost to the towne of Neth from the Sauerne. From the mouth of
Neth vnto the mouth of Crimline becke is two miles, and being passed the
<span class="leftnote">Tauie.</span>
same we come vnto the Tauie, which descendeth from the aforesaid hilles
and falleth into the sea by east of Swanseie. Being past this we come
<span class="rightnote">Lochar.</span>
vnto the Lichwr, or Lochar mouth, and then gliding by the Wormes head,
<span class="page"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[Page 129]</span>
<span class="leftnote"><br />Wandres.</span>
we passed to the Wandresmouth, wherof I find this description following
<span class="rightnote">Vendraith Vaur, Vendraith Vehan.</span>
in Leland. Both Vendraith Vaur and Vendraith Vehan rise in a péece of
Carmardineshire, called Issekenen, that is to saie, the low quarter
about Kennen riuer, and betwixt the heads of these two hils is another
hill, wherein be stones of a gréenish colour, whereof the inhabitants
make their lime. The name of the hill that Vendraith Vaur riseth in, is
called Mennith Vaur, and therein is a poole as in a moorish ground,
named Lhintegowen, where the principall spring is, and this hill is
eight or nine miles from Kidwellie: the hill that Vendraith Vehan
springeth out of, is called Mennith Vehan, and this water commeth by
Kidwellie towne.</p>

<p>But about thrée or foure miles yer it come thither, it receiueth a
brooke called Tresgirth, the course whereof is little aboue a mile from
the place where it goeth into Vendraith, and yet it hath foure or fiue
tucking milles and thrée corne milles vpon it. At the head of this
brooke is an hole in the hilles side, where men often enter and walke in
a large space. And as for the brooke it selfe, it is one of the most
plentifull and commodious that is to be found in Wales. All along the
sides also of Vendraith Vaur, you shall find great plentie of sea-coles.
There is a great hole by head of Vendraith Vehan, where men vse to enter
into vaults of great compasse, and it is said, that they maie go one
waie vnder the ground to Wormes head, and another waie to Cairkemen
castell, which is three miles or more into the land. But how true these
things are, it is not in me to determine; yet this is certeine, that
there is verie good hawking at the Heron in Vendraith Vehan. There are
diuerse prints of the passage of certeine worms also in the caue, at the
head of Vendraith Vehan, as the inhabitants doo fable: but I neuer heard
of anie man that saw anie worme there, and yet it is beléeued that manie
wormes are there. Hitherto out of Leland. But now to returne to mine
owne course.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Laie.</span>
Leauing the Laie, which some call Elaie, and passing the Pennarth baie,
that lieth betwéene the Pennarth and the Lauerocke points, we left
Scillie Ilet (which lieth on the mouth of Scillie hauen before
<span class="leftnote">Barrie.</span>
described) and came vnto the Barrie, whose head is aboue Wrinston
castell, and from whence he runneth by Deinspowis, Cadoxton, Barrie, and
so into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Aberthaw.</span>
Being past the Barrie water, we come to a fall called Aberthaw, which
riseth two or thrée miles aboue Lansanor, and going by Welch Newton, it
commeth at length to Cowbridge, and from thence goeth to Lanblethian,
Landoch, Beanpéere, Flimston, Gilston, and betweene the east and the
west Aberthaw, &amp; into the Sauerne sea. But yer it come all there it
receiueth a brooke called Kensan, or Karnsan, or Kensech, on the east
side, whose head is east of Bolston, &amp; comming by Charnelhoid,
Lhancaruan, &amp; Lancadle, it falleth into the former aboue either of the
<span class="leftnote">Kensan.</span>
Thawans. Leland saith, that Kensan hath two heads, whereof the more
northerlie called Brane, lieth in Luenlithan, and runneth seauen miles
before it méet with the other. Leauing this water we sailed on, casting
about the Nash point, omitting two or thrée small waters (whereof Leland
hath alreadie as ye see made mention) because I haue nothing more to add
vnto their descriptions, except it be, that the Colhow taketh in a rill
from Lan Iltruit, of whose course (to saie the truth) I haue no manner
of knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Ogur.</span>
The Ogur or Gur, which some call the Ogmur, is a well faire streame (as
we were woont to saie in our old English) whose head is in the same
hilles, where the Rodeneies are to be found, but much more westerlie,
and running a long course yer it come to anie village, it goeth at the
length beneath Languineuere or Langouodoch, to S. Brides vpon Ogur, then
<span class="leftnote">Wennie.</span>
to Newcastell, and Marthermaure, beneath which it méeteth the Wennie,
halfe a mile from Ogur or Ogmur castell on the east side of the banke.
It riseth fiue or six miles from this place, among the hilles, and
comming downe at last by Lanharne, it crosseth a rill yer long from
northeast, and the confluence passeth foorth by Coitchurch, Ogur
castell, &amp; so into the Ogur. Leland writing of the waters that fall into
<span class="leftnote">Garrow.</span>
this Ogur saith thus. Into the Ogur also resorteth the Garrow two miles
aboue Lansanfride bridge, descending from Blaingarow. It taketh
<span class="rightnote"><br />Leuennie.<br />
Corug.</span>
furthermore (saith he) another called Leuennie rising in the parish of
<span class="page"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[Page 130]</span>
Glin Corug, at northwest, and then running two miles lower, vniteth it
selfe with the Corug brooke, a little short thing, and worthie no longer
speach. From this confluence the Leuennie goeth seauen miles further yer
it meete with the Ogur on the west side, at Lansanfride, two miles aboue
Penbowt. And so far Leland. But I wot not what he meaneth by it.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Kensig.</span>
Next vnto the Ogur is the Kensig water, that commeth downe by the Pile
<span class="rightnote">Margan.</span>
and Kensig castell, and being past the same we crosse the Margan rill,
<span class="leftnote"><br />Auon.</span>
where sir Edward Manxell dwelt, and so vnto Auon, which hauing two heads
(as is said) the more easterlie of them commeth downe by Hauodaport
chappell, the other by Glin Corug, Michaell church, Aber Auon, and so
into the sea, yéelding also in time of néed a good harbour for ships to
lodge and ride in. From hence we went along by the Cole pits to the
<span class="leftnote">Neth.<br />
Nethuehan.</span>
mouth of the Neth. The Neth is a faire water, rising of diuerse heads,
whereof the more easterlie named Nethuehan riseth not farre from the
head of the Kennon, and comming downe by Penedorin to Aberpirgwin it
<span class="rightnote">Nethuaur.</span>
receiueth Nethuaur, a little aboue the towne, which rising not farre
southeast of the head of Tauie in Brecknoch shire (as all the rest doo)
<span class="leftnote">Trangarth.<br />
Meltaie.<br />
Hepsaie.</span>
receiueth the Trangarth, the Meltaie and the Hepsaie, all which are
accounted as members of his head in one chanell, about a mile or more
before it ioine with Nethuehan. For as Trangarth riseth east of
Nethuaur, so the Melta riseth by east of Trangarth, and ioineth with the
same aboue Istrad wealthie, and a little beneath the same towne taketh
in the Hepsaie. So that albeit their seuerall risings be half or a whole
mile in sunder, yet haue they (in a maner) like distance from
Aberpirgwin, and their finall confluence in the edge of Glamorganshire,
which they directlie doo crosse. After these confluences, the maine
streame runneth in and out by sundrie miles, and through the wooddie
soiles, till it meet with Cledaugh, which ioineth with the same beneath
the Resonlaie, and goeth withall to Lanisted, where it taketh in the
<span class="leftnote">Dulesse.</span>
Dulesse, whose head is aboue Chappell Krenaunt, in the marches of
Brecknoch. Thence it goeth to Cador towne, or betwéene it and
Lannistide, then to Neth towne, whither small vessels often come: and
<span class="leftnote">Cledoch.</span>
beneath the same receiuing the Cledoch that runneth by Kelebebilch (and
also Neth abbeie where maister Crumwell dwelleth) it goeth on by
Coitfranke forrest, Nethwood, Briton ferrie, and so into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Tauie.</span>
The Tauie riseth in the thickest of the blacke mounteines in
Brecknochshire west of Nethnaur, and comming downe west of Calwen
<span class="leftnote"><br />Coilus.</span>
chappell, it receiueth on the east banke a rill named Coiell that
runneth thither by Coielburne chappell: and being thus vnited, the
<span class="leftnote"><br />Torch.</span>
chanell passeth foorth by Istradgunles, and then méeting with the Turch
or Torch water that c&#333;meth from the foot of the blacke mounteines,
and is march to parcell of Caermardinshire, it runneth to Langoge,
Lansamled, saint Iohns, Swanseie, and so into the Baie. Being past this,
we come by another little fall, whose water runneth thrée or foure miles
yer it come into Swanseie baie, but without name. Thence we go to the
Crimline becke, whose description I neither haue, nor find anie great
want therof. Wherfore going about by Oistermont castell, and Mumbles
point, we passe foorth toward the southwest, by Penmarch point, til we
<span class="leftnote">Ilston.</span>
come to Ilston water, whose head is not farre within the land; and yet
as it commeth thorough the woodland, and downe by Penmarch castell, a
rill or two dooth fall into the same. Then casting about by Oxwich
point, we go onward there by, and sailing flat north by the Holme
(hauing passed the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Wormeslead'">Wormeshead</ins> and S. Kennets chappell) and then
<span class="leftnote">Lochar.</span>
northeast by Whitford point, we went at length to the Lochar or Loghor,
or as Lhoyd nameth it, the Lichwr, whose indraught for a certene space
is march betwéene Caermardine and Glamorgan shires. It riseth aboue
Gwenwie chappell, from whence it goeth Landbea, to and aboue Bettus
<span class="leftnote">Amond.</span>
receiueth a rill named Amond that entreth thereinto from northeast.
Being past Bettus, it passeth by Laneddie, Arthelas bridge and ouer
<span class="rightnote">Combwilie.</span>
against Landilo Talabout, it crosseth from by west, the Combwilie by
<span class="leftnote">Morlais.</span>
west of Parkreame, and afterward the Morlais aboue Langnarch on the same
side. Then comming to Loghor castell, it taketh in on the east side, the
<span class="leftnote">Lhu.</span>
Lhu, whose course is not aboue fiue miles, and thence loosing the name
<span class="rightnote">Burraie.</span>
of Lochar, it is called Burraie, as some gesse, vntill it come to the
sea, where it parteth it selfe going on each side (of Bachannie Iland, a
<span class="page"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[Page 131]</span>
small thing) and not worthie for anie thing I read thereof, as yet to be
particularlie described. From this water we passed (I saie) by
Bachannies Ile, to the Aberlheddie water, whose head being in the hilles
aboue Prenacrois, it passeth by Lhaneltheie, and thence into the sea.
<span class="leftnote">Dulesse.</span>
Then went we to the Dulesse a little rill, whose head is not farre from
Trinsaren: thence by the Pembraie and Calicoit points, till we came
<span class="leftnote">Wandres.</span>
about to the Wandres or Vendraith mouth, whose description is partlie
touched alreadie; but bicause it is not such as I would wish it to be, I
will here after my owne maner deale somewhat further withall. Gwendrath
or Vendraith vaur riseth in the lower ground, or not far from the hill
Renneth Vaur, whereon castell Careg standeth, and descending by a pretie
long course vnder sundrie bridges, commeth at the last to Glin, then to
Capull Lanberie, and so vnto the sea, being little augmented with
influences by the waie. Vendraith Vehan riseth a mile higher towards the
north than Vendraith Vaur, but out of the same soile, &amp; thence directing
his course toward the southwest, it goeth by Lancharog, Langendarne,
Capull Langell, Bithon, Leighdenie, Kidwillie, and so into the sea,
about one mile from the fall of Vendraith Vaur.</p>
<p>
The Towie riseth in the mounteines of Elennith<span class="leftnote">Towie.</span>
foure miles by southeast
from Lintiue, and two from Lingonon, in a moorish ground foure &amp; twentie
miles from Caermardine, and in a forrest called Bishops forrest, midwaie
betwixt Landwibreuie &amp; Landanuerie castell. For fish, in my opinion,
this is much better than the Taw or Taffe, whose head breedeth no fish,
but if it be cast into it, they turne vp their bellies flote aloft and
die out of hand. It parteth Brecknoch from Cardigonshire also for a
<span class="leftnote">Trausnant.</span>
certeine season, till it come by the water of Trausnant, that falleth
thereinto from by east out of the confins of Brecknoch, vnto Pilin
<span class="rightnote">Tothée.</span>
capell, and so to Istrodefine, where it méeteth with the Tothee that
commeth thither from Lhinuerwin where it riseth, and so through Rescoth
<span class="leftnote">Pescotter.</span>
forrest, vniting it selfe by the waie with the Pescotter, which mounting
out of the ground in the edge of Cardigonshire, runneth along as a limit
and march vnto the same, till it ioine with the Tothée, and both come
togither beneath Istrodefine into Towie, which we haue now in hand.
After this confluence it commeth to Lhanuair Awbreie, Lanihowell, and
Lanimphfrie, and here it receiueth two waters in one chanell, whereof
<span class="leftnote"><br />Brane.<br />
Gutherijc.</span>
the first is called Brane, the other Gutherijc (which lieth more
southerlie of the two) and fall (as I said) into Towie beneath
<span class="rightnote"><br />Dulesse.<br />
Morlais.</span>
Landonuereie, which runneth on till it méet with the first Dulesse that
goeth by Lenurdie, then with the Morlais, and these on the northwest.
Certes the Brane is a pretie brooke rising two or thrée miles aboue
Capell Newith, and descending by Lanbrane and Vstradwalter, it méeteth
(I saie) with the Gutherijc, whose head is west of Tridcastell in
Brecknochshire, and thereby it is not a little increased. But to proceed
with the Towie, which being past Lanimphfrie and a rill that méeteth
with the same, descending from northwest of Lanurdan, it taketh in the
influences of diuerse waters in one chanell, of which the greatest is
called Modewie, and thereof I find this description.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Modewie.</span>
The Modewie, or (as some pronounce it) Motheuie, riseth of two heads,
which ioining aboue Lanihangle, the streame runneth on till it méet with
<span class="leftnote"><br />Cledoch.</span>
the Cledoch on the left hand, procéeding also further toward Langadocke,
<span class="rightnote">Sawtheie.</span>
it receiueth not far from thence the Sawtheie, whose two heads descend
from the blacke mounteines or east edge of Carmardineshire (as mine
<span class="rightnote">Dulesse. 2.</span>
information leadeth me.) After this confluence the second Dulesse dooth
méet with the Towie, whose head is in the hilles aboue Talthogaie
abbeie, northwest from Langadocke full fiue miles: then comming downe by
Landilovaur, Newton, Dinefar castell, and Golden groue, it receiueth the
<span class="leftnote">Dulesse. 3.</span>
third Dulesse from by north that commeth in by Lanihangle and Drislan
<span class="leftnote"><br />Cothie.</span>
castell, and after that the Cothie, whose race is somewhat long, and
therefore his description not vtterlie to be passed ouer.</p>

<p>Not farre from the head (which is three miles from Landanbreuie, vnder
the hulke of Blame Icorne, a narrow passage, and therein manie heaps of
stones) and somewhat beneath Lana Pinsent chappell, it taketh in the
<span class="leftnote">Turche.</span>
Turche becke that runneth thither from aboue Lanacroies: thence it goeth
to Lansawell, Abergorlech, Breghuangothie, Lannigood, and so into Towie,
<span class="rightnote">Rauelthie.</span>
which hasting forward by chappell Dewie, receiueth the Rauelthie from by
<span class="page"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[Page 132]</span>
<span class="rightnote"><br />Gwilie.</span>
north, then the Gwilie from northwest, whose head is aboue Lanie
Pinsent, and race by Canwell, Eluert, Comewilie, and Merling hill as I
haue often heard. After this confluence with the Gwilie, the Towie goeth
to Caermardine, then to Lanigang, then to Lanstephan, S. Ismaels, and so
into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Taue.</span>
Next vnto the Towie is the Taue, whose head is in the blacke mounteines,
as at the roots of Wrenni vaur hill in Pembrookeshire, from whence it
<span class="leftnote"><br />Dudderie.</span>
runneth by Lanuurnach, Langludien, Lanualteg, and taking in the Dudderie
from southwest, out of the same countie by Lanbederuelfraie, and Lindwie,
<span class="rightnote">Marlais.</span>
it goeth to Eglesware chappell, beneath which it crosseth the Marlais by
north that runneth by Lanbedie and Whitland. Thence meeting with one
<span class="leftnote">Vennie.</span>
rill called Venni, as I take it, that commeth through Cardith forrest on
<span class="rightnote">Caire.</span>
the one side, and the Caire on the other that runneth into it west of
<span class="leftnote"><br />Carthkinnie.</span>
Landowror, it hasteth to S. Clares, where it taketh in the Carthkinnie,
<span class="rightnote">Gow.</span>
or Barthkinnie (as Leland calleth it) and the Gow or Tow both in one
chanell, of which the first riseth aboue Capell Bettus, from whence it
runneth by Talacouthe, Kilsant, and Langinnin, the other issueth out of
the ground aboue Trologh Bettus, by Midrun, &amp; ioining with the former a
little aboue S. Clares, they run into the Taue, and from thence to
<span class="leftnote"><br />Gowen.</span>
Lanihangle, and betwéene it and Abercowen, admitteth finallie the Gowen
or Gow streame, which comming likewise from the blacke mounteines, goeth
by Ebbernant, &amp; so into the Taue, who directeth his course by Lancharne
castell, and then into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Gwair.</span>
The next water that we come to is the Gwair, which is but a small thing
rising aboue Lambeder Velfraie, and going from thence by east of castell
Merhie hill, Crumuier and Argwaire, it is not long yer it fall into the
sea, and so we leaue Cairdinshire, and go ouer into Penbrooke. Then
passed we by an other comming out of Rathe forrest called Coit Rathe,
the water it selfe rising about Templeton. Thence leauing the Monkeston
rocke, we came to Tenbie or Dinbechie Piscood, and passing into the port
<span class="leftnote">Brechnocke.</span>
betwéene the castell and S. Katharines rocke, we found it serued with
two little backe waters, of so small countenance, that they are not
worthie of anie further talke to be spent in their descriptions: yet the
one séemeth to be called Florence brooke, the other Fresto, Gunfreston
standing betwéene them both, when by their sight cannot perish. After
<span class="rightnote">From Londie to Caldie thirtie miles.</span>
this we passed betwéene Londie and an other Ilet or rocke lieng by
northwest of the same, to Ludsop point, &amp; so to Abertrewent, where I
<span class="leftnote">Trewent.</span>
found a sillie fresh water named Trewend that riseth a mile or
thereabout within the land. From thence we went southwards by Brode
hauen, till we came to S. Gowans point. Then gathering west and by north
before we came at Shepe Iland, we found another fresh water, that riseth
short of Kiriog Maharen, and running south of Vggarston, Windmill hill,
or betwéene it and Castell Norton and Gupton, it holdeth on flat west
all the waie till it come to the Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Pennar.</span>
Being passed this water, we cast about toward the northwest, by the
Poptons and Pennar, till we came to the Pennar mouth, out of which the
salt water issueth that in manor inuironneth Penbroke. From this
(omitting sundrie salt créekes on both sides of the hauen, not
appertinent to our purpose) we came to the fall of two waters in one
chanell, aboue whose confluence Williamston parke standeth, and whereof
one (a méere salt course) incloseth thrée parts of Carew castell. The
other rising néere to Coit Rath forrest is a fresh, &amp; going by
Geffraiston, Creswell &amp; Lawrenie, it leaueth the parke on the south
side, &amp; goeth into the hauen after confluence with the former.</p>

<p>Now come I to the two swords, or hauen of Milford, whereinto two riuers
<span class="leftnote">Dugledu.</span>
direct their course from the northeast called Dugledu or the two swords,
<span class="leftnote"><br />Cultlell.</span>
and betwéene them both is a rill which they call also Cultlell (that is
to saie) the knife. Hereof riseth a merrie tale of a Welshman, that
lieng in this place abroad all night in the cold weather, and
peraduenture not verie well occupied, was demanded of his hostesse
(where he did breake his fast the next morrow) at what inne he laie in
the night precedent, bicause he came so soone to hir house yer anie of
hir maids were vp? Oh good hostesse (quoth he) be contented, I laie to
night in a dangerous estate, for I slept betweene two swords with a long
knife at my heart; meaning indéed that he laie betwéene these two
riuers, and his brest towards the south neere to the head of Cultlell.
<span class="page"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[Page 133]</span>
<span class="leftnote"><br />Gwilie.</span>
But to passe ouer these iests. Here Leland speaketh of a riuer called
Gwilie, but where it riseth or falleth, he maketh no certeine report:
wherefore it is requisit that I proceed according to my purpose.</p>
<p>
The one of these swords is called Clotheie or Clothie, of which I find
<span class="leftnote">Clotheie.</span>
this short and breefe description. The Clothie riseth at the foot of
Wrennie vaure hill and comming downe to Monachlodge, Langelman,
Lannakeuen, and Egremond, it receiueth a rill from by northwest before
it come at Lanhaddon castell, which commeth from aboue the moore by
Clarbaston and Bletherston, his head arising in the hill west of
Mancloghaie, as Leland dooth informe me. Yer long also and beneath
Lanhaddon it taketh in another on the east side from Narbarth castell,
comming by Robeston, then going by Cunaston, Slebach, Picton castell,
Sister houses, Minware &amp; Martheltwie, at Rise castell point west of Coit
<span class="leftnote">Dugledie.</span>
Kenles (as I haue béene informed) it taketh in the other sword, named
Dugledie, wherof I read as followeth. The head of the Dugledie is
somwhere at northwest, betwixt S. Laurences &amp; S. Dugwels, from whence it
runneth to Trauegarne, Redbaxton, &amp; taking in a rill by the waie from
Camrose at the west, it goeth to Hauerford or Hereford west, and there
vniteth it selfe with a water, which peraduenture is the same that
<span class="leftnote">Gwilie.</span>
Leland called Gwilie. Certes it riseth short of Walton, and comming by
S. Leonards chappell and Pendergest, it falleth I saie into the
Dugledie, ouer against the towne of Hauerford or Herford west, but in
Welsh Hufford; as Lhoid dooth set it downe. Beneath Herford it taketh in
another water from south west, whose head is short of S. Margarets
chappell, and enterance betweene Harraldston and Herford, which
Harraldstone receiueth the name of Harrald the successour of Edward the
confessour as some call him, who was a gréeuous mall vnto the Britons
that remained in the time of the said Edward; as I haue noted elsewhere.
Then the Dugledie still descending taketh in the Frese fr&#333;
Fresethorpe, a rill of no great accompt, and therefore I go from it
making hast vnto Culthell, &amp; omitting two rils betwéene it and the
Clotheie on the southside, of no great weight and moment. The Cultlhell
commeth into the Dugledie beneath Bolston, with a streight course from
by north, of three or foure miles, rising by west of Slebach, and
comming by Bowlston, after whose vnition with the aforesaid water they
run on as one till they méet with the Clothie, casting out by the waie
sundrie salt créekes, as the maine chanell dooth from thence foorth
vntill it passe the Sandie hauen, the Dale rode (whither a sillie fresh
rill commeth of small value) &amp; be come about againe to the large Ocean.</p>

<p>Having thus shewed the courses of those few fresh waters that come to
Milford hauen, we cast about by the Blockehouse and S. Annes chappell
<span class="leftnote">Gateholme Ile.</span>
to Gateholme Ile, that lieth betwéene S. Annes and the Wilocke point,
<span class="rightnote">Stockholme Ile.</span>
directlie ouer against Stockeholme Iland that is situat further off into
the sea, toward the southwest, and is full halfe so great as the
Scalmeie that I elsewhere described. Betweene the Willocke point also
<span class="leftnote">Midland Ile.</span>
and the Scalmeie, directlie west is the Midland Ile, full so great as
the Gateholme. As for the two rocks that lie by north and south of the
Scalmeie, of which the one is called the Yardland stone, the other
Mewstone, it shall not be greatlie requisit to stand on their
discourses, sith they are such as may hardlie be taken for Ilands, and
euen in like sort we may iudge of S. Brides Ile, which is southwest of
<span class="leftnote">Gresholme.</span>
Calthrop rode, &amp; likewise of the Gresholme, whereof I find this short
description. The Gresholme lieth directlie west of Scalmeie, from whence
if you saile thither on the south side, you must néeds passe by the
Mewstone rocke: if on the north of Scalmeie, you must leaue the Yarland
stone on your left hand. Wherto if you note well the situation of these
Ilands alreadie named, and confer them with the Ramseie and S. Dauids
land, you shall find them to produce as it were two dangerous points,
including the Bridbaie, wherein (notwithstanding the greatnesse) are
1000 perils, and no fresh brookes for me to deale withall. Finallie,
hauing doubled the Willocke point, we thought it not good altogether to
leaue that baie vnsearched, at lestwise to sée what Ilands might there
be found, &amp; long entred into the same, we beheld one which the men of
<span class="rightnote">S. Brides Iland.</span>
the countrie call S. Brides Iland, a verie little place and situate
néere the land, before I came at Galtroie rode. From thence we went
<span class="page"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[Page 134]</span>
about by the little hauen, Doluach hauen, Caruaie hauen, Shirelace
rocke, Carnbuddie, and Carnaie baies, Portelais, and so into the sound
betwéene Ramseie and the point. In this sound likewise is a little Ile,
almost annexed to the maine: but in the middest thereof, I meane of the
sound, is a rocke called the horsse (a mile and more by north of Ribbie
rocke, that lieth south east of Ramseie) and more infortunate than ten
<span class="rightnote">A sort of dangerous rocks lieng on a row upon the
west end of South-wales called the Bishop &amp; his clerkes.</span>
of Seians colts, but thanked be God I neuer came on his backe. Thence
passing by S. Stephans, and Whitesand baies, we saluted the Bishop and
his clerks, as they went on procession on our left side (being loth to
take anie salted holie water at their hands) and came at last to the
point called S. Dauids head, which Ptolomie calleth Octapitanum
promontorium, except I be deceiued. But here gentle reader giue me leaue
to staie a while, and insert the words of Leland touching the land
called S. Dewies or S. Dauids land, whereof some men may peraduenture
haue vse, his words are these. Being therefore past this hauen and point
<span class="leftnote">S. Dewie or Dauid all one.</span>
of Demetia, in casting about the coast we come to S. Dewies or S. Dauids
land, which Ptolomie calleth Octapitanum promontorium, I read to be
separated from the rest of the countrie much after this maner, although
I grant that there may be and are diuerse other little creekes betwixt
Newgale and S. Dauids head, and betwixt S. Dauids and Fischard, beside
those that are héere mentioned out of a register of that house.</p>

<p>As we turne therefore from Milford, S. Dauids land beginneth at Newgale,
a créeke serued with a backe fresh water. Howbeit there is a baie before
this creeke betwixt it and Milford. From hence about foure miles is
<span class="leftnote">Saluach.</span>
Saluach creeke, otherwise called Sauerach, whither some fresh water
resorteth: the mouth also thereof is a good rescue for balingers, as it
<span class="rightnote">Portelais.</span>
(I meane the register) saith. Thence go we to Portelais three miles,
<span class="leftnote">Alen.</span>
where is a little portlet, whither the Alen that commeth through saint
Dewies close dooth run. It lieth a mile south-west from S. Dewies,
<span class="leftnote">Portmaw.</span>
saint Stinans Chappell also is betwéene Portelais, and Portmaw. The next
<span class="leftnote"><br />Maw.<br />
Pendwie.<br />
Lanuehan.</span>
is Port Maw, where I found a great estuarie into the land. The Pendwie
halfe a mile from that: Lhand Vehan is thrée miles from Pendwie, where
<span class="rightnote">Tredine.</span>
is a salt créeke, then to Tredine three miles, where is another creeke
<span class="rightnote"><br />Langunda.</span>
to Langunda, foure miles, and another créeke is there in like sort where
fishermen catch herrings. Héere also the Gwerne riuer diuideth
<span class="rightnote"><br />Fischard.<br />
Gwerne.</span>
Penbidiane from Fischerdine Kemmeis land. From Langunda to Fischard at
the Gwerne mouth foure miles, and here is a portlet or hauenet also for
ships. And thus much of S. Dauids land.</p>

<p>Besides this also, Leland in a third booke talketh of lhinnes and
pooles, but for as much as my purpose is not to speake of lakes and
lhinnes, I passe them ouer as hasting to Teifie, in Latine Tibius, and
after Ptolomie Tuerobius or Tiuirobius, which is the next riuer that
serueth for my purpose. And yet not forgetting to touch the Gwerne, for
after we came from saint Dauids head, we coasted along toward the
southeast, till wée came ouer against saint Catharins, where going
northwards by the broad hauen, and the Strombles head, we sailed thence
northeast, and by north, to Langlas head, then flat south by the Cow and
Calfe (two cruell rockes) which we left on the left hand, &amp; so coasted
ouer to Abergwin or Fischard where we found a fresh water named Guin, or
<span class="leftnote">Gwerne.</span>
Gwerne, whose course is in manner directlie out of the east into the
west, from Vremie hils by pont Vaunt and Lanichair, vntill it come
within a mile of the foresaid towne. It riseth flat north of the
Perselie hill, from whence it goeth by Pont vaine, Lauerillidoch,
Lanchar, Landilouair, &amp; so to Abergwine, or Abergwerne, for I read both.
<span class="leftnote">Neuerne.</span>
From Abergwine, we cast about by Dinas head, till we come to the fall of
Neuerne, where Newport standeth. The head of this riuer is aboue Capell
Nantgwin, from whence it runneth by Whitchurch, but yer it come at
Kilgwin, it taketh in a little water that riseth short of Wrenie vaure,
and thence go foorth as one vntill they come to Newport. Cardigan hauen
is the next fall that I did stumble on, wherein lieth a little Iland
<span class="leftnote">Teifie or Tine.</span>
ouer against the north point. Hereinto also commeth the Teifie, a noble
riuer which riseth in Lintiuie, and is fraught with delicate samons, and
herein and not else where in all the riuers of Britaine, is the Castor
or Beuer to be found. But to procéed. The verie hed thereof (I saie) is
foure miles aboue Stradflore in Luitie, and after it hath run from
thence a little space, it receiueth a brooke from southeast that commeth
<span class="page"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[Page 135]</span>
out of Lin Legnant, and then after the confluence runneth on to
<span class="rightnote">Miricke.</span>
Stradflore abbeie, beneth which it méeteth with the Miricke water (that
<span class="leftnote"><br />Landurch.</span>
riseth aboue Stradmirich) and soone after with the Landurch (both from
the northwest) and finallie the Bremich aboue Tregaron, that commeth in
by the east; as Leland hath set downe.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bromis.</span>
Néere to Landwibreuie also it crosseth the Bromis by east northeast, and
<span class="leftnote"><br />Matherne.</span>
then goeth to Landuair, Cledogh, Kellan, and soone after taking in the
Matherne from by east, that parteth Cardigan partlie from Carmardine
<span class="rightnote">Dulas.</span>
shire, and likewise that Dulas aboue Lanbedder (which riseth aboue
Langibbie, and goeth thence to Bettus) on the northwest, it goeth next
of all to Lanbedder towne, then to Laniuair, beneath which it crosseth
<span class="leftnote">Grauelth.</span>
the Grauelth, thence to Pencarocke, Lanibether, Lanlonie, Lanihangle,
<span class="rightnote">Clethor.</span>
and Sandissell, and there it vniteth it selfe with the Clethor or
Dettor, which commeth downe thither by Lantisilued chappell, Lanfraine,
and finallie Landissell from by north, as I doo here affirme. After this
confluence it procéedeth on to Landuaie, Alloine, Bangor, Langeler,
<span class="leftnote">Kerie.</span>
Landeureog and Newcastell, yer long taking in the Kerie from by north,
whose head is not farre from that of Clethor, and whose course is
somewhat inlarged by such rilles as descend into the same. For west of
Kenwith two becks in one chanell doo fall into it, which be namelesse,
and but of a little length.</p>

<p>Beneath Tredwair also it crosseth another from by west, that runneth
along by Bettus, Euan, and finallie méeting with the Teifie, they run as
one by Kennarth (still parting Cardigon shire from Carmardin, as it hath
doone sith it met with the Matherne) and so forth on till they ioine
<span class="leftnote">Cheach.</span>
with the Cheach, which rising southeast aboue chappell Euan, dooth part
Carmardine and Brechnocke shire in sunder, till it come vnto the Teifie.
From this confluence, and being still a limit vnto Cardigon shire, it
goeth by Marierdine, and so to Cardigon, taking in one rill from by
north descending by Penneralt, by north of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Also 'Manerdue'. Now called 'Manordeifi'">Monardiue</ins> or Marierdine, and
two other from by southwest, of which the one commeth in beneath
Kilgaron castell, the other from Lantwood north west of Oscoid Mortemer,
which lieth southeast of Cardigan, and then going forward betwéene S.
Dogmaile, &amp; Langordmere, it is not long yer it fall into the Irish sea,
flat west and by north from his vprise, and sending vs forth from
Penlooke into Cardigon shire, wherevnto it hath become march euer
sithence it came from Kellam, or confluence with the Matherne.</p>

<p>Being come into Cardigon shire, and hauing passed the Cardigon point, an
Iland of the same denomination lieng by west thereof, we came vnto the
<span class="leftnote">Airon.</span>
fall of Airon thrée miles beneath Lancleere, it riseth in the mounteines
by a chappell called Blam Peniall belonging to Landwie breuie about
thrée or foure miles from Tiue banks, &amp; runneth on by Lamberwooddie,
Langitho, Tregrigaron hill, Treuilian, Talaferne, and soone after taking
in a rill from by south from Siliam by Lanleir it runneth by Istrade,
Kilkennen, Lanicharin, and finallie into the sea, crossing by the waie
<span class="leftnote">Bidder.</span>
the Bidder brooke, which comming from Dehewide, dooth fall into the same,
<span class="rightnote">Arth.</span>
betwéene Lanchairin, and Henuenneie. The Arth which is the next fall is
no great thing, neither of anie long course, yet somewhat crotched, and
it riseth three or foure miles or more within the land slopewise, and
comming by Lambaderne, and Treueglois, it falleth into the sea,
northeast of Aberarth.</p>

<p>Being past the Arth, &amp; hauing staied there a while bicause we found some
<span class="leftnote">Ris aliàs Wereie.</span>
harborough, we came next of all vnto the Wereie, which riseth of two
heads, aboue whose confluence standeth a towne, named Lanihangle,
Redrod, and from whence it goeth by Lanigruthen to Laristed, &amp; so into
the Ocean. Then went we to the Ystwith, which riseth in the blacke
mounteins aboue Comerstwith, from whence it runneth certeine miles,
<span class="leftnote">Istwith.</span>
vntill it come vnto Ispittie, Istwith, Lananon, Laniler, Lan Nachairne,
<span class="rightnote">Redholl.</span>
and so into the sea, taking withall first the Meleuen, then the Ridall
or Redholl not farre from the shore, whereof I haue this description.
The Ridall riseth in the top of Plimlimmon hill out of a lake named Lin
Ridall, from whence going toward Spittie Kinwen, it crosseth one water
on the north, and another beneth it on the southeast, and so goeth on by
Lanbeder vaure, till it come to Aberistwith, the Istwith, and so into
the Ocean. Hauing thus viewed the Istwith, and taken our selues againe
<span class="leftnote">Salique.</span>
to the sea, we crossed the Salke or Salique brooke, whereof I find this
memoriall.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[Page 136]</span></p>

<p>The Salique brooke descendeth in like sort from the blacke mounteins, &amp;
going from Vmmaboue, toward Gogarth, or Gogirthar, it receiueth the
Massalique, and from thence goeth into the sea, southwest from his
<span class="leftnote">Massalique.</span>
<span class="rightnote">Lerie.</span>
originall. From hence we went to the Lerie, an indraught of no great
quantitie, neither commodious as I gesse (yet I may be deceiued) for
anie ship to harborough in. It riseth toward the lower ground of the
blacke hils, and going by Lanihangle castell Gwalter, it runneth from
thence northeast into the Ocean, receiuing a rill by the waie from the
hilles which lie by northeast of his course. But what stand I vpon
trifles?</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Wie.</span>
Thus haue I brought my selfe out of Caerdigan shire vnto the Wie, which
is limit betwéene it and Merioneth for a certeine space, &amp; being entred
in the mouth thereof we gat vp to the head, minding in the description
of the same to come downeward as in the rest, which we will doo in such
good manner as for the time and want of some information is possible to
be performed. It ariseth in the south part of Snowdonie and goeth on
foorth right to Lammothwie, by Mowdhewie, Mathan laith, and comming
downe to Dinas Mathew, it receiueth two rilles from northwest, and the
third comming by Mailroid called Cludoch from northeast, &amp; so holdeth on
crossing the Angell water at the west, which boundeth Mongomerie shire
<span class="leftnote">Remis.</span>
in part, till it come to Romis, beneath which water it taketh in the
Towin that passeth by Lambrin mawr from Talgarth, and then goeth to
Mathrauerne, crossing another from by north and so foorth to Lanworing,
where it méeteth with the Kerig on the one side, and the Gwidall which
commeth from Dorowen on the other.</p>

<p>After this, our maine riuer goeth by Pengos, and beneath the same taketh
in an influence from southeast, called the Dulas, and another from the
northwest: from thence it hasteth on to Magenillet, or Machenlet, first
crossing the Leuennie from southeast, secondlie the Peniall from
northwest, thirdlie the Einon, fourthlie the Kinar, fiftlie the Cleidor,
these thrée last rehearsed falling into it from southeast, &amp; the last
hauing his course by Langwinhelin and so into the sea, as mine
instruction vpholdeth. It séemeth in some mens iudgements to part
Northwales and Westwales in sunder, and the same which in Latine hight
Deuus, in Welsh or British Difi or Dewie, whereof the Latine doth séeme
to fetch his sound. But to procéed with the rest of such falles and
waters as are to be found in this countie. Going therfore northwestward
we come to a fall fr&#333; the north called Towen Merionneth which is the
mouth of the Difonnie streame, a pretie riuer rising in the hilles aboue
Lanihangle, and west of castell Traherne receiueth the Ridrijc, which
commeth from Chadridrijc hill, by Tallillin castell, Treherie, and so
into the Difonnie from southeast, fetching his course by Lanegrin, and
so into the sea within fiue miles thereof.</p>

<p>Being past this we did cast about by the Sarnabigh point, till we came
to the Lingouen becke, and so to the Barre, which is a faire water, and
therefore worthie to be with diligence described, yet it is not called
Bar from the head, but rather Moth or Derie, for so are the two chiefe
heads called out of which this riuer descendeth, and are about six miles
west of the Lin, out of which the Dée hath his issue, and betwéene which
the Raran vaure hilles are situat and haue their being. After the
ioining of the two heds of this Barre, as I name it from the originall,
it receiueth a rill from northeast called Cain, &amp; another beneath the
same, comming from Beurose wood, and so holdeth on towards the south
betwéene Laniltid and Kemmor abbaie, till it meet a little by west of
Dolgelth with the Auon vaure, which comming also out of the Woodland
soile, &amp; taking in a rill from Gwannas, hasteth northwestward (by
Dolgelth) to ioine with the Barre, and being met they receiue the
Kessilgunt, then the Hirgun, &amp; after a course of foure to fiue miles it
falleth into the sea, hauing watered the verie hart &amp; inward parts of
this shire. From hence we crosse the Skethie which runneth by Corsogdale
and Lanthwie, aliàs Lanthonie, then the Lambader which receiuing the
Artro aboue Lambader, doth fall into the sea, southeast of the point,
and flat south of Landango, which is a towne situat on the other side of
the turning.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Ho.</span>
After this we passed by Aberho, so named of the riuer Ho, that falleth
there into the sea, and commeth thither from the Alpes or hils of
Snowdonie, mounteins, no lesse fertile for grasse, wood, cattell, fish
<span class="page"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[Page 137]</span>
and foule, than the famous Alpes beyond the seas, whereof all the
writers doo make so honorable report. From hence we sailed by Abermawr
<span class="leftnote">Mawr.</span>
or mouth of Mawr, which commeth in like sort from Snowdonie, and taketh
<span class="leftnote"><br />Artro.</span>
diuerse riuers with him whose names I doo not know. Then vnto the Artro
a brooke, whose head commeth from by north east, and in his course
receiueth the Gedar on the north side, and so holdeth on till it fall
into the sea, after a few windlesses which it maketh as it passeth.
After this we come to Traith vehan, which is the fall of the Drurid, a
pretie riuer comming from the marches of Caernaruonshire, which passing
by Festimog, soone after taketh in the Cunwell, then the Velenrid; and
so holdeth on to Deckoin, where it falleth into the said Traith. For of
the other two rilles that lie by south hereof, and haue their issue also
into the same, I make but small accompt, bicause their quantitie is not
great. Next vnto this we haue Traith mawr,
<span class="leftnote">Farles.</span>
whereinto the Farles hath his issue, a riuer proceeding
from Snowdonie or the Snowdon hils, descending by Bethkelerke and
Lanwrothen, without mixture of anie other water in all his course and
passage. It is parcell of the march also betwéene Merioneth and
Caernaruon shires. From Traith mawr we passe by the Krekith, and come to
another water descending from the north by Lanstidwie, and after that to
the Moie, whose mouthes are so néere togither, that no more than halfe a
mile of the land dooth seeme to kéepe them in sunder.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Erke.</span>
Then come we vnto the Erke, a pretie brooke descending from Madrijn
hils, into whose mouth two other of no lesse quantitie than it selfe doo
séeme to haue their confluence, and whose courses doo come along from
the west and northwest; the most southerlie being called Girch, and the
other the Hellie: except my memorie doo faile me. Then casting about
toward the south (as the coast lieth) we saw the Abersoch or mouth of
<span class="leftnote">Soch.</span>
the Soch riuer vpon our right hand, in the mouth whereof, or not farre
by south thereof lie two Ilands, of which the more northerlie is called
Tudfall, and the other Penrijn: as Leland did obserue. I would set downe
the British names of such townes and villages as these waters passe by;
but the writing of them (for want of the language) is so hard to me,
that I choose rather to shew their falles and risings, than to corrupt
their denominations in the writing: and yet now and then I vse such
words as our Englishmen doo giue vnto some of them, but that is not
often, where the British name is easie to be found out and sounded.</p>

<p>After this, going about by the point, and leauing Gwelin Ile on the
<span class="leftnote">Daron.</span>
right hand, we come to Daron riuer, wherevpon standeth Aberdaron a
quarter of a mile from the shore betwixt Aberdaron and Vortigernes vale,
where the compasse of the sea gathereth in a head, and entereth at both
<span class="leftnote">Edarne beck.</span>
ends. Then come we about the point to Edarne becke, a mile and more
south of Newin. And ten or twelue miles from hence is the Vennie brooke,
whose course is little aboue so manie miles; and not farre from it is
the Liuan, a farre lesse water, comming also from the east: and next
vnto that another, wherinto the Willie by south and the Carrog by north
after their coniunction doo make their common influence. Hauing passed
this riuer, we cast about toward the north east, and enter at Abermenaie
ferrie, into the streicts or streame called Menaie, betweene Angleseie
and the maine, méeting first of all with the Gornaie, which commeth from
the Snowdonie out of the Treuennian lake, and passeth by Lanunda into
the sea or Menaie streame at Southcrocke. Next of all we meet with the
Saint, which commeth from Lin Lanbereie, passeth by Lanihangle, and so
falleth into the Menaie at Abersaint, which is on the southwest side of
Caernaruon: on the other side also of the said towne is the Skeuernocke,
whereby it standeth betweene two riuers, of which this hath his head not
farre from Dinas Orueg.</p>

<p>Then come we (saith Leland) to Gwiniwith mirith (or Horsse brooke) two
miles from Moilethon, and it riseth at a Well so called full a mile from
thence. Moilethon is a bowe shot from Aberpowle, from whence ferrie
<span class="leftnote">Conte.</span>
botes go to the Termone or Angleseie. Aberpowle runneth thrée miles into
the land, and hath his head foure miles beyond Bangor in Meneie shore:
and here is a little comming in for botes bending into the Meneie. Aber
<span class="leftnote">Gegeine.</span>
Gegeine commeth out of a mounteine a mile aboue, and Bangor (thorough
<span class="rightnote">Torronnen.</span>
which a rill called Torronnen hath his course) almost a mile aboue it.
<span class="page"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[Page 138]</span>
<span class="rightnote"><br />Ogwine.</span>
Aber Ogwine is two miles aboue that; it riseth at Tale linne, Ogwine
poole, fiue miles aboue Bangor in the east side of Withow. Aber Auon is
<span class="leftnote">Auon.<br />
Lannar. Vehan.<br />
Duegeuelth.</span>
two miles aboue Aberogwene, and it riseth in a poole called Lin man Auon,
thrée miles off. Auon lan var Vehan riseth in a mounteine therby, and
goeth into the sea, two miles aboue Duegeuelth. Auon Duegeuelth is three
miles aboue Conweie, which rising in the mounteins a mile off, goeth by
it selfe into Meneie salt arme. On the said shore also lieth Conweie,
and this riuer dooth run betwixt Penmaine Maur, and Penmaine Vehan. It
riseth about three miles from Penmaclon hils which lie about sixtie
miles from Conweie abbeie, now dissolued out of a lake called Lin
Conweie, and on the north and west of this riuer standeth the towne of
Conweie, which taketh his name thereof.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Téec.</span>
This riuer (which Ptolomie calleth Toesobius, as I take it) after the
deriuation thereof from the head, passeth on the west side by Spittieuan
and Tiherio, beneath which it taketh in a streame comming from the east
out of Denbighshire, deriued from thrée heads, and of the greatest
called Nag. Soone after also another, and then the third, which commeth
in from the west by Lanpen Mawr: next of all the Leder on the same side,
which commeth by Dolathelan castell: and aboue that from a Lin of the
<span class="leftnote">Ligow.</span>
same denomination. Beneath this and selfe hand lieth likewise the Ligow
or Ligwie, procéeding from two lakes, that is, the Mumber and the Ligow.
On the right hand as we still descend, is the Coid, then the Glin, &amp; a
little lower we méet with the Lin Gerioneth: and after we be past
another on the right side, we come to the Perloid, which commeth out of
Lin Cowlid, to the Ygan, to the Idulin, to the castell Water on the
left, &amp; then to the Melandider on the right, without the sight of anie
other, till we come almost to Conweie, where we find a notched streame
comming from by west, and called Guffen or Gyffin into the same by one
chanell on the northeast side of the towne, beneath Guffin or Gyffin,
and ouer against Lansanfraid in Denbighshire; so farre as I now
remember. Some part of Carnaruonshire stretcheth also beyond Aber
<span class="rightnote">Ormeshed.</span>
Conweie, or the fall of Conweie, &amp; it is called Ormeshed point, wherein
also is a rill, whose fall into the sea is betwéene Penrin and
Landright. And thus we haue made an end of the chéefe waters which are
to be found in this countie.</p>

<p>The next is a corner of Denbigh, by which we doo as it were step ouer
into Flintshire, and whose first water is not great, yet it commeth from
southwest, and falleth into the north or Irish sea called Virginium,
beneath Landilas; as the next that commeth south from Bettas dooth the
<span class="rightnote">Gele.</span>
like thrée miles beneath Abergele, and is not onelie called Gele (as the
name it selfe importeth) but also noted to take his course through the
Canges. Hauing thus gone ouer the angle of Denbighshire, that lieth
betwéene those of Carnaruon and Flint, we come next of all vnto Aber
Cluide, or the fall of Clotha or Glota, which is a streame not to be
shortlie intreated of. It riseth among certeine hilles, which lie not
far distant from the confines of Merioneth and Denbighshires. Southeast
from his fall, and hauing run foure or fiue miles from the head, it
<span class="leftnote">Maniton.</span>
commeth about to Darwen, taking in the Maniton on the left hand, and the
Mespin on the right: and soone after the third from bywest, whose head
is not farre from Gloucanocke. Beneath Ruthen also it taketh in the
Leueneie: and after that another, and the third, all on the right hand,
<span class="leftnote">Cluedoch.</span>
and so holdeth on till it méet with the Cluedoch, then with the Ystrade,
which passeth by Whitchurch on the left hand. After which we come to the
Whéeler on the right, and so to his ioining with the Elwie, which is
<span class="leftnote">Elwie.</span>
beneath S. Asaphes, a bishops sée that is inuironed with them both. This
Elwie riseth aboue Gwitherne, &amp; beneath Lanuair taketh in the Alode,
which commeth from lin Alode, by Lansannan, and ioineth with him fiue
miles beneath Langrenew. The Cluda therefore and the Elwie being met,
the confluence passeth on to the sea by Rutland castell, where it taketh
in the Sarne, which commeth from by east, and hath a course almost of
sixteene miles. From hence we tooke sea toward the Dée mouth: and as we
passed by the rest of the shore, we saw the fall of a little brooke
néere Basing Werke, of another néere to Flint, of the third at Yowleie
castell, which with his two armes in maner includeth it; and the fourth
beneath Hawarden hold, which in like sort goeth round about the same, &amp;
from whence we came to the Dée, where we landed and tooke vp our lodging
<span class="page"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[Page 139]</span>
in Chester. In this place also it was no hard matter to deliuer &amp; set
downe the names of such riuers and streames as are also to be found in
Angleseie, finding my selfe to haue some leasure and fit opportunitie
for the same: and imagining a iourneie thither also, as vnto the other
places mentioned in this description, whither as yet it hath not béene
my hap to trauell: I thought it not amisse to take it also in hand, and
performe it after this maner.</p>
<p>
Ferrieng therefore ouer out of Carnaruonshire to Beaumarise, I went by
land without crossing of anie riuer or streame worthie memorie, till I
came to the Brant, which hath his fall not farre from the southest point
of that Iland. This Brant riseth farre vp in the land, not farre from
Lauredenell, and holding on his course southward to Lanthoniell Vaall,
it goeth on to Bodoweruch, Langainwen, and so into the sea.</p>
<p>
The next fall we came vnto was called Maltrath, and it is producted by
the confluence of two riuers, the Geuennie and the Gint, who ioine not
farre from Langrestoll. This also last rehearsed hath his head neere to
Penmoneth, the other being forked riseth in the hillie soile aboue
Tregaion and Langwithlog: so that part of the Iland obteineth no small
commoditie and benefit by their passage. Next vnto this we came vnto the
<span class="leftnote">Fraw.</span>
Fraw, whose head is neere to Langinewen, and passage by Cap Maer; after
which it falleth into a lake, from whence it goeth east of Aberfraw, and
so into the sea. The next riuer hath no name to my knowledge: yet hath
it a longer course than that which I last described. For it riseth two
or thrée miles aboue Haneglosse: and passing from thence to
Treualghmaie, after the descent of foure miles, it falleth into the sea.
After this we came to an other, which riseth more to Cap legan ferwie,
and falleth into the sea; southeast of the little Iland, which is called
Ynis Wealt, it is namelesse also as the other was: and therefore hauing
small delight to write thereof, we passed ouer the salt créeke by a
bridge into Cair Kibie, which by the same, is as it were cut from the
maine Iland, and in some respect not vnworthie to be taken for an Ile.
In the north side therefore of Cair Kibie is a little rill or créeke:
but whether the water thereof be fresh or salt, as yet I doo not
remember.</p>
<p>
This place being viewed, I came backe againe by the aforesaid bridge,
into the maine of Angleseie, and going northwards I find a fall inforced
by thrée riuerets, each one hauing his course almost south from other;
and the last falling into the confluence of the two first, not halfe a
mile from the west, where I first espied the streame: the name of the
<span class="leftnote">Linon.<br />
Allo.</span>
most northerlie is Linon, of the second Allo; but the third is
altogither namelesse for aught that I can learne, wherefore it shall not
be necessarie to spend anie time in the further searching of his course.
Being past this, we went northwards till we came to the point, and then
going eastward, we butted vpon the fall of a certeine confluence growing
by the ioining of the Nathanon and the Geger, which méet beneath and
néere to the Langechell. And after the same we passed on somewhat
declining southward by the Hillarie point, toward the southeast, till we
came to the Dulesse: and from thence to Pentraeth water: after which we
turned northward, then eastward; and finallie southward, till we came to
Langurdin; from whence vnto Beaumarise (where began our voiage) we find
not anie water worthie to be remembred. And thence I go forward with the
description of the Dee.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Dée or Deua.</span>
The Dee or Deua (as Ptolomie calleth it) is a noble riuer, &amp; breeder of
the best trout, whose head is in Merioneth shire, about thrée miles
aboue the lake, situate in the countie of Penthlin, and called Lin
Tegnis, whose streame yet verie small, by reason of the shortnesse of
his course, falleth into the said lake, not far from Lanullin. There are
sundrie other waters which come also into the said lake, which is foure
or five miles in length, and about two miles ouer; as one from by south,
whose fall is east, and not manie furlongs from the Dee: another hath
his issue into the same by Langower: the third on the north side of
Lanullin, named Leie: the fourth at Glanlintegid called Jauerne, the
lake it selfe ending about Bala, and from thence running into the
<span class="leftnote">Trowerin.</span>
Trowerin, a pretie streame, and not a little augmented by the Kelme and
Monach which fall by north into the same, and ioineth with the Dée south
of Lanuair; from whence forth it looseth the name, and is afterward
<span class="rightnote">Ruddoch.</span>
called Dée. East of Bala in like sort it receiueth the Ruddoch, then the
<span class="rightnote"><br />Cleton.</span>
<span class="page"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[Page 140]</span>
Cleton, and so passing on by Landright to Langar, it méeteth with a
confluence procéeding from the Alwen and the Giron, of which this riseth
in the hils aboue Langham, the other in the mounteines about fiue or six
miles by northwest of Lanihangle in Denbighshire, where (as I gesse) it
falleth into the ground; and afterward rising againe betwéene Lanihangle
and Bettus, it holdeth on about two miles, and then ioineth with the
Giron, full six miles aboue Dole, and before it come to the Dee. From
hence the Dee goeth by Lansanfraid, and the marches of Merioneth into
Denbighshire, and so to Langellon, Dinas, Bren, &amp;c: kéeping his course
<span class="leftnote">Gristioneth.</span>
by certeine windlesses, till he receiue the Gristioneth, descending by
Ruabon, then another est of the same; the third from by west called
<span class="leftnote">Keriog.</span>
Keriog (whose head is not farre from the bounds of Merioneth and course
by Lanarmon, Lansanfraid, and Chirke) the fourth from south east out of
Shropshire, called Morlais, and so passeth as bounds betwéene
Denbighshire, and the Outliggand of Flintshire, to wit by Bistocke on
the one side and Bangor on the other, till it come to Worthenburie:
whereabout it receiueth a chanell descending from foure influences, of
which one commeth by Penlie chappell, the second from Hamnere, which
goeth downe by Emberhall, and falleth in a little by east of the other;
the third from Blackmere (by Whitchurch) &amp;c: and the fourth from
betwéene Chad and Worsall. These two later méeting aboue nether
Durtwich, doo hold on to Talerne, as mine information instructeth me.</p>

<p>From Wrothenburie the Dee goeth northwestwards toward Shocklige, méeting
<span class="leftnote">Cluedoch.</span>
by the waie with the confluence of the Cluedoch (or Dedoch originall
mother to those trouts for which the Dée is commended) and descendeth
<span class="leftnote">Gwinrogh.</span>
from Capell Moinglath) and the Gwinrogh, that runneth through Wrexham,
both ioining a mile and more beneath Wrexham, not far from Hantwerne.
Soone after also our maine riuer receiueth another becke from by east,
which is bound on the northwest side to the Outliggand of Flintshire,
and so passeth on betwéene Holt castell and Ferneton, Almere and Pulton,
as march betwéene Denbighshire and Cheshire, and then taketh in the
<span class="leftnote">Alannus.</span>
Alannus or Alen; a pretie riuer and worthie to be described. The head of
this Alen therefore is in Denbighshire, and so disposed that it riseth
in two seuerall places, ech being two miles from other, the one called
Alen Mawr, the other Alen Vehan, as I doo find reported. They méet also
beneath Landegleie, and run northwards till they come beyond Lanuerres,
where meeting with a rill comming from by west, it runneth on to the
Mold to Horsheth, and so in and out to Greseford, taking the Cagidog
from southwest with it by the waie; then to Traue Alen, and so into the
Dée, a mile and more aboue the fall of Powton becke, which also
descendeth from southwest out of Flintshire, and is march vnto the same,
euen from the verie head. After which confluence the Dée hauing
Chestershire on both sides, goeth to Aldford with a swift course, where
it méeteth with the Beston brooke, whereof I doo find this description
following.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Beston.</span>
"The Beston water riseth in the wooddie soile betwéene Spruston and
Beston castell with a forked head, and leauing Beston towne on the
northeast, it goeth to Tarneton, and to Hakesleie, where it diuideth it
selfe in such wise, that one branch thereof runneth by Totnall,
Goldburne, and Léehall, to Alford, and so into the Dée, the other by
Stapleford, Terwine, Barrow, Picton, and Therton, where it brancheth
againe, sending foorth one arme by Stanneie poole, and the parke side
into Merseie arme, toward the northwest, and another by southwest, which
commeth as it were backe againe, by Stoke, Croughton, Backeford,
Charleton, Vpton, the Baites, and so vnder a bridge to Chester ward,
where it falleth into the Dée arme at Flockes brooke, excluding Wirall
on the northwest as an Iland, which lieth out like a leg betwéene the
Merseie and the Dée armes, and including and making another fresh Iland
within the same, whose limits by northwest are betwéene Thorneton,
Chester, &amp; Aldford, on the northeast Thorneton and Hakesleie, and on the
southeast Hakesleie and Aldford, whereby the forme thereof dooth in part
resemble a triangle." And thus much of the Dée, which is a troublesome
streame when the wind is at southwest, and verie dangerous, in so much
that few dare passe thereon. Sometimes also in haruest time it sendeth
downe such store of water, when the wind bloweth in the same quarter,
<span class="page"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[Page 141]</span>
that it drowneth all their grasse and corne that groweth in the lower
grounds néere vnto the bankes thereof. Certes it is about thrée hundred
foot, at his departure from the Tignie, and worthilie called a litigious
streame; because that by often alteration of chanell, it inforceth men
to séeke new bounds vnto their lands, for here it laieth new ground, and
there translateth and taketh awaie the old, so that there is nothing
more vnconstant than the course of the said water. Of the monasterie
Bangor also, by which it passeth after it hath left Orton bridge, I find
this note, which I will not omit, because of the slaughter of monks made
sometime néere vnto the same. For although the place require it not, yet
I am not willing altogither to omit it.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">The situation of the monasterie of Bangor.</span>
This abbeie of Bangor stood sometime in English Mailor, by hither and
south of the riuer Dée. It is now ploughed ground where that house
stood, by the space of a Welsh mile (which reacheth vnto a mile and an
halfe English) and to this day the tillers of the soile there doo plow
vp bones (as they saie) of those monks that were slaine in the quarrell
of Augustine, and within the memorie of man some of them were taken vp
in their rotten weeds, which were much like vnto those of our late
blacke monks, as Leland set it downe: yet Erasmus is of the opinion,
that the apparell of the Benedictine monks was such as most men did
weare generallie at their first institution. But to proceed. This abbeie
stood in a valleie, and in those times the riuer ran hard by it. The
compasse thereof likewise was as the circuit of a walled towne, and to
this daie two of the gates may easilie be discerned, of which the one is
named Port Hogan lieng by north, the other Port Clais situat vpon the
south. But the Dée hauing now changed his chanell, runneth through the
verie middest of the house betwixt those two gates, the one being at the
left a full halfe mile from the other. As for the squared stone that is
found hereabout, and the Romane coine, there is no such necessitie of
the rehersall therof, but that I may passe it ouer well inough without
anie further mention.</p>

<p>Being past the Dée we sailed about Wirall, passing by Hibrie or Hilbrée
Iland, and Leuerpole, Nasse, making our entrie into Merseie arme by
Leuerpole hauen, where we find a water falling out betwéene Seacombe and
the Ferie, which dooth in maner cut off the point from the maine of
Wirall. For rising néere to the northwest shore, it holdeth a course
directlie toward the southeast by Wallaseie and Poton, and so leaueth
all the north part beyond that water a peninsula, the same being three
square, inuironed on two sides with the Ocean, &amp; on the third with the
aforesaid brooke, whose course is well néere three miles except I be
deceiued. Fr&#333; hence entring further into the hauen, we find another
fall betwéene Bebington and Brombro chappell, descending from the
hilles, which are seene to lie not farre from the shore, and thence
crossing the fall of the Beston water, we come next of all vnto the
<span class="leftnote">Wiuer.</span>
Wiuer, than the which I read of no riuer in England that fetcheth more
or halfe so many windlesses and crinklings, before it come at the sea.
It riseth at Buckle hilles, which lie betwéene Ridleie and Buckle
townes, and soone after making a lake of a mile &amp; more in length called
Ridleie poole, it runneth by Ridleie to Chalmondlie.</p>

<p>Thence it goeth to Wrenburie, where it taketh in a water out of a moore
<span class="leftnote">Combrus.</span>
that commeth from Marburie: and beneth Sandford bridge the Combrus from
Combermer or Comber lake: and finallie the third that commeth from about
Moneton, and runneth by Langerslaw, then betweene Shenton and Atherlie
parkes, and so into the Wiuer, which watereth all the west part of
England, and is no lesse notable than the fift Auon or third Ouze,
whereof I haue spoken alreadie. After these confluences it hasteth also
<span class="leftnote">Betleie.</span>
to Audlem, Hawklow, and at Barderton crosseth the Betleie water, that
runneth by Duddington, Widdenberie, and so by Barderton into the
aforesaid streame. Thence it goeth to Nantwich, but yer it come at
<span class="leftnote">Salop.</span>
Marchford bridge, it meeteth with a rill called Salopbrooke (as I gesse)
comming from Caluerleie ward, and likewise beneath the said bridge, with
<span class="leftnote">Lée and Wuluarne.</span>
the Lée and the Wuluarne both in one chanell, wherof the first riseth at
Weston, the ether goeth by Copnall. From hence the Wiuer runneth on to
Minchion and Cardeswijc, and the next water that falleth into it is the
<span class="rightnote">Ashe.</span>
Ashe (which passeth by Darnall Grange) and afterward going to Warke, the
vale Roiall, and Eaton, it commeth finallie to Northwich where it
<span class="page"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[Page 142]</span>
<span class="leftnote"><br />Dane.</span>
receiueth the Dane, to be described as followeth. The Dane riseth in the
verie edges of Chester, Darbishire, &amp; Staffordshire, and comming by
Warneford, Swithamleie and Bosleie, is a limit betwéene Stafford and
Darbie shires, almost euen from the verie head, which is in Maxwell
forrest.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bidle.</span>
It is not long also yer it doo méet with the Bidle water, that commeth
by Congerton, and after the confluence goeth vnto Swetham, the
Heremitage, Cotton and Croxton, there taking in two great waters,
<span class="leftnote">Whelocke.</span>
whereof the one is called Whelocke, which comming from the edge of the
countie by Morton to Sandbach, crosseth another that descended from
church Cawlhton, and after the confluence goeth to Warmingham, ioining
also beneath Midlewish with the Croco or Croxston, the second great
water, whose head commeth out of a lake aboue Bruerton (as I heare) and
<span class="leftnote">Croco.</span>
thence both the Whelocke and the Croco go as one vnto the Dane, at
Croxton, as the Dane dooth from thence to Bostocke, Dauenham, Shebruch,
Shurlach, and at Northwich into the foresaid Wiuer. After this
confluence the Wiuer runneth on to Barneton, and there in like sort
receiueth two brookes in one chanell, whereof one commeth from aboue
Allostocke, by Holme &amp; Lastocke, the other from beyond Birtles mill, by
<span class="rightnote">Piuereie.</span>
Chelford (where it taketh in a rill called Piuereie) thence to ouer
<span class="leftnote">Waterlesse.</span>
Peuer, Holford, and there crossing the Waterlesse brooke (growing of two
becks and ioining at nether Tableie) it goeth foorth to Winshambridge,
and then méeting with the other, after this confluence they procéed till
they come almost at Barneton, where the said chanell ioineth with a
pretie water running thorough two lakes, whereof the greatest lieth
betwéene Comberbach, Rudworth and Marburie. But to go forward with the
course of the maine riuer. After these confluences our Wiuer goeth to
Warham, Actonbridge, and Dutton, ouer against which towne, on the other
side it méeteth with a rill, comming from Cuddington: also the second
going by Norleie, and Gritton, finallie the third soone after from
Kimsleie, and then procéedeth on in his passage by Asheton chappell,
Frodesham, Rockesauage, and so into the sea: and this is all that I doo
find of the Wiuer, whose influences might haue beene more largelie set
downe, if mine iniunctions had béene amplie deliuered, yet this I hope
may suffice for his description, and knowledge of his course.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Merseie.</span>
The Merseie riseth among the Peke hils, and from thence going downe to
the Woodhouse, and taking sundrie rilles withall by the waie, it
becommeth the confines betwéene Chester and Darbishires. Going also
toward Goitehall, it méeteth with a faire brooke increased by sundrie
<span class="leftnote">Goite.</span>
waters called Goite, whereof I find this short and briefe description.
The Goite riseth not far from the Shire méere hill (wherein the Doue and
the Dane haue their originall) that parteth Darbishire and Chestershire
in sunder, and thence commeth downe to Goite houses, Ouerton, Taxhall,
<span class="leftnote">Frith.</span>
Shawcrosse, and at Weibridge taketh in the Frith, and beneath Berdhall,
<span class="rightnote">Set.</span>
the Set that riseth aboue Thersethall and runneth by Ouerset. After this
confluence also the Merseie goeth to Goite hall, &amp; at Stockford or
<span class="leftnote">Tame.</span>
Stopford towne méeteth with the Tame, which diuideth Chestershire and
Lancastershire in sunder, and whose head is in the verie edge of
Yorkeshire, from whence it goeth southward to Sadleworth Firth, then to
Mukelhirst, Stalie hall, Ashdon Vnderline, Dunkenfield, Denton, Reddish,
and so at Stockford into the Merseie streame, which passeth foorth in
like sort to Diddesbirie, receiuing a brooke by the waie that commeth
from Lime parke, by Brumhall parke and Chedle.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Irwell.</span>
From Diddesbirie it procéedeth to Norden, Ashton, Aiston, Flixston,
where it receiueth the Irwell a notable water, and therefore his
description is not to be omitted before I doo go forward anie further
with the Merseie, although it be not nauigable by reason of sundrie
rockes and shalowes that lie dispersed in the same. It riseth aboue
Bacop, and goeth thence to Rosendale, and in the waie to Aitenfield it
taketh in a water from Haselden. After this confluence it goeth to
<span class="leftnote">Ræus, or Rache.</span>
Newhall, Brandlesham, Brurie, and aboue Ratcliffe ioineth with the Rache
<span class="rightnote">Leland speaketh of the Corue water about
Manchester; but I know nothing of his course.</span>
water, a faire streame and to be described when I haue finished the
Irwell, as also the next vnto it beneath Ratcliffe, bicause I would not
haue so manie ends at once in hand wherewith to trouble my readers.
Being therfore past these two, our Irwell goeth on to Clifton, Hollond,
Edgecroft, Strengwaies, and to Manchester, where it vniteth it selfe
<span class="leftnote">Yrke.</span>
with the Yrke, that runneth thereinto by Roiton Midleton, Heaton hill,
<span class="page"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[Page 143]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Medlockte.</span>
and Blackeleie. Beneath Manchester also it méeteth with the Medlocke
that commeth thither from the northeast side of Oldham, and betwéene,
Claiton and Garret Halles, and so betwéene two parkes, falling into it
about Holne. Thence our Irwell going forward to Woodsall, Whicleswijc,
Ecles, Barton, and Deuelhom, it falleth néere vnto Flixton, into the
water of Merseie, where I will staie a while withall, till I haue
brought the other vnto some passe, of which I spake before.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Rache.</span>
The Rache, Rech or Rish consisteth of sundrie waters, whereof ech one in
maner hath a proper name, but the greatest of all is Rache it selfe,
which riseth among the blacke stonie hils, from whence it goeth to
<span class="leftnote">Beile.</span>
Littlebrough, and being past Clegge, receiueth the Beile, that commeth
thither by Milneraw chappell. After this confluence also, it méeteth
<span class="leftnote">Sprotton.</span>
with a rill néere vnto Rachedale, and soone after with the Sprotton
<span class="rightnote">Sudleie.</span>
water, and then the Sudleie brooke, whereby his chanell is not a little
increased, which goeth from thence to Grisehirst and so into the Irwell,
<span class="leftnote"><br />Bradsha.</span>
before it come at Ratcliffe. The second streame is called Bradsha. It
riseth of two heds, aboue Tureton church, whence it runneth to Bradsha,
<span class="rightnote">Walmesleie.</span>
and yer long taking in the Walmesleie becke, they go in one chanell till
they come beneath Bolton in the More. From hence (receiuing a water that
commeth from the roots of Rauenpike hill by the way) it goeth by Deane
and Bolton in the More, and so into Bradsha water, which taketh his waie
to Leuermore, Farnworth, Leuerlesse, and finallie into the Irwell, which
I before described, and whereof I find these two verses to be added at
the last</p>

<p class="ind1">Irke, Irwell, Medlocke, and Tame,<br />
When they meet with the Merseie, do loose their name.</p>

<p>
Now therefore to resume our Merseie, you shall vnderstand that after his
confluence with the Irwell, he runneth to Partington, and not farre from
<span class="leftnote">Gles.</span>
thence interteineth the Gles, or Glesbrooke water, increased with
sundrie armes, wherof one commeth from Lodward, another from aboue
Houghton, the third from Hulton parke, and the fourth from Shakerleie:
and being all vnited néere vnto Leigh, the confluence goeth to Holcroft,
and aboue Holling gréene into the swift Merseie. After this increase the
said streame in like sort runneth to Rigston, &amp; there admitteth the
<span class="leftnote">Bollein brooke.</span>
Bollein or Bolling brooke water into his societie, which rising néere
the Chamber in Maxwell forrest goeth to Ridge, Sutton, Bollington,
Prestbirie, and Newton, where it taketh in a water comming from about
Pot Chappell, which runneth from thence by Adlington, Woodford,
<span class="leftnote">Birkin.</span>
Wimesleie, Ringeie, and Ashleie, there receiuing the Birkin brooke that
commeth from betwéene Allerton and Marchall, by Mawberleie, and soone
<span class="leftnote">Mar.</span>
after the Marus or Mar, that commeth thereinto from Mar towne, by
Rawstorne, and after these confluences goeth on to Downham, and ouer
against Rixton beneath Crosford bridge into the Merseie water, which
procéeding on, admitteth not another that méeteth with all néere Lim
before it go to Thelwall. Thence also it goeth by Bruche and so to
Warrington, a little beneath crossing a brooke that commeth from Par by
Browseie, Bradleie, and Saukeie on the one side, and another on the
other that commeth thither from Gropenhall, and with these it runneth on
to nether Walton, Acton grange, and so to Penkith, where it interteineth
<span class="rightnote">Bold.</span>
<span class="leftnote"><br />Grundich.</span>
the Bold, and soone after the Grundich water on the other side, that
passeth by Preston, and Daresbirie. Finallie our Merseie going by
Moulton, it falleth into Lirepoole, or as it was called of old
Liuerpoole hauen, when it is past Runcorne. And thus much of the
Merseie, comparable vnto the Wiuer, and of no lesse fame than most
riuers of this Iland.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Tarbocke.</span>
Being past these two, we come next of all to the Tarbocke water, that
falleth into the sea at Harbocke, without finding anie mo till we be
past all Wirall, out of Lirepoole hauen, and from the blacke rockes that
lie vpon the north point of the aforesaid Iland. Then come we to the
<span class="leftnote">Alt or Ast.</span>
Altmouth, whose fresh rising not far into the land, commeth to Feston,
and soone after receiuing another on the right hand, that passeth into
it by Aughton, it is increased no more before it come at the sea.
Neither find I anie other falles till I méet with the mouth of the
<span class="leftnote">Duglesse or Dulesse.</span>
Yarrow and Duglesse, which haue their recourse to the sea in one chanell
as I take it. The Duglesse commeth from by west of Rauenspike hill, and
yer long runneth by Andertonford to Worthington, and so (taking in two
or thrée rilles by the waie) to Wigen, where it receiueth two waters in
<span class="page"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[Page 144]</span>
one chanell, of which one commeth in south from Brin parke, the other
from northeast. Being past this, it receiueth one on the north side from
Standish, and another by south from Hollond, and then goeth on toward
<span class="leftnote">Taud or Skelmere.</span>
Rufford chappell taking the Taud withall, that descendeth from aboue
Skelmersdale towne, and goeth through Lathan parke, belonging (as I
heare) vnto the earle of Derbie. It méeteth also on the same side,
<span class="leftnote">Merton.</span>
with Merton méere water, in which méere is one Iland called Netholme
beside other, and when it is past the hanging bridge, it is not long yer
it fall into the Yarrow.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Yarrow.</span>
<span class="rightnote">Bagen.</span>
The Yarrow riseth of two heads, whereof the second is called Bagen
brooke, and making a confluence beneath Helbie wood, it goeth on to
Burgh, Eglestan, Crofton, and then ioineth next of all with the
Dugglesse, after which confluence, the maine streame goeth foorth to
Bankehall, Charleton, How, Hesket, and so into the sea. Leland writing
of the Yarrow, saith thus of the same, so fare as I now remember. Into
the Dugglesse also runneth the Yarrow, which commeth within a mile or
thereabout of Chorleton towne, that parteth Lelandshire from
Derbieshire. Vnder the foot of Chorle also I find a rill named Ceorle,
and about a mile and a halfe from thence a notable quarreie of stones,
whereof the inhabitants doo make a great boast and price. And hitherto
to Leland.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Ribble.</span>
The Ribble, a riuer verie rich of salmon, and lampreie, dooth in manner
inuiron Preston in Andernesse, and it riseth neere to Kibbesdale aboue
Gisborne, from whence it goeth to Sawleie or Salleie, Chathburne,
<span class="leftnote">Odder.</span>
Woodington, Clithero castell, and beneath Mitton méeteth the Odder at
north west, which riseth not farre from the crosse of Gréet in
Yorkeshire, and going thence to Shilburne, Newton, Radholme parke, and
Stonie hirst, it falleth yer long into the Ribble water. From hence the
<span class="leftnote">Calder.</span>
Ribble water hath not gone farre, but it méeteth with the Calder from
southeast. This brooke riseth aboue Holme church in Yorkeshire, which
lieth by east of Lancastershire, and going by Towleie and Burneleie,
where it receiueth a trifling rill, thence to Higham, and yer long
crossing one water that commeth from Wicoler by Colne, and another by
<span class="leftnote">Pidle.</span>
and by named Pidle brooke, that runneth by New church in the Pidle, it
méeteth with the Calder, which passeth foorth to Paniam; and thence
receiuing a becke on the other side, it runneth on to Altham, and so to
<span class="leftnote">Henburne.</span>
Martholme, where the Henburne brooke dooth ioine withall, that goeth by
Akington chappell, Dunkinhalgh, Rishton, and so into the Calder, as I
haue said before. The Calder therefore being thus inlarged, runneth
foorth to Reade, where maister Nowell dwelleth, to Whallie, and soone
after into Ribble, that goeth from this confluence to Salisburie hall,
Ribchester, Osbastin, Samburie, Keuerden, Law, Ribbles bridge, &amp; then
<span class="leftnote">Darwent.</span>
taketh in the Darwent, before it goeth by Pontwarth or Pentwarth into
the maine sea. The Darwent diuideth Lelandshire from Andernesse, and it
riseth by east aboue Darwent chappell; and soone after vniting it selfe
<span class="rightnote">Blackeburne.<br />
Rodlesworth.</span>
with the Blackeburne, and Rodlesworth water, it goeth through Houghton
parke, by Houghton towne, to Walton hall, and so into the Ribble. As for
<span class="leftnote">Sannocke.</span>
the Sannocke brooke, it riseth somewhat aboue Longridge chappell, goeth
to Broughton towne, Cotham, Lée hall, and so into Ribble. And here is
all that I haue to saie of this riuer.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Wire.</span>
The Wire riseth eight or ten miles from Garstan, out of an hill in
Wiresdale forrest, from whence it runneth by Shireshed chappell, and
then going by Wadland, or Waddiler, Grenelaw castell (which belongeth to
the erle of Darbie) Garstan, and Kirkland hall, it first receiueth the
<span class="leftnote">Calder. 2.</span>
second Calder, that commeth downe by Edmerseie chappell, then another
chanell increased with sundrie waters, which I will here describe before
I procéed anie further with the Wire. I suppose that the first water is
<span class="leftnote">Plimpton.</span>
called Plimpton brooke, it riseth south of Gosner, and commeth by
<span class="rightnote">Barton.</span>
Cawford hall, and yer long receiuing the Barton becke, it procéedeth
<span class="leftnote">Brooke.</span>
forward till it ioineth with the Brooke rill that commeth from Bowland
forrest, by Claughton hall, where master Brookehales dooth lie, &amp; so
through Mersco forrest. After this confluence the Plime or Plimpton
water méeteth with the Calder, and then with the Wire, which passeth
<span class="leftnote">Skipton.</span>
foorth to Michaell church, and the Raw cliffes, and aboue Thorneton
crosseth the Skipton that goeth by Potton, then into the Wire rode, and
<span class="page"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[Page 145]</span>
finallie through the sands into the sea, according to his nature. When
we were past the fall of the Wire, we coasted vp by the salt cotes, to
<span class="rightnote">Coker.</span>
Coker mouth, whose head, though it be in Weresdale forrest, not far from
that of the Wire, yet the shortnesse of course deserueth no description.
<span class="leftnote">Cowdar.</span>
The next is Cowdar, which is comming out of Wire dale, as I take it, is
not increased with anie other waters more than Coker, and therefore I
will rid my hands thereof so much the sooner.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Lune.</span>
Being past these two, I came to a notable riuer called the Lune or
Loine, or (as the booke of statutes hath) Lonwire Anno 13 Ric. 2. cap.
19, and giueth name to Lancaster, Lonecaster, or Lunecaster, where much
Romane monie is found, and that of diuerse stamps, whose course dooth
rest to be described as followeth; and whereof I haue two descriptions.
The first being set downe by Leland, as master Moore of Catharine hall
in Cambridge deliuered it vnto him. The next I exhibit as it was giuen
vnto me, by one that hath taken paines (as he saith) to search out and
view the same, but verie latelie to speake of. The Lune (saith master
Moore) of some commonlie called the Loine, riseth at Crosseho, in Dent
dale, in the edge of Richmondshire out of thrée heads. North also from
Dent dale is Garsdale, an vplandish towne, wherein are séene manie times
great store of red déere that come downe to feed from the mounteins into
the vallies, and thereby runneth a water, which afterward commeth to
Sebbar vale, where likewise is a brooke méeting with Garsdale water, so
that a little lower they go as one into Dent dale becke, which is the
riuer that afterward is called Lune, or Lane, as I haue verie often
noted it. Beside these waters also before mentioned, it receiueth at the
foot of Sebbar vale, a great brooke, which commeth out of the Worth,
betwéene Westmerland and Richmondshire, which taking with him the
aforesaid chanels, dooth run seauen miles yer it come to Dent dale foot.
From hence it entreth into Lansdale, corruptlie so called, peraduenture
for Lunesdale, &amp; runneth therein eight or nine miles southward, and in
this dale is Kirbie. Hitherto master Moore, as Leland hath exemplified
that parcell of his letters. But mine other note writeth hereof in this
<span class="leftnote">Burbecke.</span>
manner. Burbecke water riseth at Wustall head, by west, and going by
Wustall foot to Skaleg, it admitteth the Breder that descendeth thither
<span class="leftnote">Breder.</span>
from Breder dale. From hence our Burbecke goeth to Breder dale foot, &amp;
so to Tibarie, where it méeteth with foure rilles in one bottome, of
which one commeth from besides Orton, another from betwéene Rasebecke
and Sunbiggin, the third and fourth from each side of Langdale: and
after the generall confluence made, goeth toward Roundswath, aboue which
<span class="leftnote">Barrow.</span>
it vniteth it selfe with the Barrow. Thence it runneth to Howgill,
Delaker, Firrebanke, and Killington, beneath which it meeteth with a
<span class="leftnote">Dent.</span>
water comming from the Moruill hilles, and afterward crossing the Dent
brooke, that runneth thither from Dent towne, beneath Sebbar, they
continue their course as one into the Burbecke, from whence it is called
Lune. From hence it goeth to Burbon chappell, where it taketh in another
rill comming from by east, then to Kirbie, Lansbele, and aboue
Whittenton crosseth a brooke comming from the countie stone by Burros,
<span class="leftnote">Greteie.</span>
and soone after beneath Tunstall and Greteie, which descending from
about Ingelborow hill, passeth by Twiselton, Ingleton, Thorneton,
Burton, Wratton, and néere Thurland castell, toucheth finallie with the
Lune, which brancheth, and soone after vniteth it selfe againe. After
<span class="rightnote">Wennie.</span>
this also it goeth on toward New parke, and receiueth the Wennie, and
<span class="leftnote">Hinburne.</span>
the Hinburne both in one chanell, of which this riseth north of the
crosse of Greteie, and going by Benthams and Roberts hill, aboue Wraie
<span class="leftnote">Rheburne.</span>
taketh in the Rheburne that riseth north of Wulfecrag. After this
confluence also aboue New parke, it maketh his gate by Aughton,
Laughton, Skirton, Lancaster, Excliffe, Awcliffe, Soddaie, Orton, and so
into the sea. Thus haue you both the descriptions of Lune, make your
conference or election at your pleasure, for I am sworne to neither of
them both.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Docker.</span>
The next fall is called Docker, and peraduenture the same that Leland
<span class="rightnote">Kerie.</span>
dooth call the Kerie, which is not farre from Wharton, where the rich
Kitson was borne, it riseth north of Docker towne, and going by Barwijc
hall, it is not increased before it come at the sea, where it falleth
into the Lune water at Lunesands. Next of all we come to Bitham beck,
<span class="page"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[Page 146]</span>
which riseth not far from Bitham towne and parke, in the hilles, where
about are great numbers of goates kept and mainteined, and by all
likelihood resorteth in the end to Linsands.</p>

<p>Being past this, we find a forked arme of the sea called Kensands: into
the first of which diuerse waters doo run in one chanell, as it were
from foure principall heads, one of them comming from Grarrig hall,
another fr&#333; by west of Whinfield, &amp; ioining with the first on the east
<span class="leftnote">Sprota.</span>
side of Skelmere parke. The third called Sprot or Sprota riseth at
Sloddale, &amp; commeth downe by west of Skelmer parke, so that these two
brookes haue the aforesaid parke betwéene them, &amp; fall into the fourth
east of Barneside, not verie farre in sunder. The fourth or last called
<span class="leftnote">Ken.</span>
Ken, commeth from Kentmers side, out of Ken moore, in a poole of a mile
compasse, verie well stored with fish, the head whereof, as of all the
baronie of Kendall is in Westmerland, &amp; going to Stauelope, it taketh in
a rill from Chappleton Inges. Then leauing Colnehead parke by east, it
passeth by Barneside, to Kendall, Helston, Sigath, Siggeswijc,
Leuenbridge, Milnethorpe, and so into the sea. Certes this Ken is a
pretie déepe riuer, and yet not safelie to be aduentured vpon, with
boates and balingers, by reason of rolling stones, &amp; other huge
substances that oft annoie &amp; trouble the middest of the chanell there.
<span class="leftnote">Winstar.</span>
The other péece of the forked arme, is called Winstar, the hed wherof is
aboue Winstar chappell, &amp; going downe almost by Carpmaunsell, &amp;
Netherslake, it is not long yer it fall into the sea, or sands, for all
this coast, &amp; a gulfe from the Ramside point to the Mealenasse, is so
pestered with sands, that it is almost incredible to sée how they
increase. Those also which inuiron the Kenmouth, are named Kensands: but
such as receiue the descent from the Fosse, Winander, and Sparke, are
called Leuesands, as I find by sufficient testimonie. The mouth or fall
of the Dodon also is not farre from this impechment: wherefore it is to
be thought, that these issues will yer long become verie noisome, if not
<span class="leftnote">Winander.</span>
choked vp altogither. The Winander water riseth about Cunbalrasestones,
from whence it goeth to Cangridge, where it maketh a méere: then to
Ambleside, and taking in yer it come there, two rilles on the left hand,
and one on the right that commeth by Clapergate, it maketh (as I take
it) the greatest méere, or fresh water in England; for I read it is ten
miles in length. Finallie, comming to one small chanell aboue Newbridge,
it reacheth not aboue six miles yer it fall into the sea. There is in
<span class="leftnote">Fosse.</span>
like sort a water, called the Fosse that riseth néere vnto Arneside, and
Tillerthwates, and goeth foorth by Grisdale, Satrethwate, Rusland,
Powbridge, Bowth, and so falleth with the Winander water into the maine
sea. On the west side of the Fosse also commeth another through Furnesse
felles, and from the hilles by north thereof, which yer long making the
Thurstan lake not far from Hollinhow, and going by Bridge end, in a
narrow channell, passeth foorth by Nibthwaits, Blareth, Cowlton, &amp;
<span class="leftnote">Sparke.</span>
Sparke bridge, and so into the sea. Hauing passed the Leuen or
Conisands, or Conistonesands, or Winander fall (for all is one) I come
<span class="rightnote">Lew.</span>
to the Lew, which riseth at Cewike chappell, and falleth into the sea
<span class="leftnote">Rawther.</span>
beside Plumpton. The Rawther descending out of low Furnesse, hath two
heads, whereof one commeth from Penniton, the other by Vlmerstone
abbeie, and ioining both in one chanell, they hasten into the sea,
whither all waters direct their voiage. Then come we to another rill
southwest of Aldingham, descending by Glaiston castell; and likewise the
fourth that riseth néere Lindell, and running by Dawlton castell and
Furnesse abbeie, not farre from the Barrow head, it falleth into the sea
ouer against Waueie and Waueie chappell, except mine aduertisements
misleade me.</p>
<p>
The Dodon, which from the head is<span class="leftnote">Dodon.</span>
bound vnto Cumberland and Westmerland,
commeth from the Shire stone hill bottome, and going by Blackehill,
Southwake, S. Iohns, Vffaie parke, &amp; Broughton, it falleth into the
orltwater, betwéene Kirbie, and Mallum castell. And thus are we now come
vnto the Rauenglasse point, and well entred into the Cumberland countie.</p>

<p>Comming to Rauenglasse, I find hard by the towne a water comming from
two heads, and both of them in lakes or pooles, whereof one issueth out
<span class="rightnote">Denocke.</span>
of Denocke or Deuenocke méere, and is called Denocke water, the other
<span class="page"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[Page 147]</span>
<span class="leftnote"><br />Eske.</span>
named Eske from Eske poole which runneth by Eskedale, Dalegarth, and
soone after meeting with the Denocke, betwéene Mawburthwate and
Rauenglasse, falleth into the sea. On the other side of Rauenglasse also
<span class="rightnote">Mite.</span>
commeth the Mite brooke, from Miterdale as I read. Then find we another
which commeth from the hils, and at the first is forked, but soone after
making a lake, they gather againe into a smaller chanell: finallie
<span class="leftnote">Brenge.</span>
meeting with the Brenge, they fall into the sea at Carleton southeast, as
<span class="rightnote">Cander.</span>
I wéene of Drig. The Cander, or (as Leland nameth it) the Calder,
commeth out of Copeland forrest, by Cander, Sellefield, and so into the
sea. Then come we to Euer water, descending out of a poole aboue
Coswaldhow, and thence going by Euerdale, it crosseth a water from
Arladon, and after procéedeth to Egremond, S. Iohns, and taking in
another rill from Hide, it is not long yer it méeteth with the sea.</p>

<p>The next fall is at Moresbie, whereof I haue no skill. From thence
therefore we cast about by saint Bees to Derwentset hauen, whose water
<span class="leftnote">Dargwent.</span>
is truelie written Dargwent or Deruent. It riseth in the hils about
Borrodale, from whence it goeth vnto the Grange, thence into a lake, in
which are certeine Ilands, and so vnto Keswijc, where it falleth into
<span class="leftnote">Burthméere.</span>
the Bure, whereof the said lake is called Bursemere, or the Burthmere
poole. In like sort the Bure or Burthmere water, rising among the hils
goeth to Tegburthesworth, Forneside, S. Iohns, and Threlcote: and there
<span class="leftnote">Grise.</span>
méeting with a water from Grisdale, by Wakethwate, called Grise, it
runneth to Burnesse, Keswijc, and there receiueth the Darwent. From
Keswijc in like sort it goeth to Thorneswate (and there making a plash)
to Armanswate, Isell, Huthwate and Cokermouth, and here it receiueth the
<span class="leftnote">Cokar.</span>
Cokar, which rising among the hils commeth by Lowsewater, Brakenthwate,
Lorton, and so to Cokarmouth towne, from whence it hasteth to Bridgeham,
and receiuing a rill called the Wire, on the south side that runneth by
Dein, it leaueth Samburne and Wirketon behind it, and entereth into the
sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Wire.</span>
Leland saith that the Wire is a créeke where ships lie off at rode, and
that Wirketon or Wirkington towne dooth take his name thereof. He addeth
also that there is iron and coles, beside lead ore in Wiredale.
Neuerthelesse the water of this riuer is for the most part sore
troubled, as comming thorough a suddie or soddie more, so that little
<span class="leftnote">Elmus.</span>
good fish is said to liue therein. But to proceed. The Elme riseth in
the mines aboue Amautrée, and from Amautre goeth to Yeresbie, Harbie,
Brow, and there taking in a rill on the left hand comming by Torpennie,
it goeth to Hatton castell, Alwarbie, Birthie, Dereham, and so into the
sea. Thence we go about by the chappell at the point, and come to a baie
serued with two fresh waters, whereof one rising westward goeth by
Warton, Rabbie, Cotes, and so into the maine, taking in a rill withall
<span class="rightnote">Croco.</span>
from by south, called Croco, that commeth from Crockdale, by Bromefield.
<span class="leftnote">Vamus.</span>
The second is named Wampoole broocke, &amp; this riseth of two heads,
whereof one is about Cardew. Thence in like sort it goeth to Thuresbie,
Croston, Owton, Gamlesbie, Wampall, the Larth, and betwéene Whiteridge
and Kirbie into the saltwater. From hence we double the Bowlnesse, and
come to an estuarie, whither thrée notable riuers doo resort, and this
is named the Solueie mouth. But of all, the first excéedeth, which is
called Eden, and whose description dooth follow here at hand.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Eden.</span>
The Eden well fraught with samon, descendeth (as I heare) from the hils
in Athelstane moore at the foot of Hussiat Moruell hil, where Swale also
riseth, and southeast of Mallerstang forrest. From thence in like maner
it goeth to Mallerstang towne, Pendragon castell, Wharton hall, Netbie,
Hartleie castell, Kirkebie Stephan, and yer it come at great Musgrane,
<span class="leftnote">Helbecke.</span>
it receiueth thrée waters, whereof one is called Helbecke, bicause it
commeth from the Derne and Elinge mounteins by a towne of the same
<span class="leftnote">Bellow.</span>
denomination. The other is named Bellow, and descendeth from the east
mounteins by Sowarsbie, &amp; these two on the northeast: the third falleth
from Rauenstandale, by Newbiggin, Smardale, Soulbie, Blaterne, and so
<span class="leftnote">Orne.</span>
into Eden, that goeth from thence by Warcop; and taking in the Orne
<span class="rightnote">Moreton.<br />
Dribecke.</span>
about Burelles on the one side, and the Morton becke on the other, it
hasteth to Applebie, thence to Cowlbie, where it crosseth the Dribecke,
<span class="page"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[Page 148]</span>
<span class="leftnote"><br />Trowt becke.</span>
<span class="rightnote"><br /><br />Liuenet.</span>
thence to Bolton, and Kirbie, and there méeting with the Trowt becke,
and beneath the same with the Liuenet (whereinto falleth an other water
from Thurenlie méeting withall beneath Clebron) it runneth finallie into
Eden. After the confluences also the Eden passeth to Temple, and soone
<span class="leftnote"><br />Milburne.<br />
Blincorne.</span>
after meeting with the Milburne and Blincorne waters, in one chanell, it
runneth to Winderwarth and Hornebie, where we will staie till I haue
described the water that meeteth withall néere the aforesaid place
<span class="rightnote">Vlse.</span>
called the Vlse.</p>

<p>This water commeth out of a lake, which is fed with six rils, whereof
<span class="leftnote">Marke.</span>
one is called the Marke, and néere the fall thereof into the plash is a
towne of the same name; the second hight Harteshop, &amp; runneth from
<span class="leftnote">Harteshop.</span>

Harteshop hall by Depedale; the third is Paterdale rill; the fourth
<span class="rightnote">Paterdale.<br />
Roden.</span>
Glent Roden, the fift Glenkguin, but the sixt runneth into the said
<span class="leftnote">Glenkguin.</span>
lake, south of Towthwate. Afterward when this lake commeth toward Pole
towne, it runneth into a small chanell, &amp; going by Barton, Dalumaine, it
taketh in a rill by the waie from Daker castell. Thence it goeth to
Stockebridge, Yoneworth, and soone after méeteth with a pretie brooke
<span class="leftnote">Loder.</span>
called Loder, comming from Thornethwate by Bauton, and héere a rill;
then by Helton, and there another; thence to Askham, Clifton, and so
ioining with the other called Vlse, they go to Brougham castell, Nine
churches, Hornebie, and so into Eden, taking in a rill (as it goeth)
that commeth downe from Pencath. Being past Hornebie, our Eden runneth
to Langunbie, and soone after receiuing a rill that commeth from two
heads, and ioining beneath Wingsell, it hasteth to Lasenbie, then to
Kirke Oswald (on ech side whereof commeth in a rill from by east) thence
to Nonneie, and there a rill, Anstable, Cotehill, Corbie castell,
Wetherall, Newbie: where I will staie, till I haue described the Irding,
and such waters as fall into the same before I go to Carleill.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Irding.</span>
The Irding ariseth in a moore in the borders of Tindale, néere vnto
<span class="rightnote">Terne.</span>
Horsse head crag, where it is called Terne becke; vntill it come to
Spicrag hill, that diuideth Northumberland and Gillesland in sunder,
from whence it is named Irding. Being therfore come to Ouerhall, it
<span class="rightnote">Pultrose.</span>
receiueth the Pultrose becke, by east, and thence goeth on to
Ouerdenton, Netherdenton, Leuercost, and Castelstead, where it taketh in
<span class="rightnote">Cambocke.</span>
the Cambocke, that runneth by Kirke Cambocke, Askerton castell, Walton,
and so into Irding, which goeth from thence to Irdington, Newbie, &amp; so
into Eden. But a little before it come there, it crosseth with the
<span class="leftnote">Gillie.</span>
Gillie that commeth by Tankin, and soone after falleth into it. After
these confluences, our Eden goeth to Linstocke castell, (and here it
interteineth a brooke, comming from Cotehill ward by Aglionbie) and then
vnto Carleill, which is now almost inuironed with foure waters.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Pedar aliàs Logus.</span>
For beside the Eden it receiueth the Peder, which Leland calleth Logus
from southeast. This Peder riseth in the hils southwest of Penruddocke,
from whence it goeth to Penruddocke, then to Grastocke castell,
Cateleie, and Kenderside hall, and then taking in a water from Vnthanke,
it goeth to Cathwade, Pettrelwaie, Newbiggin, Carleton, and so into
<span class="leftnote">Bruferth.</span>
Eden, northeast of Carleill. But on the north side the Bruferth brooke
dooth swiftlie make his entrance, running by Leuerdale, Scalbie castell,
and Housedon; as I am informed. The third is named Candan (if not Deua
after Leland) which rising about the Skidlow hils, runneth to Mosedale,
Caldbecke, Warnell, Saberham, Rose castell, Dawston, Brounston,
Harrington, and west of Carleill falleth into Eden, which going from
thence by Grimsdale, Kirke Andros, Beaumont, falleth into the sea
beneath the Rowcliffe castell. And thus much of the Eden, which Leland
neuerthelesse describeth after another sort, whose words I will not let
to set downe here in this place, as I find them in his commentaries.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Vlse after Leland.</span>
The Eden, after it hath run a pretie space from his head, méeteth in
time with the Vlse water, which is a great brooke in Westmerland, and
rising aboue Maredale, a mile west of Loder, it commeth by the late
<span class="leftnote">Loder.</span>
dissolued house of Shappe priorie, thrée miles from Shappe, and by
Brampton village into Loder or Lodon. Certes this streame within halfe a
mile of the head, becommeth a great lake for two miles course, and
afterward waxing narrow againe, it runneth foorth in a meane and
<span class="leftnote">Aimote.</span>
indifferent bottome. The said Eden in like sort receiueth the Aimote
about thrée miles beneath Brougham castell, and into the same Aimote
<span class="page"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[Page 149]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Dacor.</span>
falleth Dacor becke (alreadie touched) which riseth by northwest in
Materdale hils, foure miles aboue Dacor castell, and then going through
Dacor parke, it runneth by east a good mile lower into Eimote, a little
beneath Delamaine, which standeth on the left side of Dacor. In one of
his bookes also he saith, how Carleill standeth betwéene two streames,
<span class="leftnote">Deua.</span>
that is to saie the Deua, which commeth thither from by southwest, and
also the Logus that descendeth from the southeast. He addeth moreouer
<span class="leftnote">Vala.</span>
how the Deua in times past was named Vala or Bala, and that of the names
of these two, Lugibala for Caerleill hath beene deriued, &amp;c. And thus
much out of Leland. But where he had the cause of this his coniecture as
yet I haue not read. Of this am I certeine, that I vse the names of most
riuers here and else-where described, accordinglie as they are called in
my time, although I omit not to speake here and there of such as are
more ancient, where iust occasion mooueth me to remember them, for the
better vnderstanding of our histories, as they doo come to hand.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Leuen.</span>
Blacke Leuen and white Leuen waters, fall into the sea in one chanell,
<span class="rightnote">Lamford.<br />
Eske.</span>
and with them the Lamford and the Eske, the last confluence being not a
full mile from the maine sea. The white and blacke Leuen ioining
<span class="leftnote">Tomunt.</span>
therfore aboue Bucknesse, the confluence goeth to Bracken hill,
Kirkleuenton, and at Tomunt water meeteth with the Eske. In like sort
<span class="leftnote">Kirsop.<br />
Lidde.</span>
the Kirsop ioining with the Lidde out of Scotland at Kirsop foot,
running by Stangerdike side, Harlow, Hathwater, and taking in the Eske
aboue the Mote, it looseth the former name, and is called Eske, vntill
it come to the sea.</p>

<p>Hauing thus gone thorough the riuers of England, now it resteth that we
procéed with those which are to be found vpon the Scotish shore, in such
order as we best may, vntill we haue fetched a compasse about the same,
and come vnto Barwike, whence afterward it shall be easie for vs to make
repaire vnto the Thames, from which we did set forward in the
beginning of our voiage. The first riuer that I met withall on the
<span class="leftnote">Eske.</span>
Scotish coast, is the Eske, after I came past the Solueie, which hath
his head in the Cheuiot hilles, runneth by Kirkinton, and falleth into
the sea at Borow on the sands. This Eske hauing receiued the Ewis
falleth into the Solueie first at Atterith. After this I passed ouer a
little créeke from Kirthell, and so to Anand, whereof the vallie
Anandale dooth séeme to take the name. There is also the Nide, whereof
commeth Nidsdale, the Ken, the Dée, the Crale, and the Bladnecke, and
all these (besides diuerse other small rilles of lesse name) doo lie
vpon the south of Gallowaie.</p>

<p>On the north side also we haue the Ruan, the Arde, the Cassile Dune, the
Burwin, the Cluide (wherevpon sometime stood the famous citie of
Alcluide, and whereinto runneth the Carath) the Hamell, the Dourglesse,
and the Lame. From hence in like maner we came vnto the Leuind mouth,
wherevnto the Blake on the southwest and the Lomund Lake, with his
fléeting Iles and fish without finnes (yet verie holesome) dooth séeme
to make his issue. This lake of Lomund in calme weather ariseth
sometimes so high, and swelleth with such terrible billowes, that it
causeth the best marriners of Scotland to abide the leisure of this
water, before they dare aduenture to hoise vp sailes on hie. The like is
seene in windie weather, but much more perillous. There are certeine
Iles also in the same, which mooue and remooue, oftentimes by force of
the water, but one of them especiallie, which otherwise is verie
fruitfull for pasturage of cattell.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Leue. Long. Goile.<br />

Next vnto this is the Leue, the Rage, the Long, the Goile, &amp; the Heke,
which for the excéeding greatnesse of their heads, are called lakes.
Then haue we the Robinseie, the Foreland, the Tarbat, the Lean, and the
Abir, wherevnto the Spanseie, the Loine, the Louth, the Arke, and the
Zefe doo fall, there is also the Sell, the Zord, the Owin, the Newisse,
the Orne, the Lang, the Drun, the Hew, the Brun, the Kell, the Dowr, the
Faro, the Nesse, the Herre, the Con, the Glasse, the Maur, the Vrdall,
the Fers (that commeth out of the Caldell) the Fairsoke, which two latter
lie a little by west of the Orchades, and are properlie called riuers,
bicause they issue onelie from springs; but most of the other lakes,
bicause they come from linnes and huge pooles, or such low bottomes,
<span class="page"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[Page 150]</span>
fed with springs, as séeme to haue no accesse, but onelie recesse of
waters, whereof there be manie in Scotland.</p>

<p>But to proceed. Hauing once past Dungisbie head in Cathnesse, we shall
yer long come to the mouth of the Wifle, a prettie streame, comming by
<span class="leftnote">Wifle. Browre.<br />
Clin. Twin. Shin.<br />
Sillan. Carew.<br />
Nesse. Narding.<br />
Spaie. Downe.<br />
Dée. Eske.</span>
south of the mounteins called the Maidens pappes. Then to the Browre,
the Clin, the Twin (whereinto runneth three riuers, the Shin, the
Sillan, and Carew) the Nesse, which beside the plentie of samon found
therein is neuer frosen, nor suffereth yee to remaine there, that is
cast into the poole. From thence we come vnto the Narding, the Finderne,
the Spaie (which receiues the Vine) the Fitch, the Bulich, the Arrian,
the Leuin, and the Bogh, from whence we saile vntill we come about the
Buquhan head, and so to the Downe, and Dee: which two streames bring
forth the greatest samons that are to be had in Scotland, and most
plentie of the same. Then to the north Eske, whereinto the Esmond
runneth aboue Brechin, the south Eske, then the Louen and the Taw, which
is the finest riuer for water that is in all Scotland, and wherevnto
most riuers and lakes doo run. As Farlake, Yrth, Goure, Loich, Cannach,
Linell, Loion, Irewer, Erne, and diuerse other besides small rillets
which I did neuer looke vpon.</p>

<p>Then is there the lake Londors, vpon whose mouth saint Andrewes dooth
stand, the lake Lewin vnto whose streame two other lakes haue recourse
in Fifland, and then the Firth or Fortha, which some doo call the
Pictish and Scotish sea, whither the kingdome of the Northumbers was
sometime extended, and with the riuer last mentioned (I meane that
commeth from Londors) includeth all Fife, the said Fortha being full of
oisters and all kinds of huge fish that vse to lie in the déepe. How
manie waters run into the Firth, called by Ptolomie Lora, it is not in
my power iustlie to declare: yet are there both riuers, rills, &amp; lakes
<span class="leftnote">Clacke. Alon. Dune.<br />
Kerie. Cambell. Cumer.<br />
Tere. Man. Torkesan.<br />
Rosham. Mushell. Blene.</span>
that fall into the same, as Clacke, Alon, Dune, Kerie, Cambell, Cumer,
Tere, Man, Torkeson, Rosham, Mushell, Blene, and diuerse other which I
call by these names, partlie after information, and partlie of such
townes as are neere vnto their heads. Finallie, when we are past the
Haie, then are we come vnto the Twede, whereinto we entred, leauing
<span class="rightnote">Twede.</span>
Barwike on the right hand and his appurtenances, wherein Halidon hill
standeth, and conteineth a triangle of so much ground beyond the said
riuer, as is well néere foure miles in length, and thrée miles in bredth
in the broad end: except mine information doo faile me.</p>

<p>The Twede (which Ptolomie nameth Toualsis or Toesis, &amp; betwéene which
and the Tine the countie of Northumberland is in maner inclosed, and
watred with sundrie noble riuers) is a noble streame and the limes or
bound betwéene England &amp; Scotland, wherby those two kingdomes are now
diuided in sunder. It riseth about Drimlar in Eusbale (or rather out of
a faire well (as Leland saith) standing in the mosse of an hill called
Airstane, or Harestan in Twede dale ten miles from Pibble) and so
comming by Pibble, Lander, Dribiwgh, Lelse, Warke, Norham and
Hagarstone, it falleth into the sea beneath Barwike, as I heare. Thus
saith Leland. But I not contented with this so short a discourse of so
long a riuer &amp; briefe description of so faire a streame, will ad
somewhat more of the same concerning his race on the English side, and
rehearsall of such riuers as fall into it. Comming therefore to Ridam,
it receiueth betwéene that and Carham a becke, which descendeth from the
hilles that lie by west of Windram. Going also from Ridam by
Longbridgham (on the Scotish side) and to Carham, it hasteth immediatlie
to Warke castell on the English, and by Spilaw on the other side, then
to Cornewall, Cald streame, and Tilmouth, where it receiueth sundrie
waters in one botome which is called the Till, and whose description
insueth here at hand.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Till.</span>
Certes there is no head of anie riuer that is named Till, but the issue
of the furthest water that commeth hereinto, riseth not farre from the
head of Vswaie in the Cheuiot hilles, where it is called Brennich,
whereof the kingdome of Brennicia did sometime take the name. From
thence it goeth to Hartside, Ingram, Branton, Crawleie, Hedgeleie,
Beueleie, and Bewijc, beneath which it receiueth one water comming from
Rodham by west, and soone after a second descending from the Middletons,
<span class="leftnote">Bromis.</span>
and so they go as one with the Bromish, by Chatton to Fowbreie (where
they crosse the third water falling downe by north from Howborne by
<span class="page"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[Page 151]</span>
Heselbridge) thence to Woller, there also taking in a rill that riseth
about Middleton hall, and runneth by Hardleie, Whereleie, and the rest
afore remembred, wherby the water of Bromis is not a little increased,
and after this latter confluence beneath Woller, no more called Bromis
but the Till, vntill it come at the Twede. The Till passing therefore by
Weteland and Dedington, méeteth soone after with a faire streame comming
<span class="leftnote">Bowbent.</span>
from by southwest, which most men call the Bowbent or Bobent.</p>

<p>It riseth on the west side of the Cocklaw hill, and from thence hasteth
to Hattons, beneath the which it ioineth from by southeast with the
Hellerborne, and then goeth to Pudston, Downeham, Kilham, and a little
by north of Newton Kirke, and betweene it and west Newton, it taketh in
another water called Glin, comming from the Cheuiot hilles by Heth
poole, and from thenseforth runneth on without anie further increase, by
Copland Euart, and so in the Till. The Till for his part in like sort
after this confluence goeth to Broneridge, Fodcastell, Eatall castell,
Heaton, &amp; north of Tilmouth into the Twede, or by west of Wesell, except
my memorie dooth faile me. After this also our aforesaid water of Twede
descendeth to Grotehugh, the Newbiggins, Norham castell, Foord,
<span class="leftnote">Whitaker.</span>
Lungridge, &amp; crossing the Whitaker on the other side from Scotland
beneath Cawmill, it runneth to Ordo, to Barwike, and so into the Ocean,
leauing (as I said) so much English ground on the northwest ripe, as
lieth in manner of a triangle betwéene Cawmils, Barwike, and Lammeton,
which (as one noteth) is no more but two miles and an halfe euerie waie,
or not much more; except he be deceiued.</p>

<p>Being past this noble streame, we came by a rill that descendeth from
Bowsden by Barington. Then by the second which ariseth betwéene
Middleton and Detcham or Dereham, and runneth by Eskill and the Rosse,
next of all to Warnemouth, of whose backe water I read as followeth. The
<span class="leftnote">Warne.</span>
Warne or Gwerne riseth southwest of Crokelaw, and going by Warneford,
Bradford, Spindlestone, and Budill, it leaueth Newton on the right hand,
and so falleth into the Ocean, after it hath run almost nine miles from
the head within the land, and receiued a rill beneath Yessington, which
commeth downe betweene Newland and Olchester, and hath a bridge beneath
the confluence, which leadeth ouer the same. From Warnemouth we sailed
by Bamborow castell, and came at last to a fall betweene Bedwell and
Newton. The maine water that serueth this issue, riseth aboue Carleton
from the foot of an hill, which séemeth to part the head of this and
that of Warne in sunder. It runneth also by Carleton, Tonleie, Doxford,
Brunton, and Tuggell, and finallie into the sea, as to his course
apperteineth.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Aile, or Alne,
aliàs Chalne.</span>
From this water we went by Dunstanbugh castell, vnto the Chalne or
Alnemouth, which is serued with a pretie riueret called Alne, the head
whereof riseth in the hils west of Alnham towne, and called by Ptolomie,
Celnius. From thense also it runneth by Rile, Kile, Eslington, and
Whittingham, where it crosseth a rill comming from by south, and beneath
the same, the second that descendeth from Eirchild at Brone, &amp; likewise
the third that riseth at Newton, and runneth by Edlingham castell and
Lemmaton (all on the southeast side or right hand) and so passeth on
further, till it meet with the fourth, comming from aboue Shipleie from
by north, after which confluence it goeth to Alnewijc, &amp; then to
Dennijc, receiuing there a rillet from by south and a rill from by
north, and thence going on to Bilton, betweene Ailmouth towne and
Wooddon, it sweepeth into the Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Cocket.</span>
The Cocket is a goodlie riuer, the head also thereof is in the roots of
Kemblespeth hils, from whence it goeth to Whiteside, and there meeting
<span class="leftnote"><br />Vswaie.</span>
with the Vswaie (which descendeth from the north) it goeth a little
<span class="rightnote">Ridleie.</span>]
further to Linbridge, and there receiueth the Ridleie by southwest, and
after that with another, called (as I thinke) the Hoc, which commeth
from the Woodland and hillie soile by Allington, &amp; falleth into the
same, west of Parke head. It ioineth also yer long with the Ridland,
which commeth in north by Bilstone, and then hieth to Sharpton, to
<span class="leftnote">Yardop.</span>
Harbotle, where it crosseth the Yardop water by south, then to
Woodhouse, and swallowing in a little becke by the waie from southwest,
to Bickerton, to Tossons, Newton, and running apace toward Whitton
towre, it taketh a brooke withall that commeth in northwest of Alnham,
<span class="page"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[Page 152]</span>
néere Elihaw, and goeth by Skarnewood, ouer nether Trewhet, Snitter, and
Throxton, and soone after vniteth it selfe with the Cocket, from whence
<span class="rightnote">It may be Leland mistaketh
Tickington water for one of these.</span>
they go together to Rethburie, or Whitton towre, to Halie, to
Brinkehorne, Welden, taking withall soone after the Tod or burne called
Tod, which falleth in from by south, then to Elihaw, Felton (receiuing
thereabout the Fareslie brooke, that goeth by Wintring by south east,
and Sheldike water, that goeth by Hason, to Brainsaugh by north) and
from thence to Morricke, Warkworth castell, and so into the sea.</p>

<p>There is furthermore a little fall, betwéene Hawkeslaw and Drurith,
which riseth about Stokes wood, goeth by east Cheuington, and
<span class="leftnote">Lune.</span>
Whittington castell, and afterward into the Ocean. The Lune is a pretie
brooke rising west of Espleie, from whence it goeth to Tritlington,
<span class="leftnote">Wansbecke.</span>
Vgham, Linton, and yer long in the sea. Wansbecke (in old time Diua) is
far greater than the Lune. It issueth vp west and by north of west
Whelpington, thence it runneth to Kirke Whelpington, Wallington,
Middleton, and Angerton. Heere it méeteth with a water running from
about Farnelaw by the grange, and Hartburne on the north, and then going
from Angerton, it runneth by Moseden to Mitforth, and there in like
<span class="leftnote">Font.</span>
maner crosseth the Font, which issuing out of the ground about
Newbiggin, goeth by Nonneie Kirke, Witton castell, Stanton, Nunriding,
Newton, and so into the Wansbecke, which runneth in like maner from
Mitford to Morpheth castell (within two miles whereof it ebbeth and
floweth) the new Chappell, Bottle castell, Shepwash, and so into the
sea, thrée miles from the next hauen which is called Blithe.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Blithe.</span>
Blithe water riseth about kirke Heaton, and goeth by Belfe, Ogle, and
(receiuing the Port aliàs the Brocket, that springeth east of S.
Oswolds) passeth by Portgate, Whittington, Fennike hall, Madfennes,
Hawkewell, the Grange, &amp; Dissingtons. After it hath taken in the Pont
<span class="leftnote">Hartleie.</span>
from the east (whose head is not farre from that of Hartleie streame)
and is past Barwijc on the hill, it runneth by Harford, Bedlington,
Cowpon, and at Blithes nuke, into the deepe Ocean. Hartleie streamelet
riseth in Wéeteslade parioch, goeth by Haliwell, and at Hartleie towne
yeeldeth to the sea.</p>

<p>The Tine or Tinna, a riuer notablie stored with samon, and other good
fish, and in old time called Alan, riseth of two heads, whereof that
<span class="leftnote">North Tine.</span>
called north Tine, is the first that followeth to be described. It
springeth vp aboue Belkirke in the hils, &amp; thence goeth to Butterhawgh
<span class="leftnote">Shele.</span>
(where it receiueth a confluence of Kirsop and the Shele) thence to
Cragsheles, Leapelish (receiuing on the south a rill out of Tindale)
then to Shilburne, against which it taketh in a becke that commeth out
of Tindale called Shill, also two other on the same side, betweene Yarro
and Fawston hall, and the third at Thorneburne, and so goeth on to
Grenested, and there carrieth withall a fall, from by north also made by
the confluence of one rill comming by Thecam, and another that passeth
by Holinhead, and likewise another on the south comming from Tindale, by
Chuden, Dalacastell, and Brokes: after which our north Tine goeth by
Hellaside, to Billingham, and at Rhedes mouth méeteth with the Ridde, a
verie prettie water, whose description is giuen me after this maner.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Ridde.</span>
The Ridde therefore riseth within thrée miles of the Scotish march, as
Leland saith, &amp; commeth through Riddesdale, wherevnto it giueth the
name. Another writeth how it riseth in the roots of the Carter, and
Redsquibe hilles, and yer it hath gone farre from the head, beside a few
<span class="rightnote">Shelhop.</span>
little rilles it taketh in the Spelhop or Petop from the north and the
<span class="leftnote">Cheslop.</span>
Cheslop on the south, beside sundrie other wild rils nameless and
obscure, as one on the north side next vnto the Petop or Spelhop;
another by south out of Riddesdale, the third west of Burdop, the fourth
runneth by Wullaw to Rochester, then two from southwest, another from by
north which goeth by Durtburne, and is called Durt or Durth, then the
Smalburne from the west. Next to the same is the Otter or Otterburne on
the north side also the Ouereie, and finallie the last which descendeth
from Ellesdon hilles, by Munkrige and ioineth with our Ridde, northwest
of Nudhowgh, after which the said Ridde goeth by Woodburne, Risingham,
Leame, and so into the Tine, a mile lower than Belingham or Bilingham,
which standeth somewhat aloofe from north Tine and is (as I take it) ten
<span class="page"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[Page 153]</span>
miles at the least aboue the towne of Hexham. After this confluence it
<span class="rightnote">3. Burnes.<br />
Shitlington.</span>
passeth to Léehall, to Carehouse (crossing Shitlington becke by west
which also receiueth the Yare on the south side of Shitlington) another
also beneath this on the same side, made by the confluence of
Workesburne, and Middleburne, at Roseburne, beside the third called
Morleis or Morelée aboue, and Simons burne beneath Shepechase, and
likewise the Swine from by north that runneth by Swinburne castell, next
of all the Riall from the northeast, which commeth by Erington, &amp; so
holding his course directlie southwards, it goeth by S. Oswolds through
the Pictishwall, to Wall, and so into south Tine, beneath Accam, and
northwest (as I doo wéene) of Hexham.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Tine. S.</span>
The south Tine ariseth in the Cheuiot hils, and yer it hath gone farre
from the head, it méeteth with Esgill on the east, and another rill on
<span class="rightnote">Esgill.</span>
the west, and so going by the houses toward Awsten moore, it ioineth
with Schud from by west, and soone after with the Vent from by east
<span class="leftnote">Vent.</span>
aboue Lowbier. From Lowbier it goeth to Whitehalton, to Kirke Haugh
<span class="rightnote">Gilders beck.</span>
(crossing the Gilders becke on the one side, and the Alne on the other)
to Thornehope, where it is inlarged with a water on each side, to
<span class="leftnote">Knare.</span>
Williamstone, and almost at Knaresdale, taketh in the Knare, and then
runneth withall to Fetherstone angle. At Fetherstone angle likewise it
méeteth with Hartleie water, by southwest comming from Sibins or
Sibbenes, another a little beneath from southeast, and thence when it
commeth to Billester castell, it carieth another withall from by west,
Thirlewall called Rippall which riseth in the forrest of Lowes, and
goeth by the Waltowne, Blinkinsop, &amp; Widon, and after which confluence
it taketh in another from by north rising west of Swinsheld, which goeth
by Grenelegh to Haltwestell: thence going by Vnthanke, it crosseth
another rill from by south, descending from the hilles that lie north of
Todlewood, and then proceeding vnto Wilmotteswijc, it admitteth the
Wilmots becke from the south, and another running by Bradleie hall on
the north side of Beltingham; after which it méeteth with the Alen a
proper water, and described after this maner.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">East Alen.</span>
The Alen or Alon hath two heads, whereof one is called east Alen, the
other west Alen. The first of them riseth southeast of Sibton Sheles, &amp;
going by Sundorp, it taketh in a rill withall from by est; after which
confluence it runneth to Newshele, Allington, Caddon, Old towne, &amp; in
<span class="leftnote">West Alen.</span>
the course to Stauertpele, méeteth with the west Alen. The west Alen
riseth in Killop low hilles aboue Wheteleie sheles, from whence it goeth
to Spartwell, Hawcopole, Owston, and taking in a rill thereabouts, it
procéedeth on to Permandbie, and crossing there another rill in like
maner from by west, it goeth by Whitefield, and ioining soone after with
the est Alen, they run as one to Stauert poole, Plankford, and so into
the Tine betweene Beltingham and Lées, from whence the Tine runneth on
by Lees Haddon, Woodhall, Owmers, Whernebie, Costleie, &amp; so by Warden,
till it crosse the north Tine, and come to Hexham, from whence it goeth
to Dilstan, crossing two waters by the waie, whereof one commeth from by
south, and is called the Wolsh, which holdeth his course by Stelehall,
and Newbiggin receiueth another comming from Grimbridge: the other
called Dill somewhat lower descending from Hedleie, and running by
Rising, till it fall into the south side of our streame from Dilstan, it
goeth to Bywell castell, ouer against which it receiueth a rill that
runneth by Hindleie, thence it hasteth to Eltingham, Pruddo, Willam,
(and there it meeteth with another becke) then to Reton, Blaidon, and
<span class="leftnote">Darwent.</span>]
next of all ioineth with the Darwent, from by south.</p>

<p>This riuer riseth aboue Knewdon, and Rudlamhope in Northumberland, from
two heads: the northerlie being called Dere, and the southerlie the
Guent: and ioining so well yer long in chanell as in name, they runne on
to Humsterworth, new Biggin, Blankeland, Acton, Aspersheles,
Blackheadlie, Brentfield side, Pansheles, Ebchester, and there taking in
a water from Hedleie in Northumberland, néere to Blacke hall in the
bishoprike, it goeth on to Spen, Hollinside, Wickham, Swalwell, and so
into Tine, which passeth from thence by Elswijc, and méeting with
another water comming from Shildraw, by Rauensworth castell to Redhugh,
it goeth on to Newcastell, Fellin, Netherheworth, Walker, Waswon,
<span class="page"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[Page 154]</span>
Hedburne, and next to Jerro or Girwie, where Beda dwelled in an abbeie;
now a gentlemans place (although the church be made a parish church,
wherevnto diuerse townes resort, as moonke Eaton where Beda was borne,
which is a mile from thence, Southsheles, Harton, Westhow, Hebburne,
Hedworth, Wardleie, Fellin, Follinsbie, the Heworthes) and from thence
to the south and Northsheles, and so into the sea, fiue miles by
northwest of Weremouth, and (as I gesse) somewhat more.</p>

<p>Beneath the confluence in like sort of both the Tines, standeth
Corbridge, a towne sometime inhabited by the Romans, and about twelue
miles from Newcastell, and hereby dooth the Corue run, that meeteth yer
long with the Tine. Not farre off also is a place called Colchester,
wherby Leland gesseth that the name of the brooke should rather be Cole
<span class="leftnote">Corue.</span>
than Corue, and in my iudgement his coniecture is verie likelie; for in
the life of S. Oswijn (otherwise a féeble authoritie) the word Colbridge
is alwaies vsed for Corbridge, whereof I thought good to leaue this
short aduertisement. In this countrie also are the thrée vales or dales,
whereof men haue doubted whether théeues or true men doo most abound in
them, that is to saie, Riddesdale, Tuidale, and Liddesdale: this last
being for the most part Scotish, and without the marches of England.
Neuerthelesse, sithens that by the diligence cheefelie of maister
Gilpin, and finallie of other learned preachers, the grace of God
working with them, they haue béene called to some obedience and zeale
vnto the word, it is found that they haue so well profited by the same,
that at this present their former sauage demeanour is verie much abated,
and their barbarous wildnesse and fiercenesse so qualified, that there
is great hope left of their reduction vnto ciuilitie, and better order
of behauiour than hitherto they haue béene acquainted withall. But to
procéed with the rest.</p>

<p>Ptolomie, writing of the Were,
<span class="rightnote">Were.</span>
calleth it Vedra, a riuer well knowne
vnto Beda the famous préest, who was brought vp in a monasterie that
stood vpon the bankes thereof. It riseth of thrée heads in Kelloppeslaw
<span class="leftnote">Burdop.</span>
hill, whereof the most southerlie is called Burdop, the middlemost
<span class="rightnote">Wallop.<br />
Kellop.</span>
Wallop, and the northerliest Kellop, which vniting themselues about S.
Iohns chappell, or a little by west thereof, their confluence runneth
through Stanhope parke, by east Yare, and so to Frosterleie. But yer it
come there, it receiueth thrée rilles from the north in Weredale,
whereof one commeth in by Stanhope, another west of Woodcroft hall, and
the third at Frosterleie afore mentioned. And a little beneath these, I
find yet a fourth on the south side, which descendeth from southwest by
Bolliop, Bishopsleie, Milhouses, and Landew, as I haue béene informed.
Being therefore vnited all with the Were, this streame goeth on to
<span class="leftnote">Wascrop.</span>
Walsingham, there taking in the Wascropburne, beside another at
Bradleie, the third at Harpleie hall (and these on the north side) and
<span class="leftnote">Bedburne.</span>
the fourth betwéene Witton and Witton castell called Bedburne, comming
by Hamsterleie, whereby this riuer dooth now wax verie great. Going
therefore from hence, it hasteth to Bishops Akeland, and beneath it
receiueth the Garondlesse, which (as Leland saith) riseth six miles by
west of Akeland castell, and running south thereof, passeth by west
Akeland, S. Helens Akeland, S. Andrewes Akeland, and bishops Akeland,
and then into the Were which goeth to Newfield, and Willington. Neere
vnto this place also and somewhat beneath Sunderland, the Were, crosseth
one brooke from southest by Het, Croxseie, Cronefurth, Tursdale, and
Cordale, and two other from by northwest in one botome, whereof the
first commeth from aboue Ash by Langleie: the other called Coue, from
aboue Kinchleie by Newbiggin, Lanchester, north Langlie, and through
Beare parke, &amp; so méeting beneath Kelleie or Hedleie with the other,
they fall both as one into the Were, betweene south Sunderland and
Burnall. From hence our riuer goeth on to Howghwell, Shirkeleie, old
<span class="leftnote">Pidding brooke.</span>
Duresme (and there taking in the Pidding brooke by northeast) it goeth
to Duresme, Finkeleie, Harbarhouse, Lumleie castell (where it méeteth
<span class="leftnote">Pilis.</span>
with the Pilis, whose heads are vnited betweene Pelton and Whitwell (and
after called Hedleie) and from thence to Lampton, Harroton, the Bedikes,
Vfferton, Hilton parke, Bishops Weremouth, and so into the sea, betweene
north Sunderland and north Weremouth towne, which now is called moonke
Weremouth of the monasterie sometime standing there, wherin Beda read &amp;
<span class="page"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[Page 155]</span>
wrote manie of his bookes, as to the world appeareth. This mouth of Were
is eight miles from Durham, and six from Newcastell. Being thus passed
the Were, &amp; entered into the Bishoprijc, yer we come at the mouth of the
These, almost by two miles, ouer passing a rill that runneth by castell
Eden, and Hardwijc, and likewise Hartlepoole towne, which lieth ouer
into the sea in maner of a byland or peninsula, we meet with a prettie
fall, which groweth by a riuer that is increased with two waters,
whereof one riseth by northwest about Moretons, and goeth by Stotfeld
and Claxton, the other at Dawlton, going by Breerton, Owtham, and
Grettam, finallie ioining within two miles of the sea, they make a
prettie portlet: but I know not of what securitie.</p>
<p>
The These, a riuer that beareth and féedeth an excellent samon,
<span class="leftnote">Thesis.</span>
riseth in the Blacke lowes, aboue two miles flat west of the southerlie head of
Were called Burdop, and south of the head of west Alen, and thence
runneth through Tildale forrest: and taking in the Langdon water from
northwest it runneth to Durtpit chappell, to Newbiggin, and so to
Middleton, receiuing by west of each of these a rill comming from by
<span class="leftnote">Hude.</span>
north (of which the last is called Hude) and likewise the Lune afterward
by southwest that riseth at thrée seuerall places, whereof the first is
in the borders of Westmerland and there called Arnegill becke, the
<span class="leftnote">Lune.</span>
second more southerlie, named Lunebecke, and the third by south at
<span class="leftnote"><br />Arnegill.</span>
Bandor Skarth hill, and méeting all aboue Arnegill house, they run
togither in one bottome to Lathekirke bridge, and then into the These.
Hauing therefore met with these, it runneth to Mickelton (&amp; there taking
<span class="leftnote"><br />Skirkewith.</span>
in the Skirkwith water) it goeth to Rombald kirke (crossing there also
<span class="rightnote">Bander.</span>
one rill and the Bander brooke by south west) and then going to Morewood
hag, and Morewood parke, till it come to Bernards castell.</p>
<p>
Here also it receiueth the Thuresgill water, comming east of Rere crosse
<span class="leftnote">Rere crosse.</span>
in Yorkeshire, from the spittle in Stanmore by Crag almost southwest,
and being vnited with the These, it goeth by Stratford, Eglesdon,
Rokesbie, Thorpe, Wickliffe, Ouington, Winston, and betweene Barfurth
and Gainfurth méeteth with another rill, that commeth from Langleie
forest, betwéene Rabie castell and Standorpe, of whose name I haue no
knowledge. But to procéed. The These being past Ramforth, runneth
betwéene Persore and Cliffe, and in the waie to Crofts bridge taketh in
<span class="leftnote">Skerne.</span>
the Skerne a pretie water, which riseth about Trimdon, and goeth by
Fishburne, Bradburie, Preston, Braforton, Skirmingham, the Burdens,
Haughton and Darlington, &amp; there finallie meeting with the Cocke becke
or Dare, it falleth in the These beneath Stapleton, before it come at
Crofts bridge, and (as it should séeme) is the same which Leland calleth
Gretteie or Grettie. From thence it runneth to Sockburne, nether
Dunsleie, Middleton row, Newsham, Yarne (crossing a brooke from Leuen
bridge) called Leuen or Leuinus in Latine, whose crinkling course is
notable, and the streame of some called Thorpe, which I find described
in this maner.</p>
<p>
The Thorpe riseth of sundrie heads, whereof one is aboue Pinching
<span class="leftnote">Thorpe aliàs Leuand.</span>
Thorpe, from whence it goeth to Nonnethorpe, and so to Stokesleie. The
second hath two branches, and so placed, that Kildale standeth betweene
them both: finallie, méeting beneath Easbie they go by Eaton, and
likewise vnto Stokesleie. The last hath also two branches, whereof one
commeth from Inglesbie, and méeteth with the second beneath Broughton; &amp;
going from thence to Stokesleie, they méet with the Thorpe aboue the
towne, as the other fall into it somewhat beneath the same. From hence
it goeth to Ridleie, and there taketh in another rill comming
<span class="leftnote">Crawthorne.</span>
from Potto, thence to Crawthorne brooke, Leuanton, Milton, Hilton,
Inglesbie, and so into the These, betwéene Yarne and Barwijc, whereof I
made mention before. After this confluence our These hasteth on to
Barwijc, Preston, Thorne abbeie, and Arsham, which standeth on the
southeast side of the riuer almost betweene the falles of two waters,
whereof one descendeth from west Hartburne by long Newton, Elton, &amp;
Stockton; the other from Stillington, or Shillington, by Whitton,
Thorpe, Blackestone, Billingham, and Norton. From Arsham finallie it
goeth to Bellasis, Middleburgh, and so into the sea. Leland describing
this riuer speaketh of the Wiske, which should come thereinto from by
<span class="page"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[Page 156]</span>
south vnder Wiske bridge, by Danbie, and Northalarton, and should ioine
with a greater streame: but as yet I find no certeine place where to
bestow the same.</p>
<p>
Next of all we come vnto the high Cliffe water, which rising aboue
Hutton, goeth by Gisborow, and there receiueth another streame comming
from by southeast, and then continuing on his course, it is not long yer
it fall into the sea. The next is the Scaling water, which descendeth
from Scaling towne, from whence we come to the Molemouth, not farre from
whose head standeth Molgraue castell: then to Sandford creeke, and next
<span class="leftnote">Eske.</span>
of all to Eske mouth, which riseth aboue Danbie wood, and so goeth to
Castelton, there méeting by the waie with another rill comming from
about Westerdale by Danbie, and so they go on togither by Armar and
Thwate castell, till they ioine with another water aboue Glasdule
chappell, thence to new Biggin, taking yet another brooke with them,
<span class="leftnote">Ibur.</span>
running from Goodland ward, and likewise the Ibur, and so go on without
anie further increase by Busworth, yer long into the sea.</p>
<p>
There is also a créeke on each side of Robin Whoodes baie, of whose
names and courses I haue no skill, sauing that Fillingale the towne
dooth stand betwéene them both. There is another not far from Scarborow,
on the north side called the Harwood brooke. It runneth through Harwood
dale by Cloughton, Buniston, and soone after méeting with another rill
on the southwest, they run as one into the ocean sea. From Scarborow to
Bridlington, by Flamborow head, we met with no more falles. This water
therefore that we saw at Bridlington, riseth at Dugglebie, from whence
it goeth to Kirbie, Helperthorpe, Butterwijc, Boithorpe, Foxhole, (where
it falleth into the ground, and riseth vp againe at Rudston) Thorpe,
Cathorpe, Bridlington, and so into the Ocean.</p>

<p>Being come about the Spurne head, I meete yer long with a riuer that
riseth short of Withersie, and goeth by Fodringham and Wisted, from
thence to another that commeth by Rosse, Halsham, Carmingham: then to
the third, which riseth aboue Humbleton, and goeth to Esterwijc, Heddon,
and so into the Humber. The fourth springeth short of Sprotleie, goeth
by Witton, and falleth into the water of Humber at Merflete, as I heare.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Hull.</span>
The next of all is the Hull water, which I will describe also here, and
then crosse ouer vnto the southerlie shore. The furthest head of Hull
water riseth at Kilham, from whence it goeth to Lewthorpe créeke, and so
to Fodringham, a little beneath which it meeteth with sundrie waters,
whereof one falleth in on the northest side, comming from about Lisset;
the second on the northwest banke from Nafferton; the third from
Emmeswell and Kirkeburne: for it hath two heads which ioined beneth
little Drifield, and the fourth which falleth into the same: so that
these two latter run vnto the maine riuer both in one chanell, as
experience hath confirmed. From hence then our Hull goeth to Ratseie, to
Goodalehouse, and then taking in a water from Hornesie mere, it goeth on
through Beuerleie medowes, by Warron, Stoneferrie, Hull, and finallie
into the Humber. Of the rill that falleth into this water from south
Netherwijc, by Skirlow, and the two rilles that come from Cottingham and
Woluerton, I saie no more, sith it is enough to name them in their
order.</p>

<small>THE DESCRIPTION OF THE HUMBER OR ISIS, AND SUCH WATER-COURSES AS DOO <br />INCREASE HIR CHANELL.</small><br />

CHAP. XV.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">Humber.</span>
There is no riuer called Humber from the hed. Wherfore that which we now
call Humber, Ptolomie Abie, Leland Aber, as he gesseth, hath the same
denomination no higher than the confluence of Trent with the Ouze, as
beside Leland sundrie ancient writers haue noted before vs both. Certes
it is a noble arme of the sea, and although it be properlie to be called
Ouze or Ocellus euen to the Nuke beneath Ancolme, yet are we contented
<span class="page"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[Page 157]</span>
to call it Humber of Humbrus or Vmar, a king of the Scithians, who
inuaded this Ile in the time of Locrinus, thinking to make himselfe
monarch of the same. But as God hath from time to time singularlie
prouided for the benefit of Britaine, so in this businesse it came to
passe, that Humber was put to flight, his men slaine: and furthermore,
whilest he attempted to saue himselfe by hasting to his ships (such was
the prease of his nobilitie that followed him into his owne vessell, and
the rage of weather which hastened on his fatall daie) that both he and
they were drowned togither in that arme. And this is the onelie cause
wherefore it hath béene called Humber, as our writers saie; and wherof I
find these verses:</p>

<p class="ind1">Dum fugit obstat ei flumen submergitur illic,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Déque suo tribuit nomine nomen aquæ.</p>

<p>This riuer in old time parted Lhoegres or England from Albania, which
was the portion of Albanactus, the yongest sonne of Brute. But since
that time the limits of Lhoegres haue béene so inlarged, first by the
prowesse of the Romans, then by the conquests of the English, that at
this present daie, the Twede on the one side, &amp; the Solue on the other,
be taken for the principall bounds betweene vs and those of Scotland. In
describing therefore the Humber, I must néeds begin with the Ouze, whose
water bringeth foorth a verie sweet, fat and delicat samon, as I haue
béene informed, beside sundrie other kinds of fish, which we want here
on the south and southwest coasts &amp; riuers of our land, whereof I may
take occasion to speake more at large heerafter.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Vre aliàs Ouze, or Isis.</span>
The Vre therfore riseth in the furthest parts of all Richmondshire,
among the Coterine hilles, in a mosse, toward the west fourtéene miles
beyond Midleham. Being therefore issued out of the ground, it goeth to
Holbecke, Hardraw, Hawshouse, Butterside, Askebridge (which Leland
calleth the Askaran, and saith thereof and the Bainham, that they are
but obscure bridges) then to Askarth, through Wanlesse parke, Wenseleie
bridge (made two hundred yeares since, by Alwin, parson of Winslaw) New
parke, Spennithorne, Danbie, Geruise abbeie, Clifton and Masham. When it
<span class="leftnote">Burne.</span>
is come to Masham, it receiueth the Burne, by south west (as it did the
<span class="leftnote">Wile.</span>
Wile, from verie déepe scarrie rockes, before at Askaran) and diuerse
other wild rilles not worthie to be remembred. From Masham, it hasteth
vnto Tanfield (taking in by the waie a rill by southwest) then to
another Tanfield, to Newton hall, and Northbridge, at the hither end of
Rippon, and so to Huickes bridge. But yer it come there it méeteth with
<span class="leftnote">Skell.</span>
the Skell, which being incorporat with the same, they run as one to
Thorpe, then to Alborow, and soone after receiue the Swale.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Swale.</span>
Here (saith Leland) I am brought into no little streict, what to
coniecture of the méeting of Isis and Vre, for some saie that the Isis
and the Vre doo méet at Borowbridge, which to me dooth séeme to be verie
vnlikelie, sith Isurium taketh his denomination of Isis and Vro, for it
is often séene that the lesse riuers doo mingle their names with the
greater, as in the Thamesis and other is easie to be found. Neither is
there any more mention of the Vre after his passage vnder Borowbridge,
but onelie of Isis or the Ouze in these daies, although in old time it
held vnto Yorke it selfe, which of the Vre is truelie called Vrewijc (or
Yorke short) or else my persuasion dooth faile me. I haue red also
Ewerwijc and Yorwijc. But to procéed, and leaue this superfluous
discourse.</p>

<p>From Borowbridge, the Ouze goeth to Aldborough, and (receiuing the Swale
by the waie) to Aldworke, taking in Vsburne water, from the southwest,
then to Linton vpon Ouze, to Newton vpon Ouze, and to Munketun, méeting
with the Nid yer long, and so going withall to the Redhouses, to
<span class="leftnote">Fosse.</span>
Popleton, Clifton, Yorke (where it crosseth the Fosse) to Foulfoorth,
Middlethorpe, Acaster, &amp; Acaster, Kelfléet, Welehall, Barelebie, Selbie,
Turmonhall, Skurthall, Hokelath, Hoke, Sandhall, Rednesse, Whitegift,
Vslet, Blacketoft, Foxfléet, Brownfléet, and so into Humber.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Ouze.</span>
The course of the Ouze being thus described, and as it were simplie
without his influences, now will I touch such riuers as fall into the
same also by themselues, contrarie to my former proceeding, imagining a
voiage from the Rauenspurne, vntill I come néere to the head of These, &amp;
<span class="page"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[Page 158]</span>
so southwards about againe by the bottome of the hillie soile vntill I
get to Buxston, Sheffeld, Scrobie, &amp; the verie south point of Humber
mouth, whereby I shall crosse them all that are to be found in this
walke, &amp; leaue (I doubt) some especiall notice of their seuerall heads
<span class="leftnote">Hull or Hulne.</span>
and courses. The course of the Hull, a streame abounding with sturgeon
and lampreie, as also the riuers which haue their issue into the same,
being (as I say) alreadie described, I thinke it not amisse, as by the
waie to set downe what Leland saith thereof, to the end that his trauell
shall not altogither be lost in this behalfe; and for that it is short,
and hath one or two things worthie to be remembred conteined in the
same.</p>

<p>The Hulne (saith he) riseth of thrée seuerall heads, whereof the
greatest is not far from Driefield, now a small village sixtéene miles
from Hull. Certes it hath beene a goodlie towne, and therein was the
palace of Egbright king of the Northumbers, and place of sepulture of
Alfred the noble king sometime of that nation, who died there 727, the
ninetéene Cal. of Julie, the twentith of his reigne, and whose toombe or
monument dooth yet remaine (for ought that I doo know to the contrarie)
with an inscription vpon the same written in Latine letters. Néere vnto
this towne also is the Danefield, wherein great numbers of Danes were
slaine, and buried in those hils, which yet remaine there to be séene
ouer their bones and carcasses. The second head (saith he) is at
Estburne, and the third at Emmeswell, and méeting all togither not farre
from Drifield, the water there beginneth to be called Hulne, as I haue
said alreadie.</p>

<p>From hence also it goeth through Beuerleie medowes, and comming at the
last not farre from an arme led from the Hulne by mans hand (and able to
beare great vessels) almost to Beuerleie towne, which in old time either
hight or stood in Deirwald, vntill John of Beuerleie (whom Leland nameth
out of an old author to be the first doctor or teacher of diuinitie that
euer was in Oxford, and (as it should séeme also by an ancient monument
yet remaining) to be of an hostell where the vniuersitie college now
standeth; &amp; therfore they write him, Somtime fellow of that house) began
to be of fame, of whom it is called Beuerleie (as some affirme) to this
daie. Indéed all the countrie betwéene the Deirwent &amp; the Humber was
sometime called Deira, and the lower part Caua Deira in respect of the
higher soile, but now it is named the east Riding. But what is this to
my purpose? The Hulne therefore being come almost to Beuerleie towne, &amp;
<span class="leftnote">Cottingham.</span>
méeting thereabout also with the Cottingham becke comming from Westwood
by the waie, it hasteth to Kingston vpon Hulne or Hull, and so into the
Humber without anie maner impeachment.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Fowlneie.</span>
The Fowlneie riseth about Godmanham, from whence it goeth by Wighton,
Hareswell, Seton, Williams bridge, and soone after spreading it selfe,
<span class="leftnote"><br />Skelfléet.</span>
one arme called Skelfleet goeth by Cane Cawseie to Brownefléet and so
into the Ouze. The other passeth by Sandholme, Gilberts dike, Scalbie
chappell, Blacketoft, and so into the aforesaid Ouze, leauing a verie
pretie Iland, which is a parcell (as I heare) of Walding fen more,
though otherwise obscure to vs that dwell here in the south.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Darwent.</span>
The Darwent riseth in the hilles that lie west of Robin Whoodes baie, or
two miles aboue Aiton bridge, west from Scarborow as Leland saith: and
yer it hath run farre from the head, it receiueth two rilles in one
bottome from by west, which ioine withall about Longdale end. Thence
they go togither to Broxeie, and at Hacknesse take in another water
comming from about Silseie. Afterward it commeth to Aiton, then to
<span class="leftnote">Kenford.</span>
Haibridge, and there crosseth the Kenford that descendeth from
Roberteston. After this also it goeth on to Potersbrumton where it
taketh in one rill, as it dooth another beneath running from Shirburne,
and the third yet lower on the further banke, that descendeth from
Brumton. From these confluences it runneth to Fowlbridge, Axbridge,
Yeldingham bridge, &amp; so to Cotehouse, receiuing by the waie manie
waters, &amp; yéelding great plentie of delicate samons to such as fish vpon
the same. Leland reckoning vp the names of the seuerall brookes,
numbreth them confusedlie after his accustomed order. The Darwent (saith
<span class="leftnote">Shirihutton.</span>
he) receiueth diuerse streames, as the Shirihutton. The second is the
<span class="leftnote">Crambecke.<br />
Rie.<br /></span>
<span class="rightnote">Ricoll.<br />
Seuen.<br />
Costeie.<br />
Pickering.</span>
Crambecke, descending from Hunderskell castell (so called Tanquam à
centum fontibus, or multitude of springs that rise about the same) and
<span class="page"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[Page 159]</span>
goeth to Rie, which comming out of the Blackemore, passeth by Riuers
abbeie, taking in the Ricoll on the left hand, then the Seuen, the
Costeie, and Pickering brooke.</p>

<p>The Seuin also (saith he) riseth in the side of Blackemoore, and thence
goeth by Sinnington foure miles from Pickering, and about a mile aboue a
certeine bridge ouer Rie goeth into the streame. The Costeie in like
sort springeth in the verie edge of Pickering towne, at a place called
Keld head, and goeth into the Rie two miles beneath Pickering, about
Kirbie minster. Finallie, Pickering water ariseth in Blackemoore, and
halfe a mile beneath Pickering falleth into Costeie, meeting by the way
<span class="leftnote">Pocklington.</span>
with the Pocklington becke, and an other small rill or two, of whose
names I haue no knowledge. Hitherto Leland. But in mine opinion, it had
béene far better to haue described them thus. Of those waters that fall
into the Darwent beneath Cotehouse, the first commeth from Swenton, the
second from Ebberston, the third from Ollerston, the fourth from
Thorneton &amp; Pickering, and the fift on the other side that commeth
thither from Wintringham. For so should he haue dealt in better order,
and rid his hands of them with more expedition, referring the rest also
vnto their proper places.</p>

<p>But to procéed after mine owne maner. Being past Cotehouse, &amp; yer the
<span class="leftnote">Rie.</span>
Darwent come at Wickham, it crosseth the Rie, which riseth of two heads,
and ioining west of Locton they run through Glansbie parke. Finallie,
<span class="leftnote">Costeie.</span>
receiuing the Costeie, it méeteth at the last with an other streame
increased by the fals of six waters and more yer it come into the
Darwent.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Seuen.</span>
The most easterlie of these is called Seuen, and riseth (as is
aforesaid) in Blackemoore, from whence it goeth by Sinnington, Murton,
<span class="rightnote"><br />Don or Done.</span>
Normanbie, Newsound, How, and so into the Rie. The second named Don hath
his originall likewise in Blackemoore, and descending by Rasmore, Keldon
<span class="leftnote"><br />Hodgebecke.</span>
and Edston (where it receiueth the Hodgebecke, that commeth by Bernesdale,
Kirkedale, &amp; Welburne) it goeth to Sawlton, and there taketh in first the
<span class="leftnote"><br />Ricoll.</span>
Ricoll, that goeth by Careton, and whereof Ridall (as some think, but
<span class="rightnote">Fesse.</span>
falslie) doth séeme to take the name. Then Fesse, which riseth aboue
Bilisdale chappell, and méeteth with the Rie at the Shaking bridge, from
whence they go togither vnder the Rie bridge, to Riuis abbeie, and
thence (after it hath crossed a becke from the west) through a parke of
the earle of Rutlands to Newton, Muniton, and so to Sawton or Sawlton,
<span class="leftnote"><br />Holbecke.</span>
as I doo find it written. Here also it taketh in the Holbecke brooke,
that commeth thither from by west by Gilling castell, and Stangraue,
from whence it goeth on to Brabie, next into the Seuen, then into the
Rie, and so into the Darwent, which from thence dooth run to Wickham.</p>

<p>Being past Wickham, it méeteth with a water that commeth thereinto from
Grinston to Setterington at southeast, and thence it goeth on to Malton
and Malton (where the prouerbe saith that a bushell of rie and an other
of malt is woorth but sixpence, carie awaie whilest you may, so as you
can kéepe them from running through the sackes) Sutton, Wellam, Furbie,
and Kirkeham, receiuing by the waie one rill on the one side and an
other on the other, whereof this commeth from Burdfall, that other from
Conisthorpe. From Kirkeham it goeth to Cramburne and Owsham bridge
(crossing by the waie an other brooke comming from saint Edwards gore,
by Faston) then to Aldbie, Buttercram (aliàs Butterham) bridge, Stamford
bridge, Kerbie bridge, Sutton, Ellerton, Aughton, Bubwith, Wresill,
Babthorpe, and so into the Ouze, wherewith I finish the description of
Darwent: sauing that I haue to let you vnderstand how Leland heard that
an arme ran some time from the head of Darwent also to Scarborow, till
such time as two hils betwixt which it ran, did shalder and so choke vp
his course.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Fosse.</span>
The Fosse (a slow streame yet able to beare a good vessell) riseth in
Nemore Calaterio, that is, Galters wood or Cawood, among the wooddie
hilles, and in his descent from the higher ground, he leaueth Crake
castell, on his west side: thence he goeth by Marton abbeie, Marton,
Stillington, Farlington, Towthorpe, Erswijc, Huntington, &amp; at Yorke into
<span class="leftnote">Kile.</span>
the Ouze. The Kile riseth flat north at Newborow, from whence it goeth
by Thorneton on the hill, Ruskell parke, Awne, Tollerton, and so into
<span class="leftnote">Swale.</span>
the Ouze about Newton vpon Ouze. The Swale is a right noble riuer, &amp;
march in some places betwéene Richmondshire and Westmerland, it riseth
<span class="page"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[Page 160]</span>
not far from Pendragon castell in the hilles aboue Kirkedale, and from
this towne it goeth to Kelde chappell, Carret house, Crackepot,
<span class="rightnote">Barneie.</span>
Whiteside, and neere vnto Yalen taketh in the Barneie water, which
commeth from the north east. Thence it goeth by Harcaside to Reth (where
<span class="leftnote">Arcleie.</span>
it méeteth with the Arcleie) and so to Flemington, Grinton, Marrike
<span class="rightnote">Holgate.</span>
(taking in the Holgate that commeth from by south: and in the waie to
<span class="leftnote">Mariske becke.</span>
Thorpe, the Mariske becke, or peraduenture Applegarth water, as Leland
calleth it, that descendeth from the north) then to Thorpe, Applegarth,
Richmond, Easbie and Brunton.</p>

<p>Here by north it interteineth two or thrée waters in one chanell, called
<span class="leftnote">Rauenswath.</span>
Rauenswath water, whereof the two furthest doo ioine not farre from the
Dawltons, and so go by Rauenswath, Hartfoorth, Gilling, and at Skebie
méet with the third, comming from Richmond beaconward. By west also of
<span class="leftnote">Rhe.</span>
Brunton, the Swale méeteth with the Rhe, running from Resdale, and being
past Brunton, it goeth to Caterijc bridge beneath Brunton, then to
Ellerton, Kirkebie, Langton parua, Thirtoft, Anderbie stéeple: and
<span class="leftnote">Bedall aliàs Leming.</span>
before it come vnto Gatenbie, it meeteth with the Bedall brooke, aliàs
Lemings becke, that commeth west of Kellirbie, by Cunstable, Burton,
Langthorpe, Bedall, and Leming chappell. From Gattenbie likewise it
<span class="leftnote">Wiske.</span>
goeth to Mawbie, &amp; at Brakenbirie receiueth the Wiske, which is a great
water, rising betwéene two parkes aboue Swanbie in one place, and
southeast of Mountgrace abbeie in another; and after the confluence
which is about Siddlebridge, goeth on betwéene the Rughtons to Appleton,
the Smetons, Birtbie, Hutton Coniers, Danbie, Wijc, Yafford, Warlabie,
and taking in there a rill from Brunton Aluerton, it procéedeth to
Otterington, Newlie, Kirbie Wiske, Newson, and Blackenburie, there
méeting (as I said) with the Swale, that runneth fr&#333; thence by
Skipton bridge, Catton, Topcliffe, and Raniton, and aboue Eldmire
méeteth with sundrie other rilles in one bottome, whereof the
<span class="leftnote">Cawdebec.<br />
Kebecke.</span>
northwesterlie is called Cawdebec: the south easterlie Kebecke, which
ioine est of Thorneton moore, and so go to Thorneton in the stréet,
Kiluington, Thruske, Sowerbie, Grastwijc, and soone after crossing
another growing of the mixture of the Willow, and likewise of the
<span class="leftnote">Cuckwolds becke.</span>
Cuckewold beckes, which ioine aboue Bridforth, and running on till it
come almost at Dawlton, it maketh confluence with the Swale, and go
thence as one with all their samons by Thorneton bridge, Mitton vpon
Swale, and so into the Ouze.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Skell.</span>
The Skell riseth out of the west two miles from Founteines abbeie, and
commeth (as Leland saith) with a faire course by the one side of Rippon,
as the Vre dooth on the other. And on the bankes hereof stood the famous
abbeie called Founteines or Adfontes, so much renowmed for the lustie
monks that sometimes dwelled in the same. It receiueth also the Lauer
<span class="leftnote">Lauer.</span>
water (which riseth thrée miles from Kirbie, and meeteth withall néere
vnto Rippon) and finallie falleth into the Vre, a quarter of a mile
beneath Rippon towne, &amp; almost midwaie betwéene the North and Huicke
bridges.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Nidde.</span>
The Nidde, which the booke of statutes called Nidor (anno 13. Edw. 1.)
and thereto noteth it to be inriched with store of samon, as are also
the Wheof and Aire, riseth among those hilles that lie by west northwest
of Gnarresborow, fiue miles aboue Pakeleie bridge, and going in short
processe of time by Westhouses, Lodgehouses, Woodhall, Newhouses,
Midlesmore, Raunsgill, Cowthouse, Gowthwall, Bureleie, Brimham,
<span class="leftnote">Killingale.</span>
Hampeswale, and soone after méeting with the Killingale becke, it goeth
after the confluence by Bilton parke, Gnaresbridge, Washford, Cathall,
Willesthorpe, Munketon, or Nonmocke, and so into the Ouze, fouretéene
miles beneath Gnaresborow, being increased by the waie with verie few or
no waters of anie countenance. Leland hauing said thus much of the
Nidde, addeth herevnto the names of two other waters, that is to saie,
<span class="leftnote">Couer.<br />
Burne.</span>
the Couer and the Burne, which doo fall likewise into the Vre or Ouze.
But as he saith little of the same, so among all my pamphlets, I can
gather no more of them, than that the first riseth six miles aboue
Couerham by west, and falleth into the Vre, a little beneath Middleham
bridge, which is two miles beneath the towne of Couerham. As for the
Burne, it riseth at More hilles, and falleth into the said riuer a
little beneath Massham bridge. And so much of these two.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Wharfe aliàs Gwerfe.</span>
The Wharffe or Gwerfe ariseth aboue Vghtershaw, from whence it runneth
<span class="page"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[Page 161]</span>
to Beggermons, Rosemill, Hubberham, Backden, Starbotton, Kettlewell,
Cunniston in Kettlewell, and here it meeteth with a rill comming from
Haltongill chappell, by Arnecliffe, and ioining withall northeast of
Kilneseie crag, it passeth ouer by the lower grounds to Girsington, and
receiuing a rill there also from Tresfeld parke, it proceedeth on to
Brunsall bridge. Furthermore at Appletréewijc, it méeteth with a rill
from by north, and thence goeth to Barden towre, Bolton, Beth and
Misleie hall, where it crosseth a rill comming from by west, thence to
Addingham, taking in there also another from by west, and so to Ikeleie,
and receiuing yer long another by north from Denton hall, it hasteth to
Weston Vauasour, Oteleie, and Letheleie, where it taketh in the Padside,
&amp; the Washburne (both in one streame from Lindleie ward) and thence to
Casleie chappell, and there it crosseth one from by north, and another
yer long from by south, and so to Yardwood castell, Kerebie, Woodhall,
Collingham, Linton, Wetherbie, Thorpatch, Newton, Tadcaster, and when it
<span class="leftnote">Cockebecke.</span>
hath receiued the Cockebecke from southwest, that goeth by Barwie,
Aberfoorth, Leadhall, and Grimston, it runneth to Exton, Kirbie Wharfe,
Vskell, Rither, Nunapleton, &amp; so into the Ouze beneath Cawood, a castell
belonging to the archbishop of Yorke, where he vseth oft to lie when he
refresheth himselfe with change of aire and shift of habitation, for the
auoiding of such infection as may otherwise ingender by his long abode
in one place, for want of due purgation and airing of his house.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Air.</span>
The Air or Arre riseth out of a lake or tarne south of Darnbrooke,
wherein (as I heare) is none other fish but red trowt, and perch. Leland
saith it riseth néere vnto Orton in Crauen, wherfore the ods is but
little. It goeth therefore from thence to Mawlam, Hamlith, Kirbie,
Moldale, Calton hall, Areton, and so foorth till it come almost to
<span class="leftnote">Otterburne.</span>
Gargraue, there crossing the Otterburne water on the west, and the
<span class="rightnote">Winterburne.</span>
Winterburne on the north, which at Flasbie receiueth a rill from Helton,
as I heare. Being past Gargraue, our Air goeth on to Eshton, Elswood,
and so foorth on, first receiuing a brooke from southwest (whereof one
branch commeth by Marton, the other by Thorneton, which meete about
Broughton) then another from northeast, that runneth by Skipton castell.
After this confluence it hasteth by manifold windlesses, which caused
thirteene bridges at the last to be ouer the same within a little space,
to Newbiggin, Bradleie, and Kildwijc, by south east whereof it méeteth
<span class="leftnote">Glike.</span>
with one water from Mawsis, and Glusburne or Glukesburne, called Glike;
another likewise a little beneath from Seton, beside two rilles from by
north, after which confluence it runneth by Reddlesden, and ouer against
<span class="leftnote">Lacocke.<br />
Woorth.</span>
this towne the Lacocke and the Woorth doo meet withall in one chanell,
<span class="rightnote">Moreton.</span>
as the Moreton water dooth on the north, although it be somewhat lower.
Thence it goeth to Rishfoorth hall, and so to Bungleie, where it taketh
a rill from Denholme parke to Shipeleie, and there crossing another from
Thorneton, Leuenthorpe, and Bradleie, it goeth to Caluerleie, to
Christall, and so to Léedes, where one water runneth thereinto by north
from Wettlewood, &amp; two other from by south in one chanell, wherof the
first hath two armes, of which the one commeth from Pudseie chappell,
the other from Adwalton, their confluence being made aboue Farnesleie
hall. The other likewise hath two heads, whereof one is aboue Morleie,
the other commeth from Domingleie, and méeting with the first not far
southwest of Leedes, they fall both into the Air, and so run with the
<span class="leftnote">Rodwell.</span>
same to Swillington, and there taking in the Rodwell becke south of the
bridge, it proceedeth to Ollerton, Castleford, Brotherton &amp; Ferribridge,
<span class="leftnote">Went.</span>
there receiuing the Went, a becke from Pontefract or Pomfret, which
riseth of diuerse heads, wherof one is among the cole pits. Thence to
Beall, Berkin, Kellington, middle Hodleseie, Templehirst, Gowldall,
Snath, Rawcliffe, Newland, Armie, and so into the Ouze with an
indifferent course. Of all the riuers in the north, Leland (in so manie
of his bookes as I haue séene) saith least of this. Mine annotations
also are verie slender in the particular waters wherbie it is increased:
wherfore I was compelled of necessitie to conclude euen thus with the
description of the same, and had so left it in déed, if I had not
receiued one other note more to ad vnto it (euen when the leafe was at
the presse) which saith as followeth in maner word for word.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[Page 162]</span></p>

<p>There is a noble water that falleth into Air, whose head (as I take it)
is about Stanford. From whence it goeth to Creston chappell, to
Lingfield, and there about receiuing one rill néere Elfrabright bridge,
<span class="leftnote">Hebden.</span>
and also the Hebden by northwest, it goeth to Brearleie hall, and so
taking in the third by north, it procéedeth on eastward by Sorsbie
bridge chappell (and there a rill from southwest) and so to Coppeleie
hall. Beneath this place I find also that it receiueth one rill from
Hallifax, which riseth from two heads, and two other from southwest, of
which one commeth by Baresland, and Staneland in one chanell, as I read.
So that after this confluence the aforesaid water goeth on toward
Cowford bridge, and as it taketh in two rilles aboue the same on the
north side, so beneath that bridge there falleth into it a pretie arme
increased by sundrie waters c&#333;ming from by south, as from Marsheden
chappell, from Holmesworth chappell, and Kirke Heton, each one growing
of sundrie heads; whereof I would saie more, if I had more intelligence
of their seuerall gates and passages.</p>

<p>But to procéed. From Cowford bridge it runneth to Munfeld, and receiuing
yer long one rill from Leuersage hall, and another from Burshall by
Dewesburie, it goeth on northeast of Thornehull, south of Horbirie
thornes, and thereabout crossing one rill from by south from Woller by
new Milner Dam, and soone after another from northwest, called Chald,
<span class="leftnote">Chald.</span>
rising in the Peke hils, whereon Wakefield standeth, and likewise the
third from southeast, and Waterton hall, it goeth by Warmefield,
Newland, Altoftes, and finallie into the Aire, west of Castelworth, as I
learne. What the name of this riuer should be as yet I heare not, and
therefore no maruell that I doo not set it downe, yet is it certeine
that it is called Chald, after his c&#333;fluence with the Chald, and
finallie Chaldair or Chaldar after it hath ioined with the Air or Ar.
But what is this for his denominations from the head? It shall suffice
therefore thus farre to haue shewed the course thereof: and as for the
name I passe it ouer vntill another time.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Trent.</span>
The Trent is one of the most excellent riuers in the land, not onelie
for store of samon, sturgeon, and sundrie other kinds of delicate fish
wherewith it dooth abound, but also for that it is increased with so
manie waters, as for that onelie cause it may be compared either with
the Ouze or Sauerne, I meane the second Ouze, whose course I haue
latelie described. It riseth of two heads which ioine beneath Norton in
the moore, and from thence goeth to Hilton abbeie, Bucknell church, and
<span class="leftnote">Foulebrooke.</span>
aboue Stoke receiueth in the Foulebrooke water, which commeth thither
from Tunstall, by Shelton, and finallie making a confluence they go to
Hanfleet, where they méet with another on the same side, that descendeth
from Newcastell vnder Line, which Leland taketh to be the verie Trent it
selfe, saieng: that it riseth in the hils aboue Newcastell, as may be
séene by his commentaries.</p>

<p>But to proceed. At Trentham, or not farre from thence, it crosseth a
riueret from northeast, whose name I know not, &amp; thence going to Stone
Aston, Stoke Burston, the Sandons and Weston, a little aboue Shubburne &amp;
Hawood, it receiueth the Sow, a great chanell increased with sundrie
waters, which I will here describe, leauing the Trent at Shubburne,
<span class="leftnote">Sow.</span>
till I come backe againe. The Sow descendeth from the hilles, aboue
Whitemoore chappell, and goeth by Charleton, and Stawne, and beneath
Shalford ioineth with another by northeast that commeth from bishops
Offeleie, Egleshall, Chesbie, Raunton. After this confluence also it
runneth by Bridgeford, Tillington, &amp; Stafford, beneath which towne
<span class="leftnote">Penke.</span>
it crosseth the Penke becke, that riseth aboue Nigleton, &amp; Berwood, &amp;
aboue Penke bridge vniteth it selfe with another comming from Knightleie
ward, by Gnashall church, Eaton: and so going foorth as one, it is not
long yer they fall into Sow, after they haue passed Draiton, Dunstan,
Acton, and Banswich, where loosing their names, they with the Sow &amp; the
Sow with them doo ioine with the Trent, at Shubburne, vpon the
southerlie banke.</p>
<p>
From Shubburne the Trent goeth on to little Harwood (meeting by the waie
one rill at Ousleie bridge, and another south of Riddlesleie) thence by
Hawksberie, Mauestane, Ridware, and so toward Yoxhall; where I must
staie a while to consider of other waters, wherewith I méet in this
<span class="page"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[Page 163]</span>
voiage. Of these therefore the lesser commeth in by south from Farwall,
the other from by west, a faire streame, and increased with two brooks,
whereof the first riseth in Nedewood forrest, northeast of Haggersleie
<span class="leftnote">Blith.</span>
parke, whereinto falleth another west of Hamsteed Ridware, called Blith,
which riseth among the hilles in Whateleie moore, aboue Weston Conie,
and thence going to the same towne, it commeth to Druicote, aliàs
Dracote, Painsleie, Gratwitch, Grimleie, Aldmaston, Hamstéed, Ridware,
and finallie into the Trent, directlie west of Yoxhall, which runneth
also from thence, &amp; leauing kings Bromleie in a parke (as I take it) on
the left hand, and the Blacke water comming from Southton and Lichfield
on the right, goeth streightwaie to Catton, where it méeteth with the
<span class="leftnote">Tame.</span>
Tame, whose course I describe as followeth.</p>

<p>It riseth in Staffordshire (as I remember) not farre from Petteshall,
and goeth foorth by Hamsted, toward Pirihall and Brimichams Aston,
taking in by the waie a rill on each side, whereof the first groweth
through a confluence of two waters, the one of them comming from Tipton,
the other from Aldburie, and so running as one by Wedburie till they
fall into the same. The latter commeth from Woolfhall, and ioineth with
it on the left hand. After this, and when it is past the aforesaid
places, it crosseth in like sort a rill from Smethike ward: thence it
<span class="leftnote">Rhée.</span>
goeth to Yarneton hall, beneath which it méeteth with the Rhée, and
thence through the parke, at Parke hall by Watercote, crossing finallie
<span class="leftnote">Cole.</span>
the Cole, whose head is in the forrest by Kingesnorton wood, and hath
this course, whereof I now giue notice. It riseth (as I said) in the
forrest by Kingesnorton wood, and going by Yareleie and Kingeshirst, it
méeteth betwéene that and the parke, with a water running betwéene
Helmedon and Sheldon.</p>

<p>Thence it passeth on to Coleshull, by east whereof it ioineth with a
<span class="leftnote">Blith.</span>
brooke, mounting southwest of Golihull called Blith, which going by
Henwood and Barston, crosseth on ech side of Temple Balshall, a rill,
whereof one commeth through the Quéenes parke or chase that lieth by
west of Kenelworth, &amp; the other by Kenelworth castell it selfe, from
about Haselie parke. After which confluences it procéedeth in like maner
to Hampton in Arden, and the Packingtons, and so to Coleshull, where it
méeteth with the Cole, that going a little further, vniteth it selfe
<span class="leftnote">Burne.</span>
with the Burne on the one side (whereinto runneth a water comming from
Ansleie on the east) and soone after on the other dooth fall into the
<span class="leftnote">Rhée.</span>
Tame, that which some call the Rhée, a common name to all waters that
mooue and run from their head. For <ins title="Greek: rheô">&#8165;&epsilon;&omega;</ins> in Gréeke is to flow and
run, although in truth it is proper to the sea onelie to flow. Leland
nameth the Brimicham water, whose head (as I heare) is aboue Norffield,
so that his course shuld be by Kingesnorton, Bremicham, Budston hall,
till it fall beneath Yarneton into the Tame it selfe, that runneth after
these confluences on by Lée, Kingesbirie parke, and going by east of
Draiton, Basset parke, to Falkesleie bridge, it méeteth with another
water called Burne, also comming from Hammerwich church, by Chesterford,
Shenton, Thickebrowne, and the north side of Draiton, Basset parke,
wherof I spake before. From hence our Tame runneth on to Tamworth, there
taking in the Anchor by east, whose description I had in this maner
deliuered vnto me.</p>

<p>It riseth aboue Burton, from whence it goeth by Nonneaton, Witherleie
and Atherstone. Yer long also it taketh in a water from northeast, which
commeth by Huglescote, Shapton, Cunston, Twicrosse (vniting it selfe
<span class="leftnote">Anchor.</span>
with a water from Bosworth) Ratcliffe, &amp; so to the Anchor, which after
this confluence passeth by Whittendon, Crindon, Pollesworth, Armington,
Tamworth, &amp; so into Tame, that hasteth to Hopwash, Comberford hall,
Telford, and soone after crossing a rill that riseth short of Swinfield
hall, and commeth by Festirike, it runneth not farre from Croxhall, and
so to Catton, thereabout receiuing his last increase not worthie to be
<span class="leftnote">Mese.</span>
omitted. This brooke is named Mese, and it riseth in the great parke
that lieth betwéene Worthington, and Smethike, from whence also it goeth
by Ashbie de la Souche, Packington, Mesham, and Stretton, and therabout
crossing a rill about Nethersale grange, from Ouersale by east, it
proceedeth by Chilcote, Clifton, Croxall, into the Thame, and both out
of hand into the maine riuer a mile aboue Repton. Leland writing of this
<span class="page"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[Page 164]</span>
riuer (as I earst noted) saith thereof in this wise. Into the Thame also
runneth the Bremicham brooke, which riseth foure or fiue miles about
Bremicham in the Blacke hils in Worcestershire, and goeth into the
aforesaid water a mile aboue Crudworth bridge. Certes (saith he) this
Bremicham is a towne mainteined chieflie by smiths, nailers, cutlers,
edgetoole forgers, lorimers or bitmakers, which haue their iron out of
Stafford and Warwijc shires, and coles also out of the first countie.
Hitherto Leland. Now to resume the Trent, which being growen to some
greatnesse, goeth on to Walton, Drakelow, and there crossing a water
that commeth by Newbold hall, it runneth to Stapenell, Winshull,
Wightmere, and Newton Souch, where it receiueth two chanels within a
short space, to be described apart.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Dou.</span>
The first of these is called the Dou or Doue, it riseth about the thrée
shires méere, and is as it were limes betweene Stafford and Darbishires,
vntill it come at the Trent. Descending therefore from the head, it
goeth by Earlesbooth, Pilsburie grange, Hartington, Wolscot, Eaton,
<span class="leftnote">Manifold.</span>
Hunsington grange, and aboue Thorpe receiueth the Manifold water, so
called, bicause of the sundrie crinckling rills that it receiueth, and
turnagaines that it selfe sheweth before it come at the Dou. Rising
therefore not farre from Axe edge crosse (in the bottome thereby) it
runneth from thence to Longmore, Shéene, Warslow chappell, and Welton.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Hansleie.</span>
Beneath Welton also it taketh in the Hansleie water, that commeth out of
Blackemoore hilles to Watersall, where it falleth into the ground: and
afterward mounting againe is receiued into the Manifold, north of
Throwleie (as I heare) which goeth from thence to Ilam, and aboue Thorpe
dooth cast it selfe into Dou. Hauing therefore met togither after this
maner, the Dou procéedeth on to Maplington, beneath which it crosseth
one water descending from Brassington by Fennie Bentleie, and another
somewhat lower that commeth from Hocston hall by Hognaston and Ashburne,
and then going to Matterfield, Narburie, Ellaston, Rawston Rowcester, it
<span class="leftnote">Churne.</span>
meeteth with the Churne, euen here to be described before I go anie
further. It riseth a good waie aboue Delacrasse abbie, and comming
<span class="leftnote">Dunsmere.</span>
thither by Hellesbie wood, it taketh in the Dunsmere, betwéene
Harracrasse and Leike.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Yendor.</span>
Thence it goeth to the Walgrange, and a little beneath receiueth the
Yendor that commeth from aboue Harton, thence to Cheddleton, and hauing
<span class="rightnote"><br />Aula Canuti.<br />
Ashenhirst.</span>
crossed the Ashenhirst brooke aboue Cnutes hall, it runneth by Ypston,
Froghall, Below hill, Alton castell, Préestwood, and at Rowcester
falleth into the Dou, which yer long also receiueth a rill from Crowsden,
<span class="leftnote">Teine.</span>
and then going to Eton méeteth first with the Teine that commeth thither
from each side of Chedleie by Teinetowne, Bramhirst and Stranehill.
<span class="leftnote">Vttoxeter or Vncester.</span>
Secondlie with the Vncester or Vttoxeter water, and then going on to
Merchington, Sidberie, Cawlton, it crosseth a brooke from Sidmister
college, by Saperton. From this confluence in like sort it passeth
foorth to Tilberie castell, Marston, and at Edgerton méeteth with the
water that commeth from Yeldersleie by Longford (whereinto runneth
another that commeth from Hollington) and so to Hilton. These waters
being thus ioined, and manie ends brought into one, the Dou it selfe
falleth yer long likewise into the Trent, aboue Newton Souch. So that
the maine riuer being thus inlarged, goeth onwards with his course, and
betwéene Willington and Repton meeteth with two waters on sundrie sides,
whereof that which falleth in by Willington, riseth néere Dawberie Lies,
and runneth by Trusselie and Ashe: the other that entereth aboue Repton,
descendeth from Hartesburne, so that the Trent being past these, hasteth
to Twiford, Inglebie, Staunton, Weston, Newton, and Aston, yer long also
<span class="leftnote">Darwent.</span>
méeting with the Darwent; next of all to be dispatched. The Darwent, or
(to vse the verie British word) Dowr gwine (but in Latine Fluuius
Dereuantanus) riseth plaine west, néere vnto the edge of Darbishire,
aboue Blackwell a market towne, and from the head runneth to the New
chappell, within a few miles after it be risen. From hence moreouer it
goeth by Howden house, Darwent chappell, Yorkeshire bridge, and at
<span class="leftnote">Neue.</span>
Witham bridge dooth crosse the Neue or Nouius that commeth from Newstole
hill, by Netherburgh, Hope (crossing there one rill from Castelton,
another from Bradwell, and the third at Hathersage, from Stonie ridge
hill) and so goeth on to Padleie, Stockehall, receiuing a rill by the
<span class="page"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[Page 165]</span>
waie from by west, to Stonie Middleton, and Baslow, and hauing here
<span class="rightnote">Burbroke.</span>
taken in the Burbrooke on the one side, and another from Halsop on the
other, it goeth to Chatworth and to Rowseleie, where it is increased
with the Wie comming from by west, and also a rill on the east, a little
higher. But I will describe the Wie before I go anie further.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Wie.</span>
The Wie riseth aboue Buxston well, and there is increased with the
<span class="rightnote">Hawkeshow.<br />
Wile.</span>
Hawkeshow, and the Wile brooke, whose heads are also further distant
from the edge of Darbishire than that of Wie, and races somwhat longer,
though neither of them be worthie to be accompted long. For the Wile,
hauing two heads, the one of them is not farre aboue the place where
Wilebecke abbeie stood, the other is further off by west, about
Wilebecke towne: and finallie ioining in one they runne to Cuckneie
village, where receiuing a becke that commeth downe from by west, it
holdeth on two miles further, there taking in the second rill, and so
<span class="leftnote">Rufford aliàs Manbecke.</span>
resort to Rufford, or the Manbecke. Vnto this also doo other two rills
repaire, wherof the one goeth through and the other hard by Maunsfield,
of which two also this latter riseth west about foure miles, and runneth
foorth to Clipston (three miles lower) and so likewise to Rufford,
whereof I will speake hereafter. In the meane time to returne againe to
the Wie. From Buxston well, it runneth to Staddon, Cowdale, Cowlow, New
medow, Milhouses, Bankewell, and Haddon hall, beneath which it receiueth
<span class="leftnote">Lathkell.<br />
Bradford.</span>
the Lath kell, that runneth by Ouerhaddon, and the Bradford, both in one
bottome after they be ioined in one at Alport. And this is the first
great water that our Darwent dooth méet withall. Being therefore past
the Rowsleies, the said Darwent goeth to Stancliffe, Darleie in the
peake, Wensleie, Smitterton hall, and at Matlocke taketh in a rill by
northeast, as it dooth another at Crumford that goeth by Boteshall.</p>

<p>From Mattocke, it procéedeth to Watston, or Watsond, Well bridge,
<span class="leftnote">Amber.</span>
Alderwash, and ioineth with another streame called Amber comming in from
by north by Amber bridge, whose description shall insue in this wise, as
I find it. The head of Amber is aboue Edleston hall, or (as Leland
saith) est of Chesterfield, and comming from thence by Middleton to
Ogston hall, it taketh withall another brooke, descending from Hardwijc
wood, by Alton and Streton. Thence it goeth to Higham, Brackenfield, and
aboue Dale bridge meeteth with a brooke running from Hucknalward to
<span class="leftnote">Moreton.</span>
Shireland parke side, there crossing the Moreton becke, and so to
Alferton, except I name it wrong. From Dale bridge it goeth by Wingfeld,
to Hedge, Fritchlin, and so into Darwent, taking the water withall that
descendeth from Swanswijc by Pentridge, as Leland doth remember. From
this confluence likewise it runneth to Belper, where it méeteth with a
rill comming from Morleie parke: thence to Makenie, and at Duffeld,
<span class="leftnote">Eglesburne.</span>
receiueth the Eglesburne, which ariseth about Wirkesworth or Oresworth,
but in the same parish out of a rocke, and commeth in by Turnedich. From
Duffeld, it passeth to Bradsall, Darleie abbeie, and at Darbie taketh in
a rill comming from Mirkaston by Weston vnderwood, Kidleston and Merton.
If a man should say that Darwent riuer giueth name to Darbie towne, he
should not well know how euerie one would take it, and peraduenture
therby he might happen to offend some. In the meane time I beleeue it,
let other iudge as pleaseth them, sith my coniecture can preiudice none.
To proceed therefore. From Darbie it runneth on by Aluaston, Ambaston,
the Welles, and so into Trent, which goeth from hence to Sawleie, and
<span class="leftnote">Sora, or Surus.</span>
north of Thrumpton taketh in the Sore, a faire streame, and not worthie
to be ouerpassed.</p>

<p>It riseth in Leicestershire aboue Wigton, and thence goeth to
Sharneford, Sapcote, and beneath Staunton taketh in a rill that commeth
by Dounton and Broughton Astleie. Thence to Marleborow, and before it
come to Eston, crosseth another on the same side (descending by Burton,
Glen, Winstow, Kilbie and Blabie) then to Leircester towne, Belgraue,
Burstall, Wanlip; and yer it come at Cussington or Cositon, crosseth the
<span class="leftnote">Eie.</span>
Eie, which riseth néere Occam aboue Bramston, going by Knawstow, Somerbie, Pickwell,
<span class="rightnote"><em>Leland</em> calleth one of these rilles Croco.</span>
Whitesonden; and beneath (a litle) receiueth a rill on the right hand,
from Coldnorton. Thence to Stapleford, &amp; soone after crossing a brooke
from aboue Sproxton, Coson, Garthorpe and Sarbie, it runneth to
Wiuerbie, Brentingbie; and yer it come at Milton, meeteth with two other
<span class="page"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[Page 166]</span>
small rilles, from the right hand whereof one commeth from about
Caldwell by Thorpe Arnold, and Waltham in the Would; the other from
Skaleford ward, and from Melton goeth by Sisonbie, there méeting with
another from northeast ouer against Kirbie Hellars, after which time the
<span class="leftnote">Warke, Vrke, or Wreke.</span>
name of Eie is changed into Warke or Vrke, and so continueth vntill it
come at the Soure. From hence also it goeth to Asterbie, Radgale, Habie,
Trussington, Ratcliffe; and soone after crosseth sundrie waters not
verie farre in sunder, whereof one commeth from Oueston, by Twiford,
Ashbie, and Gadesbie; another from Losebie, by Baggraue, and Crawston,
and ioining with the first at Ouennihow, it is not long yer they fall
into the Warke. The second runneth from Engarsbie, by Barkeleie, and
Sison. But the third and greatest of the thrée, is a chanell increased
with thrée waters, whereof one commeth from Norton by Burton, Kilbie,
Foston and Blabie, the other from Dounton by Broughton and Astleie, and
meéting with the third from Sapcoth, and stonie Staunton, they run
togither by Narborow, and soone after ioining aboue Elston, with the
first of the thrée, they go as one by Elston to Leircester, Belgraue,
Wanlip, and aboue Cussington doo fall into the Warke, and soone after
into the Soure. The Soure in like sort going from thence to mount
Sorrell, &amp; taking in another brooke southwest from Leircester forrest,
by Glenfield, Austie, Thurcaston and Rodelie, ioineth with the Soure,
which goeth from thence to mount Sorrell, and Quarendon (where it taketh
in a water comming from Charnewood forrest, and goeth by Bradegate and
Swithland) and then procéedeth to Cotes, Lughborow and Stanford, there
also taking in one rill out of Nottinghamshire by northeast; and soone
after another from southwest, comming from Braceden to Shepesheued,
Garrington, &amp; Dighlie grange, and likewise the third from Worthington,
by Disworth, long Whitton, and Wathorne. Finallie, after these
confluences, it hasteth to Sutton, Kingston, and Ratcliffe, and so into
the Trent.</p>

<p>These things being thus brought togither, and we now resuming the
discourse of the same riuer, it dooth after his méeting with the Soure,
<span class="leftnote">Erwash.</span>
procéed withall to Barton, where it taketh in the Erwash, which riseth
about Kirbie, and thence goeth to Selston, Wansbie, Codnor castell,
Estwood, and crossing a water from Beuall, runneth to Coshall, Trowell
(and there taking in another rill comming from Henor by Shipleie) it
proceedeth on to Stapleford, long Eaton, and so into the Trent. This
being doone it goeth to Clifton, and yer it come at Wilford, it méeteth
with a brooke that passeth from Staunton by Bonnie and Rodington, and
thence to Notingham, where it crosseth the Line, which riseth aboue
Newsted; and passing by Papplewijc, Hucknall, Bafford, Radford and
Linton, next of all to Thorpe &amp; Farmdon, where it brancheth and maketh
an Iland, and into the smaller of them goeth a brooke from Beuer
castell, which rising betweene east Well and Eaton in Leircester is
<span class="leftnote">Dene.</span>
called the Dene, and from thence runneth by Bramston to Knipton, &amp;
beneath Knipton méeteth with a brooke that commeth by west of Croxston,
and thence holdeth on with his course, betwéene Willesthorpe and Beuer
castell aforesaid, and so to Bottesworth, Normanton, Killington,
<span class="leftnote">Snite.</span>
Shilton, there receiuing the Snite from by south (whose head is néere
Clauston, &amp; course from thence by Hickling, Langer, Whalton, Orston, and
Flareborow) and yer long another comming from Bingham, and Sibthorpe.
Thence our Trent runneth to Coxam, Hawton, Newarke castell, and so to
Winthorpe, where the branches are reunited, and thence going on by Holme
to Cromwell (and soone after taking in a brooke comming from Bilsthorpe,
by Kersall, Cawnton, Norwell and Willowbie) to Carlton, and to Sutton,
there making a litle Ile, then to Grinton, where it toucheth a streame
on ech side, whereof one commeth from Morehouse by Weston &amp; Gresthorpe,
another from Langthorpe, by Collingham, and Bosthorpe. From hence
likewise it passeth to Clifton, Newton, Kettlethorpe, Torkeseie, Knash,
Gainsborow, Waltrith, Stockwith; and leauing Axholme on the left hand,
it taketh withall Hogdike water out of the Ile, and so goeth foorth to
Wildsworth, Eastferrie, Frusworth, Burringham, Gummeis, Hixburgh,
Burton, Walcote, and at Ankerburie into the Humber, receiuing the swift
Doue by the waie, which for his noblenesse is not to be ouerpassed,
especiallie for that Anno 1536 Hen. 8, 28, it was (by Gods prouidence) a
<span class="page"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[Page 167]</span>
staie of great bloudshed like to haue fallen out betwéene the kings side
and the rebelles of the north, in a quarrell about religion. For the
<span class="rightnote">A miracle.</span>
night before the battle should haue béene stricken, and without anie
apparent cause (a little showre of raine excepted farre vnpossible vpon
such a sudden to haue made so great a water) the said riuer arose so
high, &amp; ran with such vehemencie, that on the morow the armies could not
ioine to trie &amp; fight it out: after which a pacification insued, and
those countries were left in quiet. Secondlie, the description hereof is
not to be ouerpassed, bicause of the fine grasse which groweth vpon the
banks thereof, which is so fine and batable, that there goeth a prouerbe
vpon the same; so oft as a man will commend his pasture, to say that
there is no better féed on Doue banke: that maketh it also the more
famous.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Doue.</span>
The Doue therefore riseth in Yorkeshire among the Peke hilles, and
hauing receiued a water comming by Ingbirchworth (where the colour
thereof is verie blacke) it goeth to Pennistone, which is foure miles
from the head: then by Oxspring to Thurgoland, and soone after (ioining
by the waie with the Midhop water, that runneth by Midhop chappell, and
Hondshelfe) it méeteth with another comming from Bowsterston chappell.
Then goeth it by Waddesleie wood to Waddesleie bridge, and at Aluerton
receiueth the Bradfeld water. Then passeth it to Crokes, and so to
Sheffeld castell (by east whereof it receiueth a brooke from by south
that commeth through Sheffeld parke.) Thence it procéedeth to Westford
<span class="leftnote">Cowleie.</span>
bridge, Briksie bridge; and southwest of Timsleie receiueth the Cowleie
streame that runneth by Ecclefield. Next of all it goeth to Rotheram,
<span class="leftnote">Rother.</span>
where it méeteth with the Rother, a goodlie water, whose head is in
Darbieshire about Pilsleie, from whence it goeth vnder the name of
Doleie, till it come at Rotheram, by north Winfield church, Wingerworth,
and Foreland hall, twelue miles from Rotheram, to Chesterford, where it
<span class="rightnote">Iber.<br />
Brampton.</span>
méeteth with the Iber, and Brampton water that commeth by Holme hall,
both in one chanell. Thence it runneth to Topton castell, and yer long
crossing one water comming from Dronefeld by Whittington on the one
side, and the second from aboue Birmington on the other, it goeth
through Stalie parke, and soone after méeteth with the Crawleie becke,
whereof I find this note.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Crawleie.</span>
The Crawleie riseth not farre from Hardwijc, and going by Stanesbie and
Woodhouse, it receiueth aboue Netherthorpe, one water on the one side
comming from the Old parke, and another from Barlborow hill on the
other, that runneth not farre from Woodthorpe. After this confluence
likewise they run as one into the Rother, which hasteth from thence to
Eckington (there crossing a rill that runneth by Birleie hill) and so to
<span class="leftnote">Gunno.</span>
Kilmarsh, in the confines of Darbieshire, where it taketh in the Gunno
from by east. Thence to Boughton, vniting it selfe therabout with
<span class="leftnote">Mesebrooke.</span>
another by west from Gledles, called Mesebrooke, which diuideth
Yorkeshire from Darbieshire, and so runneth to Treton, Whiston, there
taking in a rill from Aston, and so to Rotheram, where it méeteth with
the Doue, and from whence our Doue (yéelding plentie of samon all the
waie as it passeth) hasteth to Aldwarke, Swaiton, Mexburge, there taking
in the Darne, which I will next describe, and staie with the Doue,
vntill I haue finished the same. It riseth at Combworth, and so commeth
about by Bretton hall, to Darton ward, where it crosseth a water that
runneth from Gonthwake hall, by Cawthorne vnited of two heads. From
hence it goeth to Burton grange, then to Drax, where it toucheth with a
water from southwest, &amp; then goeth to Derfield and Goldthorpe: but yer
it come to Sprotborow, it vniteth it selfe with a faire riuer, increased
by diuerse waters, before it come at the Doue, &amp; whereinto it falleth
(as I heare) northeast of Mexburgh. After this confluence likewise the
Doue goeth by Sprotborow, to Warnesworth, Doncaster, Wheatleie, (there
<span class="leftnote">Hampall.</span>
méeting with the Hampall créeke on the northeast side, which riseth east
of Kirbie) thence to Sandall, Kirke Sandall, Branwith ferrie, Stanford,
Fishlake, and so to Thuorne or Thurne, where it crosseth the Idle (whose
description followeth) and finallie into Trent, and so into the Humber.</p>

<p>But before I deale with the description of the Idle, I will adde
somewhat of the Rume, a faire water. For though the description thereof
be not so exactlie deliuered me as I looked for; yet such as it is I will
<span class="page"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[Page 168]</span>
set downe, conferring it with Lelands booke, and helping their defect so
much as to me is possible. It riseth by south of Maunsfield, fiue miles
from Rumford abbeie, and when the streame commeth neere the abbeie, it
casteth it selfe abroad and maketh a faire lake. After this it commeth
<span class="rightnote">Budbie.</span>
againe into a narrow channell, and so goeth on to Rumford village,
<span class="rightnote"><br />Gerberton.</span>
carrieng the Budbie and the Gerberton waters withall. From thence, and
with a méetlie long course, it goeth to Bawtrie or Vautrie, a market
towne in Nottinghamshire, fiue miles from Doncaster, and so into the
<span class="leftnote">Girt.</span>
Trent. Beneath Rumford also commeth in the Girt, which goeth vnto
Southwell milles, and so into the Trent. Now as concerning our Idle.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Idle.</span>
The Idle, which some call Brier streame, riseth at Sutton in Ashfield,
from whence it runneth to Maunsfield, Clipston &amp; Allerton, where it
taketh in a water that riseth in the forrest, one mile north of
Bledworth, and runneth on by Rughford abbeie, till it come to Allerton.
<span class="leftnote">Manbecke.</span>
The forresters call this Manbecke, whereof Leland also speaketh, who
describeth it in this maner. Manbrooke riseth somewhere about Linthirst
wood, from whence it goeth to Blisthorpe, and so to Allerton. But to
procéed. The Idle hauing taken in the Manbecke, it runneth to
Bothomsall, by Boughton, &amp; Perlethorpe: but yer it come there, it
<span class="leftnote">Meding becke.</span>
méeteth the Meding Maiden, or Midding brooke, which rising about
Teuersall, goeth to Pleasleie, Nettleworth, Sawcan, Warsop, Budleie,
Thursbie, Bothomsall, and so into the Idle. After this it proceedeth to
Houghton, west Draiton, but yer it touch at Graunston or Gaunston, it
<span class="leftnote">Wilie.</span>
taketh in the Wilie, which commeth from Clowne, to Creswell, Holbecke,
Woodhouse, Wilebecke, Normenton, Elsleie, Graunston, and so into the
Idle. Being thus increased, the Idle runneth on to Idleton, Ordsall,
Retford, Bollam, Tilneie, Matterseie abbeie, and so to Bawtrie, where it
méeteth another from the shire Okes, that riseth aboue Geitford, passeth
<span class="leftnote">Blith.</span>
on to Worksop (or Radfurth) Osberton, Bilbie, and Blith, there vniting
it selfe with thrée rilles in one bottome, whereof one commeth from
Waldingwell to Careleton, and so thorough a parke to Blith towne,
another from by west Furbecke thrée miles, and so to Blith: but the
third out of the White water néere to Blith, and there being vnited they
passe on to Scrobie, and so into the Idle.</p>

<p>From hence it runneth on to Missen, to Sadlers bridge, and next of all
<span class="leftnote">Sandbecke.</span>
to Santoft, where it méeteth with the Sandbecke, which rising not farre
from Sandbecke towne, passeth by Tickhill, Rosington bridge, Brampton,
Rilholme, Lindholme, and one mile south of Santoft into the Idle water,
which runneth from thence to Thorne, where it méeteth with the Doue, and
so with it to Crowleie. Finallie, inuironing the Ile of Axeholme, it
goeth vnto Garthorpe, Focorbie, &amp; so into the Trent. Leland writing of
the Wilie, Wile, or Gwilie (as some write it) saith thus therof. The
Wile hath two heads, whereof one is not farre aboue the place where
Wilbecke abbeie stood; the other riseth further off by west aboue
Welbecke or Wilebecke towne: finallie ioining in one, they runne to
Cuckeneie village, where crossing a becke that commeth in from by west,
it holdeth on two miles further, there taking in the second rill, and so
resort to Rufford. To this riuer likewise (saith he) doo two other
waters repaire, whereof the one goeth hard by Maunsfield (rising foure
miles from thence by west) and then commeth thrée miles lower to
Rufford; the other (so far as I remember) goeth quite through the towne.</p>

<h3><a name="d1-cap16" id="d1-cap16"></a>
<small>OF SUCH FALLES OF WATERS AS IOINE WITH THE SEA, BETWEENE HUMBER AND <br />THE THAMES.</small><br />

CHAP. XVI.</h3>

<p>Hauing in this maner described the Ouze, and such riuers as fall into
the same: now it resteth that I procéed in my voiage toward the Thames,
according to my former order. Being therefore come againe into the maine
sea, I find no water of anie countenance or course (to my remembrance)
<span class="leftnote">Ancolme.</span>
till I come vnto the Ancolme a goodlie water, which riseth east of
<span class="page"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[Page 169]</span>
Mercate Rasing, and from thence goeth by middle Rasing. Then receiuing a
short rill from by south, it runneth on vnder two bridges, by the waie,
till it come to Wingall, northeast; where also it méeteth with another
brooke, from Vsselbie that commeth thither by Vresbie, goeth by Cadneie
(taking in the two rilles in one bottome, that descend from Howsham, and
north Leiseie) and thence to Newsted, Glanford, Wardeleie, Thorneham,
Applebie, Horslow, north Ferribie, and so into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Kilis.</span>
Being past Ancolme, we go about the Nesse, and so to the fall of the
water which commeth from Kelebie, by Cotham abbeie, Nersham abbeie,
Thorneton, and leauing Coxhill by west, it falleth into the Ocean. The
next is the fall of another brooke comming from Fleting, all alongst by
Stallingburne. Then crossed we Grimsbie gullet, which issuing aboue
Erebie commeth to Lasebie, the two Cotes, and then into the sea. After
this we passed by another portlet, whose backwater descendeth from
Balesbie by Ashbie, Briggesleie, Wath, and Towneie, and finallie to the
next issue, before we come at Saltflete, which branching at the last,
leaueth a prettie Iland wherein Comsholme village standeth. This water
riseth short (as I heare) of Tathewell, from whence it goeth to Rathbie,
Hallington, Essington, Lowth, Kidirington, Auingham, and then branching
aboue north Somerton, one arme méeteth with the sea, by Grauethorpe, the
other by north of Somercote.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Saltflete.</span>
Saltflete water hath but a short course: for rising among the
Cockeringtons, it commeth to the sea, at Saltflete hauen: howbeit the
next vnto it is of a longer race, for it riseth (as I take it) at
Cawthorpe paroch, and descendeth by Legburne, the Carletons, the west
middle and east Saltfletes, and so into the Ocean. The water that riseth
aboue Ormesbie and Dribie, goeth to Cawsbie, Swabie abbeie, Clathorpe,
Belew, Tattle, Witherne, Stane, and northeast of Thetilthorpe into the
maine sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Maplethorpe</span>
Maplethorpe water riseth at Tharesthorpe, and going by Markeleie,
Folethorpe, and Truthorpe, it is not long yer it méet with the Germane
Ocean. Then come we to the issue that commeth from aboue the Hotoft, and
thence to Mumbie chappell, whither the water comming from Claxbie,
Willowbie, and Slouthbie (and whereinto another rill falleth) dooth
runne, as there to doo homage vnto their lord and souereigne. As for
Ingold mill créeke, I passe it ouer, and come straight to another water,
descending from Burge by Skegnes. From hence I go to the issue of a
faire brooke, which (as I heare) dooth rise at Tetford, and thence goeth
by Somerbie, Bagenderbie, Ashwardbie, Sawsthorpe, Partneie, Ashbie, the
Stepings, Thorpe croft, and so into the sea. As for Wainflete water, it
commeth from the east sea, and goeth betwéene S. Maries &amp; Alhallowes by
Wainflete towne, and treading the path of his predecessors, emptieth his
chanell to the maintenance of the sea.</p>

<p>Now come I to the course of the Witham, a famous riuer, whereof goeth
the biword, frequented of old, and also of Ancolme, which I before
described:</p>

<p class="ind1">Ancolme ele, and Witham pike,<br />
Search all England and find not the like.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Lindis, Witham, Rhe.</span>
Leland calleth it Lindis, diuerse the Rhe, and I haue read all these
names my selfe: and thereto that the Lincolneshire men were called in
old time Coritani, and their head citie Lindus, Lindon, or Linodunum, in
which region also Ptolomie placeth Rage, which some take to be
Notingham, except my memorie doo faile me. It riseth among the Wickhams,
in the edge of Lincolnshire, and (as I take it) in south-Wickham paroch,
from whence it goeth to Colsterworth, Easton, Kirkestoke Paunton, and
Paunton Houghton, and at Grantham taketh in a rill from by southwest, as
I heare. From Grantham it runneth to Man, Thorpe, Bolton, and Barneston,
where crossing a becke from northeast, it procéedeth further southwest
ward by Mereston, toward Faston (there also taking in a brooke that
riseth about Denton, and goeth by Sidbrooke) it hasteth to Dodington,
Clapale, Barmebie, Beckingham, Stapleford, Bassingham, Thursbie, and
beneath Amburgh crosseth a water that commeth from Stogilthorpe by
Somerton castell.</p>

<p>After this confluence also, our Witham goeth still foorth on his waie to
<span class="page"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[Page 170]</span>
the Hickhams, Boltham, Bracebridge, and Lincolne it selfe, for which the
Normans write Nicholl by transposition of the letters, or (as I may
better saie) corruption of the word. But yer it come there, it maketh
certeine pooles (whereof one is called Swan poole) and soone after
diuiding it selfe into armes, they run both thorough the lower part of
Lincolne, each of them hauing a bridge of stone ouer it, thereby to
passe through the principall stréet: and as the bigger arme is well able
to beare their fisher botes, so the lesser is not without his seuerall
<span class="leftnote">Fosse dike.</span>
commodities. At Lincolne also this noble riuer méeteth with the Fosse
dike, whereby in great floods vessels may come from the Trents side to
Lincolne. For betweene Torkseie, where it beginneth, and Lincolne citie,
where it endeth, are not aboue seuen miles, as Leland hath remembred.
Bishop Atwater began to clense this ditch, thinking to bring great
vessels from Trent to Lincolne in his time: but sith he died before it
was performed, there hath no man beene since so well minded as to
prosecute his purpose. The course moreouer of this our streame
following, from Lincolne to Boston is fiftie miles by water: but if you
mind to ferrie, you shall haue but 24. For there are foure common places
where men are ferried ouer; as Short ferrie, fiue miles from Lincolne,
Tatersall ferrie, eight miles from Short ferrie, Dogdike ferrie a mile,
Langreth ferrie fiue miles, and so manie finallie to Boston.</p>

<p>But to go forward with the course of Lindis (whereof the whole prouince
hath béene called Lindeseie) when it is past Lincolne, it goeth by
Shepewash, Wassingburg, Fiskerton, and soone after taketh in sundrie
riuers in one chanell, whereby his greatnesse is verie much increased.
From this confluence it goeth to Bardolfe, and there receíuing a rill
(descending from betweene Sotbie and Randbie, and going by Harton) it
slideth foorth by Tupham to Tatersall castell, taking vp there in like
sort thrée small rills by the waie, whereof I haue small notice as yet:
and therefore I referre them vnto a further consideration to be had of
them hereafter, if it shall please God that I may liue to haue the
filing of these rude pamphlets yet once againe, &amp; somewhat more leasure
to peruse them than at this time is granted. Finallie, being past
Tatersall, and Dogdike ferrie, the Witham goeth toward Boston, &amp; thence
into the sea. Thus haue I brieflie dispatched this noble riuer Witham.
But hauing another note deliuered me thereof from a fréend, I will yéeld
so farre vnto his gratification, that I will remember his trauell here,
and set downe also what he hath written thereof, although the riuer be
sufficientlie described alredie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Witham.</span>
Into Witham therefore from by north, and seuen miles beneath Lincolne,
<span class="rightnote">Hake.</span>
there falleth a faire water, the head whereof is at Hakethorne, from
whence it goeth by Hanworth, Snarford, Resbie, Stainton, and at
Bullington méeteth with a water on ech side, whereof one commeth from
Haiton and Turrington, the other from Sudbrooke, and likewise beneath
Birlings with the third comming from Barkeworth by Stansted, and ioining
all in one, soone after it is not long yer it fall into the chanell of
Witham, and so are neuer more heard of. There is also a brooke by
southwest, that commeth from Kirbie to Cateleie, Billingams, and the
<span class="rightnote">Bane.</span>
Ferrie. At Tatersall it méeteth with the Bane, which riseth aboue Burgh,
and néere vnto Ludford goeth downe to Dunnington, Stanigod, Hemmingsbie,
Bamburgh, Fillington, Horne castell, (where it crosseth a rill from
Belchworth) Thornton, Marton, Halton, Kirkebie, Comsbie, Tatersall, and
so to Dogdike ferrie.</p>
<p>
Aboue Boston likewise it taketh in a water comming from Lusebie by
Bolingbrooke, Stickeford, Stickneie, Sibbeseie and Hildrike. And to
Boston towne it selfe doo finallie come sundrie brookes in one chanell,
called Hammond becke, which rising at Donesbie, runneth on to
Wrightbold, where it casteth one arme into Holiwell water. Thence it
hasteth toward Dunnington, receiuing four brookes by the waie, whereof
the first commeth from Milthorpe, the second from Fokingham, called
<span class="leftnote">Bollingborow.<br />
Sempringham.</span>
Bollingborow, or (after some, I wote not vpon what occasion) Sempringham
water, the third from Bridge end, the fourth from Sempringham, and
afterwards the maine streame is found to run by Kirton holme, and so
into the Witham. Into the Wiland likewise falleth the Holiwell, which
riseth of a spring that runneth toward the east from Haliwell to Onebie,
Esonden, Gretford, and so to Catbridge, where it receiueth another
rising at Witham and west of Manthorpe, and the second comming from Laund,
<span class="page"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[Page 171]</span>
and so run from thence togither to Willesthorpe and Catbridge, and then
into the Haliwell, which after these confluences goeth to Tetford and
Eastcote, where it meeteth with a draine, comming from Bourne, and so
through the fennes to Pinchbecke, Surfleet, and Fosdike, where it
méeteth with the Welland, in the mouth of the Wash, as I haue noted vnto
you.</p>
<p>
Hauing thus set foorth the riuers that fall into the Witham, now come we
<span class="leftnote">Wiland.</span>
to the Wiland or Welland, wherevnto we repaire after we be past Boston,
as drawing by litle and litle toward the Girwies, which inhabit in the
fennes (for Gir in the old Saxon speach dooth signifie déepe fennes and
marishes) and these beginning at Peterborow eastward, extend themselues
by the space of thrée score miles &amp; more, as Hugh of Peterborow writeth.
This streame riseth about Sibbertoft, and running betwéene Bosworth and
Howthorpe, it goeth to Féedingworth, Merson, Bubberham, Trussell,
<span class="leftnote">Braie.</span>
Herborow (receiuing there the Braie, which commeth from Braiebrooke
castell) to Bowton, Weston, Wiland, Ashleie, Medburne, Rokingham, and
Cawcot, where a riueret called little Eie méeteth withall, comming from
east Norton by Alexstone, Stocke, Fasten, and Drie stocke. From Cawcot
it goeth to Gritto, Harringworth, Seton, Wauerlie, Duddington, Collie
<span class="leftnote">Warke.</span>
Weston, Eston, and there ioineth with the third called Warke, not far
from Ketton, which commeth from Lie by Preston, Wing, Lindon, Luffenham,
<span class="leftnote">Brooke water.</span>
&amp;c. Thence it goeth on by Tinwell, to Stanford (crossing the Brooke
<span class="rightnote">Whitnell.</span>
water, and Whitnelbecke, both in one bottome) and from Stanford by
Talington, Mareie, to Mercate Deeping, Crowland (where it almost meeteth
with the Auon) then to Spalding, Whapland, and so into the sea.</p>
<p>
Leland writing of this Wiland, addeth these words which I will not omit,
sith in mine opinion they are worthie to be noted, for better
consideration to be had in the said water and his course. The Wiland
(saith he) going by Crowland, at Newdrene diuideth it selfe into two
<span class="leftnote">Newdrene.</span>
branches, of which one goeth vp to Spalding called Newdrene, and so into
<span class="rightnote">South.</span>
the sea at Fossedike Stow: the other named the South into Wisbech. This
latter also parteth it selfe two miles from Crowland, &amp; sendeth a rill
<span class="leftnote">Writhlake.</span>
called Writhlake by Thorneie, where it méeteth with an arme of the Nene,
that commeth from Peterborow, and holdeth course with the broad streame,
till it be come to Murho, six miles from Wisbech, where it falleth into
the South.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Shéepees eie.</span>
Out of the South in like sort falleth another arme called Sheepes eie
and at Hopelode (which is fouretéene miles from Lin) did fall into the
sea. But now the course of that streame is ceased, wherevpon the
inhabitants susteine manie grieuous flouds, bicause the mouth is
stanched, by which it had accesse before into the sea. Hitherto Leland.
Of the course of this riuer also from Stanford, I note this furthermore
out of another writing in my time. Being past Stanton (saith he) it
goeth by Burghleie, Vffington, Tallington, Mareie, Déeping, east
Deeping, and comming to Waldram hall, it brancheth into two armes,
whereof that which goeth to Singlesole, receiueth the Nene out of
Cambridgeshire, and then going by Dowesdale, Trekenhole, and winding at
last to Wisbech, it goeth by Liuerington, saint Maries, and so into the
sea. The other arme hasteth to Crowland, Clowthouse, Bretherhouse,
Pikale, Cowbecke and Spalding. Here also it receiueth the Baston dreane,
Longtoft dreane, Déeping dreane, and thence goeth by Wickham into the
sea, taking withall on the right hand sundrie other dreanes. And thus
farre he.</p>
<p>
Next of all, when we are past these, we come to another fall of water
into the Wash, which descendeth directlie from Whaplade dreane to
Whaplade towne in Holland: but bicause it is a water of small
importance, I passe from thence, as hasting to the Nene, of both the
more noble riuer: and about the middest thereof in place is a certeine
swallow, so déepe and so cold in the middest of summer, that no man dare
diue to the bottome thereof for coldnesse, and yet for all that in
winter neuer found to haue béene touched with frost, much lesse to be
<span class="leftnote">Auon.</span>
couered with ise. The next therefore to be described is the Auon,
<span class="rightnote">Nene.</span>
otherwise called Nene, which the said author describeth after this
maner. The Nene beginneth foure miles aboue Northampton in Nene méere,
where it riseth out of two heads, which ioine about Northampton. Of this
<span class="page"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[Page 172]</span>
riuer the citie and countrie beareth the name, although we now pronounce
Hampton for Auondune, which errour is committed also in south Auondune,
as we may easilie see. In another place Leland describeth the said riuer
after this maner. The Auon riseth in Nene méere field, and going by
Oundale and Peterborow, it diuideth it selfe into thrée armes, whereof
one goeth to Horneie, another to Wisbech, the third to Ramseie: and
afterward being vnited againe, they fall into the sea not verie farre
from Lin. Finallie, the descent of these waters leaue here a great sort
of Ilands, wherof Elie, Crowland, and Mersland, are the chiefe. Hitherto
Leland.</p>

<p>Howbeit, because neither of these descriptions touch the course of this
riuer at the full, I will set downe the third, which shall supplie
whatsoeuer the other doo want. The Auon therefore arising in Nenemere
field, is increased with manie rilles, before it come at Northampton, &amp;
one aboue Kings thorpe, from whence it goeth to Dallington, and so to
Northhampton, where it receiueth the Wedon. And here I will staie, till
<span class="leftnote">Vedunus.</span>
I haue described this riuer. The Wedon therefore riseth at Faulesse in
master Knightlies pooles, and in Badbie plashes also are certeine
springs that resort vnto this streame. Faulesse pooles are a mile from
Chareton, where the head of Chare riuer is, that runneth to Banberie.
There is but an hill called Alberie hill betwéene the heads of these two
riuers.</p>
<p>
From the said hill therefore the Wedon directeth his course to Badbie,
Newenham, Euerton, Wedon, betwixt which and Floretowne, it receiueth the
<span class="leftnote">Florus.</span>
Florus (a pretie water rising of foure heads, whereof the one is at
Dauentrie, another at Watford, the third at long Bucke, the fourth aboue
Whilton) and then passeth on to Heiford, Kislingberie, Vpton, and so to
Northhampton, where it falleth into the Auon, receiuing finallie by the
<span class="leftnote">Bugius.</span>
waie the Bugbrooke water at Heiford, Patshall water néere Kislingberie,
and finallie Preston water beneath Vpton, which running from Preston by
Wootton, méeteth at the last with Milton rill, and so fall into Auon.
Now to resume the tractation of our Auon. From Northhampton therefore it
runneth by Houghton, great Billing, Whitstone, Dodington, and
Willingborow, where we must staie a while: for betweene Willingborow and
<span class="leftnote">Kilis.</span>
Higham ferries, it receiueth a pretie water comming from about Kilmarsh,
which going by Ardingworth, Daisborow, Rusheton, Newton, Gaddington,
Boughton, Warketon, Kettering, Berton, and Burton, méeteth there with
<span class="leftnote">Rother.</span>
Rothwell water, which runneth west of Kettering to Hisham, the greater
Haridon, and then into the Auon.</p>
<p>
Being therfore past Burton, our maine streame goeth to Higham Ferries,
Artleborow, Ringsted, Woodford, and (méeting thereby with Cranford rill)
<span class="leftnote">Ocleie.</span>
to Thraxton, north whereof it ioineth also with the Ocleie water, that
commeth from Sudborow and Lowicke, to old Vmkles, Waden ho, Pilketon,
Toke (where it taketh in the Liueden becke) and so to Oundell,
Cotterstocke, Tansoner, and betweene Tothering and Warmington receiueth
<span class="leftnote">Corbie.</span>
the Corbie water, which rising at Corbie, goeth by Weldon, Denethap,
Bulwich, Bletherwijc, Fineshed, Axthorpe, Newton, Tothering, and so into
the Auon. After this, the said Auon goeth to Elton, Massittgton,
Yerwell, Sutton, Castor, Allerton, and so to Peterborow, where it
diuideth it selfe into sundrie armes, and those into seuerall branches
and draines, among the fennes and medowes, not possible almost to be
numbred, before it méet with the sea on the one side of the countrie,
and fall into the Ouze on the other.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Isis 3.</span>
The Ouze, which Leland calleth the third Isis, falleth into the sea
betwéene Mersland &amp; Downeham. The chiefe head of this riuer ariseth
néere to Stanes, from whence it commeth to Brackleie (sometime a noble
towne in Northampton shire, but now scarselie a good village) and there
taking in on the left hand one water comming from the parke betwéene
<span class="leftnote">Sisa.</span>
Sisam and Astwell (which runneth by Whitfield and Tinweston) and another
<span class="rightnote">Imelus.</span>
on the right from Imleie, it goeth on by Westbirie, Fulwell, water
Stretford, Buckingham, and Berton, beneath which towne the Erin falleth
into it, whereof I find this short description to be inserted here. The
<span class="leftnote">Erin.</span>
Erin riseth not farre from Hardwijc in Northamptonshire, from hence it
goeth by Heth, Erinford, Godderington, Twiford, Steeple Cladon, &amp; yer it
<span class="rightnote">Garan.</span>
come at Padbirie, méeteth with the Garan brooke descending from
Garanburge, and so they go togither by Padbirie, till they fall into the
<span class="page"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[Page 173]</span>
Ouze, which carieth them after the confluence to Thorneton bridge (where
they crosse another fall of water comming from Whitlewood forrest by
Luffeld, Lecamsted and Foscot) and so to Beachampton, Culuerton, Stonie
Stratford, and Woluerton.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Verus.</span>
Here the Ouze méeteth with a water (called, as Leland coniectureth, the
Vere or Were) on the left hand, as you go downewards, that commeth
betwéene Wedon and Wexenham in Northamptonshire, and goeth by Towcester,
and Alderton, and not farre from Woluerton and Hauersham into the
foresaid Ouze, which goeth also from hence to Newportpaganell, where in
like sort I must staie a while till I haue described another water,
<span class="leftnote">Cle aliàs Claius.</span>
named the Clée, by whose issue the said streame is not a little
increased. This riuer riseth in the verie confines betwéene Buckingham
and Bedfordshires, not farre from Whippesnade, and going on toward the
northwest, by Eaton and Laiton, it commeth to Linchlade, where it
entreth whollie into Buckinghamshire, and so goeth on by Hammond,
Brickle, Fennie Stratford, Simpson, Walton and Middleton, beneath which
<span class="leftnote">Saw.</span>
it receiueth the Saw from aboue Halcot, and so goeth on till it meet
with the Ouze néere vnto Newport, as I haue said. Being vnited
therefore, we set forward from the said towne, and follow this noble
riuer, to Lathbirie, Thuringham, Filgrane, Lawndon, Newington, Bradfield
on the one side, and Turueie on the other, till it come at length to
Bedford after manie windlesses, and then méeteth with another streame,
which is increased with so manie waters, that I was inforced to make an
imagined staie here also, and view their seuerall courses, supposing my
selfe to looke downe from the highest steeple in Bedford, whence (as
best meane to view anie countrie wheresoeuer) I note the same as
followeth.</p>

<p>Certes on the east side, where I began this speculation, I saw one that
came from Potton, and met withall néere Becliswade: another that grew of
two waters, wherof one descended from Baldocke, the other from Hitchin,
which ioined beneth Arleseie, and thence went to Langford and Edworth.
<span class="rightnote">These rise not far from Michelborow &amp; one of them in Higham
parke.</span>
The third which I beheld had in like sort two heads, wherof one is not
farre from Wood end, the other from Wooburne (or Howburne), and ioining
about Flitwijc, they go to Flitton (where they receiue Antill brooke)
and so by Chiphill, and Chicksand, they come to Shafford, from whence
taking the aforsaid Langford water with them, they go foorth by
Becliswade, Sandie, Blumham, and neere vnto Themisford are vnited with
the Ouze. And now to our purpose againe.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Verus or the Were.</span>
After this the Ouze goeth by Berkeford, to Winteringham (méeting there
with the Wareslie becke) and so runneth to S. Neotes (or saint Nedes, in
<span class="rightnote">Stoueus.</span>
old time Goluesburg, as Capgraue saith In vita Neoti) to Paxston,
Offordes, and so to Godmanchester, in old time called Gumicester, which
(as it should séeme) hath béene a towne of farre greater countenance
than at this present it is; for out of the ruines thereof much Romane
coine is found, and sometimes with the image of C. Antius which hath
long haire, as the Romans had before they receiued barbars into their
citie, and therevnto the bones of diuerse men of farre greater stature
than is credible to be spoken of in these daies. But what stand I vpon
these things? From hence therfore our water goeth on to Huntingdon,
Wilton, saint Iues, Holiwell, and Erith, receiueth in the meane time the
<span class="leftnote">Stoueus.<br />
Helenus.<br />
Elmerus.</span>
Stow (néere vnto little Paxton) and likewise the Ellen, and the Emmer,
in one chanell a little by west of Huntingdon.</p>

<p>Finallie, the maine streame spreading abroad into the Fennes, I cannot
tell into how manie branches, neither how manie Ilets are inforced by
the same; although of Iles, Marshland, Ancarig or Ancarie be the chiefe,
and of which this later is called Crowland (as Crowland also hight
thornie A cruda terra, or store of bushes saith Hugo le Blanc) sometime
growing in the same, and Ancarijc because sundrie Ancres haue liued &amp;
borne great swaie therein. But howsoeuer this case standeth, this is
certeine, that after it hath thus delited it selfe with ranging a while
about the pleasant bottoms &amp; lower grounds, it méeteth with the Granta,
from whence it goeth with a swift course vnto Downeham. Betwéene it also
and the Auon, are sundrie large meeres or plashes, by southwest of
Peterborow full of powts and carpes, whereof Whittleseie méere, and
<span class="rightnote">Riuelus.</span>
Ramseie méere (whereinto the Riuall falleth), that commeth from aboue
<span class="page"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[Page 174]</span>
Broughton, Wiston, and great Riuelleie) are said to be greatest. Of all
<span class="rightnote"><br />Granta.</span>
the riuers that run into this streame, that called Granta (whereof the
whole countie in old time was called Grantabrycshire, as appéereth by
the register of Henrie prior of Canturburie) is the most noble and
excellent, which I will describe euen in this place, notwithstanding
that I had earst appointed it vnto my second booke. But for somuch as a
description of Ouze and Granta were deliuered me togither, I will for
his sake that gaue them me, not separate them now in sunder.</p>

<p>The verie furthest head and originall of this riuer is in Henham, a
large parke belonging to the earle of Sussex, wherein (as the townesmen
saie) are foure springs that run foure sundrie waies into the maine sea.
Leland sought not the course of this water aboue Newport pond, and
therefore in his commentaries vpon the song of the swan, he writeth
thereof after this maner insuing. Although doctor Iohn Caius the learned
physician, and some other are of the opinion, that this riuer comming
from Newport, is properlie to be called the Rhée: but I may not so
easilie dissent from Leland, whose iudgement in my mind is by a great
deale the more likelie. Harken therefore what he saith.</p>

<p>The head of Grantha or Granta, is in the pond at Newport, a towne of the
east Saxons, which going in a bottome beside the same, receiueth a
pretie rill, which in the middest thereof dooth driue a mill, and
descendeth from Wickin Bonhant, that standeth not farre from thence.
Being past Newport, it goeth alongst in the lower ground, vntill it come
to Broke Walden, west of Chipping Walden (now Saffron Walden) hard by
the lord Awdleis place, where the right honorable Thomas Howard with his
houshold doo soiourne, and sometime stood an abbeie of Benedictine
moonks, before their generall suppression. From Awdleie end it goeth to
Littleburie, the lesse and greater Chesterfords, Yealdune, Hincstone,
<span class="leftnote">Babren.</span>
Seoston or Sawson, and néere vnto Shaleford receiueth the Babren that
commeth by Linton, Abbington, Babrenham, and Stapleford: and so going
forward it commeth at the last to Trompington, which is a mile from
Cambridge. But yer it come altogither to Trompington, it méeteth with
<span class="leftnote">Rhée.</span>
the Barrington water, as Leland calleth it, but some other the Rhee (a
common name to all waters in the Saxon speech) whereof I find this
description, to be touched by the waie. The Rhée riseth short of Ashwell
in Hertfordshire, and passing under the bridge betweene Gilden Mordon
and Downton, and leauing Tadlow on the west side (as I remember) it
goeth toward Crawden, Malton, Barrington, Haselingfield, and so into
Granta, taking sundrie rills with him from south and southwest, as
Wendie water southwest of Crawden, Whaddon brooke southwest of Orwell,
Mildred becke southwest of Malton, and finallie the Orme which commeth
out of Armington or Ormendum well, and goeth by Fulmere and Foxton, and
falleth into the same betweene Barrington and Harleston, or Harston; as
they call it.</p>

<p>Now to procéed with our Granta. From Trompington on the one side, and
Grantcester, on the other, it hasteth to Cambridge ward, taking the
Burne with it by the waie, which descendeth from a castell of the same
denomination, wherein the Picotes and Peuerels sometime did inhabit.
Thence it goeth by sundrie colleges in Cambridge, as the queenes
college, the kings college, Clare hall, Trinitie college, S. Johns, &amp;c:
vnto the high bridge of Cambridge, and betwéene the towne and the
<span class="leftnote">Sturus.</span>
castell to Chesterton, and receiuing by and by the Stoure, or Sture (at
whose bridge the most famous mart in England is yearlie holden and kept)
from Chesterton it goeth to Ditton, Milton, and yer long méeting with
two rilles (from Bottesham and Wilberham, in one bottome) it runneth to
<span class="leftnote">Bulbecke.</span>
Horningseie, &amp; Water Bech: and finallie here ioining with the Bulbecke
water, it goeth by Dennie, and so forth into the Ouze, fiftéene miles
from Cambridge, as Leland hath set downe. And thus much of the third
Isis or Ouze, out of the aforesaid author: wherevnto I haue not onelie
added somewhat of mine owne experience, but also of other mens notes,
whose diligent obseruation of the course of this riuer hath not a little
helped me in the description of the same. Now it resteth that we come
neerer to the coast of Northfolke, and set foorth such waters as we
passe by vpon the same, wherein I will deale so preciselie as I may: and
so farre will I trauell therein, as I hope shall content euen the curious
<span class="page"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[Page 175]</span>
reader: or if anie fault be made, it shall not be so great, but that
after some trauell in the finding, it shall with ease be corrected.</p>

<p>The first riuer that therefore we come vnto, after we be past the
confluence of Granta, and the Ouze, and within the iurisdiction of
<span class="leftnote">Burne.</span>
Northfolke, is called the Burne. This streame riseth not verie farre
from Burne Bradfield, aboue the greater Wheltham, and from thence it
goeth on to Nawnton, Burie, Farneham Martin, Farneham Alhallowes,
Farneham Genouefa, Hengraue, Flemton, Lackeford, Icklingham, and to
<span class="leftnote">Dale.</span>
Milden hall: a little beneath which, it meeteth with the Dale water,
that springeth not farre from Catilege, and going by Asheleie, Moulton
(a benefice as the report goeth not verie well prouided for) to Kenford,
Kenet, Bradingham, Frekenham, it falleth at the last not farre from
Iselham into the Burne, from whence they go togither as one into the
Ouze. With the Burne also there ioineth a water comming from about
Lidgate, a little beneath Iselham, and not verie far from Mildenhall.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Dunus.</span>
The Dune head, and rising of Wauenheie, are not much in sunder: for as
it is supposed, they are both not farre distant from the bridge betwéene
Loph&#257;m and Ford, wherby the one runneth east and the other west, as I
haue béene informed. The Dune goeth first of all by Feltham, then to
Hopton, &amp; to Kinets hall, where it meeteth with a water c&#333;ming out of
a lake short of Banham (going, by Quiddenham, Herling, Gasthorpe) and so
on, both in one chanell, they run to Ewston. Here they méet in like
sort, with another descending from two heads, wherof the one is néere
vnto Pakenham, the other to Tauestocke, as I heare. Certes these heads
ioine aboue Ilesworth, not farre from Stow Langtoft, from whence they go
to Yxworth, Thorpe, Berdwell, Hunnington, Fakenham, and so into the Dune
at Ewston; as I said. From hence also they hasten to Downeham, which of
this riuer dooth séeme to borow his name. South Rée rill I passe ouer as
not worthie the description, because it is so small.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bradunus fortè.</span>
Next vnto this riuer on the south side is the Braden, or Bradunus, which
riseth at Bradenham, and goeth by Necton, north Peckenham, south
Peckenham, Kirsingham, Bedneie, Langford, Igbor, Munford, North Old,
Stockebridge, Ferdham, Helgie, and so into the Ouze. The néerest vnto
<span class="leftnote">Linus.</span>
this is another which riseth about Lukeham, and from thence commeth to
Lexham, Massingham, Newton, the castell Acre, Acres, Nerboe, Pentneie,
Wrongeie, Rounghton (which at one time might haue béene my liuing if I
would haue giuen sir Thomas Rugband money inough, but now it belongeth
to Gundeuill and Caius college in Cambridge) Westchurch, and so to
Linne. As so dooth also another by north of this, which commeth from the
<span class="leftnote">Congunus.</span>
east hilles by Congenham, Grimston, Bawseie, Gaiwood, whereof let this
suffice. And now giue eare to the rest sith I am past the Ouze. Being
<span class="leftnote">Rising.</span>
past the mouth or fall of the Ouze, we méet next of all with the Rising
chase water, which Ptolomie (as some thinke) doth call Metaris, and
<span class="leftnote">Ingell.</span>
descendeth from two heads, and also the Ingell that commeth from about
Snetsham. From hence we go by the point of saint Edmund, and so hold on
our course till we come vnto the Burne, which falleth into the sea by
south from Waterden, and going betwéene the Crakes to Burnham Thorpe,
and Burnham Norton, it striketh at the last into the sea; east of
Burnham Norton a mile at the least, except my coniecture doo faile me.
<span class="leftnote">Glouius.</span>
The Glow or Glowie riseth not far from Baconsthorpe, in the hundred of
Tunsted; &amp; going by and by into Holt hundred, it passeth by Hunworth,
Thornage, Glawnsford, Blackneie, Clare, and so into the sea, receiuing
there at hand also a rill by east, which descendeth from the hilles
lieng betwéene Killing towne and Waiburne.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Wantsume.</span>
The Wantsume riseth in Northfolke at Galesend in Holt hundred, from
whence it goeth to Watersend, Townton, Skelthorpe, Farneham, Pensthorpe,
Rieburg, Ellingham, and Billingsford. And here it receiueth two waters
in one bottome, of which the first goeth by Stanfield and Beteleie, the
other by Wandling and Gressonhall, and so run on ech his owne waie, till
they méet at Houndlington, southwest of Billingsford with the Wantsume.
From hence they go all togither to Below, Ieng, Weston, and Moreton; but
<span class="leftnote">Yocus.</span>
yer it come to Moreton, it méeteth with the Yowke, which (issuing about
Yexham) goeth by Matteshall and Barrow. After this the said Wantsume
goeth on by Ringland, and so to Norwich the pontificall sée of the bishop,
<span class="page"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[Page 176]</span>
to whome that iurisdiction apperteineth, which seemeth by this memoriall
yet remaining in the corrupted name of the water, to be called in old
time Venta, or (as Leland addeth) Venta Icenorum. But to procéed.
Beneath Norwich also it receiueth two waters in one chanell, which I
will seuerallie describe, according to their courses, noting their
confluence to be at Bixleie, within two miles of Norwich, except my
annotation deceiue me. The first of these hath two heads wherof one
mounteth vp southwest of Whinborow, goeth by Gerneston, and is the verie
<span class="leftnote">Hierus.<br />
Gerus.</span>
Hiere or Yare that drowneth the name of Wantsume, so soone as he meeteth
withall. The other head riseth at Wood in Mitford hundred, and after
confluence with the Hiere at Caston, going by Brandon, Bixton, Berford,
Erleham, Cringlefield (not farre from Bixleie as I said) doth méet with
his companion, which is the second to be described as followeth. It hath
two heads also that méet northwest of Therstane; and hereof the one
commeth from Findon hall, by Wrenningham from about Wotton, by Hemnall,
Fretton, Stretton, and Tasborow, till they ioine at Therston, as I gaue
notice aforehand. From Therston therefore they go togither in one to
Newton, Shotesham, Dunston, Castor, Arminghale, Bixleie, Lakenham, and
Trowse, and then fall into the Wantsume beneath Norwich, which hereafter
is named Hiere. The Hiere, Yare, or Gare therefore proceeding in his
voiage, as it were to salute his grandame the Ocean, goeth from thence
by Paswijc, Surlingham, Claxton, and Yardleie; and here it meeteth
againe with another riueret descending from about Shotesham to
Therstane, Shedgraue, Hockingham, and so into Gare or Yare, whereof
Yardleie the towne receiueth denomination. After this it goeth to
<span class="leftnote">Wauen.</span>
Frethorpe, and aboue Burgh castell meeteth with the Waueneie, and so
into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bure.</span>
Into this riuer also falleth the Bure, which rising at a towne of the
same name, passeth by Milton, Buresdune, Corpesteie, Marington,
Blekeling, Bure, Alesham, Brampton, Buxton, Horsted, Werxham bridge,
<span class="leftnote">Thurinus.</span>
Horning, Raneworth; and beneath Bastewijc receiueth the Thurine which
riseth aboue Rolesbie; then to Obie, Clipsbie (there also receiuing
another from Filbie) Rimham, Castor, and by Yarmouth into the Ocean. The
Waueneie afore mentioned, riseth on the south side of Brisingham, and is
a limit betweene Northfolke and Suffolke. Going therefore by Dis,
Starton, not farre from Octe, it méeteth with the Eie, which riseth
néere Ockold, or betwéene it and Braisworth, &amp; goeth on by Brome, Octe,
<span class="leftnote">Wauen.</span>
and so into the Waueneie. From thence our Waueneie runneth by Silam,
Brodish, Nedam, Harleston, Rednam, Alborow, Flixton, Bungeie,
Sheepemedow, Barsham, Beckles, Albie, &amp; at Whiteacre (as I heare)
parteth in twaine, or receiuing Milford water (which is most likelie) it
<span class="rightnote">Einus.</span>
goeth along by Somerleie, Hormingfléet, S. Olaues, (there receiuing the
<span class="leftnote">Fritha.</span>
Frithstane or Fristan brooke, out of low or litle England) Fristan &amp;
Burgh castell, where it méeteth with the Hiere, &amp; from thencefoorth
accompanieth it (as I said) vnto the sea. Willingham water commeth by
Hensted, Einsted, or Enistate, and falleth into the sea by south of
Kesland.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Cokelus.</span>
The Cokell riseth south southwest of Cokeleie towne in Blithe hundred,
and neere vnto Hastelworth it meeteth with the rill that commeth from
Wisset, and so going on togither by Wenhaston, and Bliborow, it falleth
into the sea at an hauen betwéene Roidon and Walderswicke. A little rill
runneth also thereinto from Eston by Sowold, and another from Dunwich,
by Walderswijke: and hereby it wanteth little that Eston Nesse is not
cut off and made a pretie Iland.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Ford.</span>
The Ford riseth at Yoxford, and going by Forderleie, and Theberton, it
<span class="rightnote">Orus.</span>
falleth at last into Mismere créeke. Into the Oreford hauen runneth one
water comming from Aldborow ward, by a narrow passage from the north
<span class="leftnote">Fromus.</span>
into the south. By west wherof (when we are past a little Ile) it
receiueth the second, descending from betwéene Talingston and Framingham
in Plomes hundred; which c&#333;ming at last to Marleford, meeteth with a
<span class="leftnote">Glema.</span>
rill southwest of Farnham called the Gleme (that commeth by Rendlesham,
the Gleinhams) and so passing foorth, it taketh another at Snapesbridge,
comming from Carleton by Saxmundham, Sternefield &amp; Snape. Then going to
<span class="rightnote">Iken, or Ike.</span>
Iken (where it méeteth with the third rill at the west side) it fetcheth
<span class="page"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[Page 177]</span>
a compasse by Sudburne east of Orford, and so into the hauen. Next vnto
this by west of Orford, there runneth vp another créeke by Butleie,
whereinto the waters comming from Cellesford, and from the Ike, doo run
both in one bottome. And thus much of Orford hauen.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Deua.</span>
The Deue riseth in Debenham, in the hundred of Hertesméere, and from
thence goeth to Mickford, Winston, Cretingham, Lethringham, Wickham,
hitherto still creeping toward the south: but then going in maner full
south, it runneth neere vnto Ash, Rendlesham, Vfford, Melton, and
Woodbridge, beneath which it receiueth on the west side, a water comming
of two heads, wherof one is by north from Oteleie, and the other by
south from Henleie, which ioining west of Mertelsham, go vnto the said
towne and so into the Deue, east of Mertelsham abouesaid. From thence
the Deue goeth by Waldringfield and Henleie, and méeting soone after
<span class="leftnote">Clarus fons.</span>
with Brightwell brooke, it hasteth into the maine sea, leauing Bawdseie
on the east, where the fall therof is called Bawdseie hauen.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Vrus.</span>
Vre riseth not farre from Bacton, in Hertesmeere hundred, and thense
descendeth into Stow hundred by Gipping Newton, Dagworth, Stow (beneath
which it méeteth with a water comming from Rattlesden, by one house) and
so going on to Nedeham (through Bosméere and Claidon hundreds) to
Blakenham, Bramford, Ypswich, receiuing beneath Stoke, which lieth ouer
against Ypswich, the Chatsham water, that goeth by Belsted, and so into
the Vre, at the mouth whereof is a maruellous deepe and large pit,
whereof some marriners saie that they could neuer find the bottome, and
therefore calling it a well, and ioining the name of the riuer withall,
it commeth to passe that the hauen there is called Vrewell, for which in
these daies we doo pronounce it Orwell. Into this hauen also the Sture
or Stoure hath readie passage, which remaineth in this treatise next of
all to be described.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Sturus.</span>
The Sture or Stoure parteth Essex from Suffolke, as Houeden saith, and
experience confirmeth. It ariseth in Suffolke, out of a lake neere vnto
a towne called Stourméere. For although there come two rilles vnto the
same, whereof the one descendeth from Thirlo, the Wratings and Ketton,
the other from Horshed parke, by Hauerill, &amp;c: yet in summer time they
are often drie, so that they cannot be said to be perpetuall heads vnto
the aforesaid riuer. The Stoure therefore (being, as I take it, called
by Ptolomie, Edomania, for thereon toward the mouth standeth a prettie
towne named Manitrée, which carieth some shadow of that ancient name
thereof vnto this daie, if my coniecture be any thing) ariseth at
Stouremeere, which is a poole conteining twentie acres of ground at the
least, the one side whereof is full of alders, the other of réeds,
wherin the great store of fish there bred, is not a little succoured.
From this méere also it goeth to Bathorne bridge, to Stocke clare,
Cawndish, Pentlo, Paules Beauchampe, Milford, Foxerth, Buresleie,
Sudburie, Bures, Boxsted, Stoke, Nailand, Lanham, Dedham, Strotford,
east Barfold, Brampton, Manitree, Catwade bridge, and so into the sea,
where in the verie fall also it ioineth with Orwell hauen, so néere that
of manie they are reputed as one, and parted but by a shingle that dooth
run along betwéene them: neither dooth it passe cléere in this voiage,
but as it were often occupied by the waie, in receiuing sundrie brookes
and rilles not héere to be omitted.</p>

<p>For on Essex side it hath one from Hemsted, which goeth by Bumsted, and
Birdbrooke: another rising short of Foxerth, that runneth by water
Beauchampe, Brundon, and falleth into the same at Badlington, west of
Sudburie: and the third that glideth by Horkesleie, and méeteth withall
west of Boxsted. On the north, or vpon Suffolke side, it receiueth one
descending from Catiledge, by Bradleie, Thurlow, Wratting, Kiddington,
and at Hauerell falleth into this Sture. The second descendeth northward
from Posling field, and ioineth therewith east of Clare. It was in old
time called Cicux or Ceuxis, and it méeteth with the Stoure in such wise
that they séeme to make a right angle, in the point almost wherof
standeth a ruinous castell. Howbeit as sithence which time this water
(in some mens iudgement) hath béene named Clarus (not so much for the
greatnesse as clearnesse of the streame) even so the Stoure it selfe was
also called Ens as they say, and after their confluence the whole
Clarens, which giueth denomination to a duchie of this Iland of no small
<span class="page"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[Page 178]</span>
fame and honour. But these are but méere fables, sith the word Clare is
deriued from the towne, wherein was an house of religion erected to one
Clara, and Clarens brought from the same, because of an honour the
prince had in those parties: which may suffice to know from whence the
name proceedeth. The third ariseth of two heads, whereof one commeth
from Wickham brooke, the other from Chedbar in Risbie hundred, and
ioining about Stanfield, it goeth by Hawton, Somerton, Boxsted,
Stansted, and north of Foxerth falleth into Stoure. The fourth issueth
from betwéene the Waldingfields, and goeth by Edwardstone, Boxsted,
Alington, Polsted, Stoke, and so at south Boxsted falleth into the same.
The fift riseth northwest of Cockefield, and goeth to Cockefield,
<span class="leftnote">Kettle baston.</span>
Laneham, Brimsleie, Midling, and receiuing Kettle Baston water southwest
of Chelsworth (and likewise the Breton that commeth from Bretenham, by
Hitcheham, and Bisseton stréet on the south east of the same towne) it
goeth in by Nedging, Aldham, Hadleie, Lainham, Shellie, Higham, and so
into the Stoure. The sixt is a little rill descending southwest from
Chappell. The seuenth riseth betweene Chappell and Bentleie, and going
betwéene Tatingston, and Whetsted, Holbrooke, and Sutton, it falleth at
length into Stoure, and from thence is neuer heard of.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Ocleie.</span>
As for Ocleie Drill, that riseth betweene Ocleie, and Wikes parkes, and
so goeth into the Stoure, on Essex side, west of Harwich, and east of
Rée Ile; I passe it ouer, because it is of it selfe but a rill, and not
of anie greatnesse, till it come to the mill aboue Ramseie bridge, where
I was once almost drowned (by reason of the ruinous bridge which leadeth
ouer the streame being there verie great) as an arme of the sea that
continuallie ebbeth &amp; floweth. Next vnto this, we came to another that
<span class="leftnote">Mosa.</span>
runneth south of Beaumont by Mosse, and falleth into the sea about the
middest of the Baie, betwixt Harwich and the Naze. Betwixt the Naze also
and the mouth of Colne, is another rill, which riseth at little Bentleie,
<span class="leftnote">Claco.</span>
and thence goeth to Tendring thorpe, through Clacton parke by great
Holland, and east of little Holland, into the déepe sea.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Colunus.</span>
The Colne hath three heads, whereof one is at Ouington that goeth by
Tilberie, and east of Yeldam falleth into the chiefe head which riseth
about Redgewell in Essex, from whence also it goeth to Yeldam and
Hedingham, otherwise called Yngham: also Hedningham or Heuedingham, *
<span class="rightnote">* Sic.</span>
or Heuedingham of the superioritie which accrued therevnto, because the
chiefe lords of the same from time to time kept residence in the towne.
For Heued or Hed signifieth The chiefe, in the old English language,
which in the name of this and manie other townes and villages yet
standing in England cannot easilie be forgotten. The third falleth in
south of Yeldam, and being once met all in one chanell, and called the
Colne, it goeth (as I said) to Hedningham, Hawsted, Erles Colne, Wakes
Colne, Fordon, Bardfold, Colchester, in old time Camalodunum, and so
into the sea at Brickleseie. Some thinke that Colchester and Camalodunum
are sundrie cities and situat in diuerse places, whereby Maldon (or
Ithancester out of whose ruines the said towne of Maldon was erected)
should rather be Camalodunum than Colchester, but hereof I cannot iudge.
Indeed if (as Leland saith) Maldon should be written Malodunum, it were
a likelihood that there assertions should be probable. Some reason also
may be gathered for the same out of Dion, and such as make the Thames
mouth to take his beginning at Colchester water. But I dare not presume
to conclude any thing hereof, least I should séeme rashlie to take hold
of euerie coniecture. This I relie vpon rather as a more certeintie,
that in the first edition of this treatise I was persuaded, that the sea
entring by the Colne made thrée seuerall passages fr&#333; thence into the
land: but now I vnderstand that these are seuerall entrances and
streames, of which the Colne is one, another is the Salcote water, which
commeth in beneath the Stroud (a causeie that leadeth vnto Merseie Ile,
ouer which the sea méeteth with a contrarie course) and the third the
faire arme that floweth vnto Maldon, and all these thrée haue their
falles either ouer against or néere vnto the aforesaid Ile, which at a
low water is not halfe a mile from the shore. Into the Colne or Colunus
also (whereof Leland thinketh Colchester to take his name, and not A
colonia Romanorum, although I may not consent to him herein) doo run
manie salt creekes beneath Fingering ho, of whose names sith I doo not
<span class="page"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[Page 179]</span>
know, nor whether they be serued with anie backewaters or not, I giue
ouer to intreat anie further &amp; likewise of their positions. Into that of
Maldon runneth manie faire waters, whereof I will saie so much as I know
to be true in maner by experience.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Gwin or Pant.</span>
There is a pretie water that beginneth néere vnto Gwinbach or Winbeche
church in Essex, a towne of old, and yet belonging to the Fitzwaters,
taking name of Gwin, which is beautifull or faire, &amp; Bache that
signifieth a wood: and not without cause, sith not onelie the hilles on
ech side of the said rillet, but all the whole paroch hath sometime
abounded in woods; but now in manner they are vtterlie decaied, as the
like commoditie is euerie where, not onelie thorough excessiue building
for pleasure more than profit, which is contrarie to the ancient end of
building; but also for more increase of pasture &amp; commoditie to the
lords of the soile, through their sales of that emolument, whereby the
poore tenants are inforced to buie their fewell, and yet haue their
rents in triple maner inhanced.) This said brooke runneth directlie from
thence vnto Radwinter, now a parcell of your lordships possessions in
those parts, descended from the Chamberleins, who were sometime chéefe
owners of the same. By the waie also it is increased with sundrie pretie
springs, of which Pantwell is the chéefe (whereof some thinke the whole
brooke to be named Pant) and which (to saie the truth) hath manie a
leasing fathered on the same. Certes by the report of common fame it
hath béene a pretie water, and of such quantitie, that botes haue come
in time past from Bilie abbeie beside Maldon vnto the moores in
Radwinter for corne. I haue heard also that an anchor was found there
neere to a red willow, when the water-courses by act of parlement were
surueied and reformed throughout England, which maketh not a little with
the aforesaid relation. But this is strangest of all, that a lord
sometime of Winbech (surnamed the great eater, because he would breake
his fast with a whole calfe, and find no bones therein as the fable
goeth) falling at contention with the lord Iohn of Radwinter, could
worke him none other iniurie, but by stopping vp the head of Pantwell,
to put by the vse of a mill which stood by the church of Radwinter, and
was serued by that brooke abundantlie. Certes I know the place where the
mill stood, and some posts thereof doo yet remaine. But sée the malice
of mankind, whereby one becommeth a woolfe vnto the other in their
mischeeuous moodes. For when the lord saw his mill to be so spoiled, he
in reuenge of his losse, brake the necke of his aduersarie, when he was
going to horsebacke, as the constant report affirmeth. For the lord of
Radwinter holding a parcell of his manour of Radwinter hall of the
Fitzwaters, his sonne was to hold his stirrop at certeine times when he
should demand the same. Shewing himselfe therefore prest on a time to
doo his said seruice, as the Fitzwater was readie to lift his leg ouer
the saddle, he by putting backe his foot, gaue him such a thrust that he
fell backward, and brake his necke: wherevpon insued great trouble, till
the matter was taken vp by publike authoritie; and that seruile office
conuerted into a pound of pepper, which is trulie paid to this daie. But
to leaue these impertinent discourses, and returne againe to the springs
whereby our Pant or Gwin is increased. There is likewise another in a
pasture belonging to the Grange, now in possession of William Bird
esquier, who holdeth the same in the right of his wife, but in time past
belonging to Tilteie abbeie. The third commeth out of the yard of one of
your lordships manors there called Radwinter hall. The fourth from Iohn
Cockswets house, named the Rotherwell, which running vnder Rothers
bridge, méeteth with the Gwin or Pant on the northwest end of Ferrants
meade, southeast of Radwinter church, whereof I haue the charge by your
honours fauourable preferment.</p>

<p>I might take occasion to speake of another rill which falleth into the
Rother from Bendish hall: but bicause it is for the most part drie in
summer I passe it ouer. Yet I will not omit to speake also of the manor
which was the chiefe lordship sometime of a parish or hamlet called
Bendishes, now worne out of knowledge, and vnited partlie to Radwinter,
and partlie to Ashdon. It belonged first to the Bendishes gentlemen of a
verie ancient house yet extant, of which one laieng the said manour to
morgage to the moonks of Feuersham, at such time as K. Edward the third
went to the siege of Calis, thereby to furnish himselfe the better toward
<span class="page"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[Page 180]</span>
the seruice of his prince, it came to passe that he staied longer beyond
the sea than he supposed. Wherevpon he came before his daie to confer
with his creditors, who commending his care to come out of debt, willed
him in friendlie maner not to suspect anie hard dealing on their
behalfes, considering his businesse in seruice of the king was of it
selfe cause sufficient, to excuse his delaie of paiment vpon the daie
assigned. Herevpon he went ouer againe vnto the siege of Calis. But when
the daie came, the moonks for all this made seisure of the manour, and
held it continuallie without anie further recompense, maugre all the
friendship that the aforesaid Bendish could make. The said gentleman
also tooke this cousening part in such choler, that he wrote a note yet
to be séene among his euidences, whereby he admonisheth his posteritie
to beware how they trust either knaue moonke or knaue frier, as one of
the name and descended from him by lineall descent hath more than once
informed me. Now to resume our springs that méet and ioine with our
Pant.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Froshwell.</span>
The next is named Froshwell. And of this spring dooth the whole hundred
beare the name, &amp; after this confluence the riuer it selfe whervnto it
falleth (from by north) so farre as I remember. Certes, all these,
sauing the first and second, are within your lordships towne aforesaid.
The streame therefore running from hence (&amp; now, as I said, called
Froshwell, of Frosh, which signifieth a frog) hasteth immediatlie vnto
old Sandford, then through new Sandford parke, and afterward with full
streame (receiuing by the waie, the Finch brooke that commeth thorough
Finchingfield) to Shalford, Bocking, Stifted, Paswijc, and so to
Blackewater, where the name of Froshwell ceaseth, the water being from
hencefoorth (as I heare) commonlie called Blackwater, vntill it come to
Maldon, where it falleth into the salt arme of the sea that beateth vpon
the towne; and which of some (except I be deceiued) is called also Pant:
and so much the rather I make this conjecture, for that Ithancester
stood somewhere vpon the banks thereof, &amp; in the hundred of Danseie,
whose ruines (as they saie) also are swalowed vp by the said streame,
which can not be verified in our riuer that runneth from Pantwell, which
at the mouth and fall into the great current, excéedeth not (to my
coniecture) aboue one hundred foot. But to returne to our Pant, alias
the Gwin. From Blackwater it goeth to Coxall, Easterford, Braxsted and
<span class="leftnote">Barus.</span>
Wickham, where it méeteth with the Barus, and so going togither as one,
they descend to Heiebridge, and finallie into the salt water aboue
Maldon, and at hand as is aforesaid. As for the Barus, it riseth in a
statelie parke of Essex called Bardfield, belonging to sir Thomas Wroth
whilest he liued, who hath it to him and his heires males for euer, from
the crowne. Being risen, it hasteth directlie to old Saling Brainetrée,
crossing a rillet by the waie comming from Raine, blacke Norleie, white
Norleie, Falkeburne, Wittham, and falleth into the Blackewater beneath
Braxsted on the south.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Chelmer.</span>
Beside this, the said Pant or Gwin receiueth the Chelme or Chelmer,
which ariseth also in Wimbech aforesaid, where it hath two heads: of
which the one is not farre from Brodockes (where master Thomas Wiseman
esquier dwelleth) the other nigh vnto a farme called Highams in the same
paroch, and ioining yer long in one chanell, they hie them toward
Thacsted vnder Prowds bridge, méeting in the waie with a rill comming
from Boiton end, whereby it is somewhat increased. Being past Thacsted,
it goeth by Tilteie, and soone after receiueth one rill which riseth on
<span class="leftnote">Lindis.</span>
the north side of Lindsell, &amp; falleth into the Chelmer by northeast at
Tilteie aforesaid, &amp; another c&#333;ming from southwest, rising southeast
from Lindsell at much Eiston. From thence then holding on still with the
course, it goeth to Candfield the more, Dunmow, litle Dunmow, Falsted,
Lies, both Walthams, Springfield, and so to Chelmeresford. Here vpon the
south side I find the issue of a water that riseth fiue miles (or
thereabouts) south and by west of the said towne, from whence it goeth
to Munasing, Buttesburie (there receiuing a rill from by west, to
Ingatstone, Marget Inge, Widford bridge, Writtle bridge, and so to
Chelmeresford (crossing also the second water that descendeth from
<span class="leftnote">Roxford.</span>
Roxford southwest of Writtle by the waie) whereof let this suffice.</p>

<p>From hence the Chelmer goeth directlie toward Maldon by Badow, Owting,
Woodham water, Bilie, and so to Blackwater northwest of Maldon,
receiuing neuerthelesse yer it come fullie thither, a becke also that
<span class="page"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[Page 181]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Lée.</span>
goeth from Lée parke, to little Lées, great Lées, Hatfield, Peuerell,
Owting, and so into Blackwater (whereof I spake before) as Maldon
streame dooth a rill from by south ouer against saint Osithes, and also
another by Bradwell. After which the said streame growing also to be
verie great, passeth by the Tolshunts, Tollesbie, and so foorth into the
maine sea neere vnto Marseie: betwéene which fall and the place where
Salute water entreth into the land, Plautus abode the comming of
Claudius sometime into Britaine, when he being hardlie beeset, did send
vnto him for aid and spéedie succour, who also being come did not onelie
rescue his legat, but in like manner wan Colchester, and put it to the
spoile, if it be Camalodunum.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Burne.</span>
The Burne riseth somewhere about Ronwell, and thence goeth to Hull
bridge, south Fambridge, Kirkeshot ferrie, and so to Foulnesse. And as
this is the short course of that riuer, so it brancheth, and the south
arme thereof receiueth a water comming from Haukewell, to great
Stanbridge, and beneath Pakesham dooth méet by south with the said arme,
and so finish vp his course, as we doo our voiage also about the coast
of England.</p>

<p>Thus haue I finished the description of such riuers and streames as fall
into the Ocean, according to my purpose, although not in so precise an
order and manner of handling as I might, if information promised had
been accordinglie performed; or others would, if they had taken the like
in hand. But this will I saie of that which is here done, that from the
Solueie by west, which parteth England &amp; Scotland on that side; to the
Twede, which separateth the said kingdoms on the east: if you go
backeward, contrarie to the course of my description, you shall find it
so exact, as beside a verie few by-riuers, you shall not need to vse
anie further aduise for the finding and falles of the aforesaid streames.
For such hath beene my helpe of maister Sackfords cardes, and conference
with other men about these, that I dare pronounce them to be perfect and
exact. Furthermore, this I haue also to remember, that in the courses of
our streames, I regard not so much to name the verie towne or church, as
the limits of the paroch. And therefore if I saie it goeth by such a
towne, I thinke my dutie discharged, if I hit vpon anie part or parcell
of the paroch. This also hath not a little troubled me, I meane the
euill writing of the names of manie townes and villages: of which I haue
noted some one man, in the description of a riuer, to write one towne
two or thrée manner of waies, whereby I was inforced to choose one (at
aduenture most commonlie) that séemed the likeliest to be sound in mine
opinion and iudgement.</p>

<p>Finallie, whereas I minded to set downe an especiall chapter of ports
and créeks, lieng on ech coast of the English part of this Ile; and had
prouided the same in such wise as I iudged most conuenient: it came to
passe, that the greater part of my labour was taken from me by stealth,
and therefore as discouraged to meddle with that argument, I would haue
giuen ouer to set downe anie thing therefore at all: and so much the
rather, for that I sée it may prooue a spurre vnto further mischéefe, as
things come to passe in these daies. Neuerthelesse, because a little
thereof is passed in the beginning of the booke, I will set downe that
parcell thereof which remaineth, leauing the supplie of the rest either
to my selfe hereafter, (if I may come by it) or to some other that can
better performe the same.</p>

<p>It maie be that I haue in these former chapters omitted sundrie hauens

backe waters, through want of sound and sufficient information from such

<small>OF THE AIRE, SOILE, AND COMMODITIES OF THIS ILAND.</small><br />

CAP. XVIII.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">The aire of Britaine.</span>
The aire (for the most part) throughout the Iland is such, as by reason
in maner of continuall clouds, is reputed to be grosse, and nothing so
pleasant as that is of the maine. Howbeit, as they which affirme these
things, haue onelie respect to the impediment or hinderance of the sunne
beames, by the interposition of the clouds and oft ingrossed aire: so
experience teacheth vs, that it is no lesse pure, wholesome, and
commodious, than is that of other countries, and (as Cæsar himselfe
hereto addeth) much more temperate in summer than that of the Galles,
from whom he aduentured hither. Neither is there anie thing found in the
aire of our region, that is not vsuallie séene amongst other nations
lieng beyond the seas. Wherefore, we must néeds confesse, that the
situation of our Iland (for benefit of the heauens) is nothing inferiour
to that of anie countrie of the maine, where so euer it lie vnder the
open firmament. And this Plutarch knew full well, who affirmeth a part
of the Elisian fields to be found in Britaine, and the Iles that are
situate about it in the Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The soile.</span>
The soile of Britaine is such, as by the testimonies and reports both of
the old and new writers, and experience also of such as now inhabit the
same, is verie fruitfull; and such in deed as bringeth foorth manie
commodities, whereof other countries haue néed, and yet it selfe (if fond
nicenesse were abolished) néedlesse of those that are dailie brought from
other places. Neuerthelesse it is more inclined to féeding and grasing,
than profitable for tillage, and bearing of corne; by reason whereof the
countrie is wonderfullie replenished with neat, and all kind of cattell:
and such store is there also of the same in euerie place, that the fourth
part of the land is scarselie manured for the prouision and maintenance
of graine. Certes this fruitfulnesse was not vnknowne vnto the Britons
long before Cæsars time, which was the cause wherefore our predecessors
liuing in those daies in maner neglected tillage, and liued by féeding
and grasing onelie. The grasiers themselues also then dwelled in
mooueable villages by companies, whose custome was to diuide the ground
amongst them, and each one not to depart from the place where his lot
<span class="leftnote">Criacht.</span>
laie (a thing much like to the Irish Criacht) till by eating vp of the
countrie about him, he was inforced to remooue further, and séeke for
better pasture. And this was the British custome (as I learne) at first.
It hath béene commonlie reported, that the ground of Wales is neither so
fruitfull as that of England, neither the soile of Scotland so
bountifull as that of Wales: which is true, for corne and for the most
part: otherwise, there is so good ground in some parts of Wales, as is
in England, albeit the best of Scotland be scarselie comparable to the
meane of either of both. Howbeit, as the bountie of the Scotish dooth
faile in some respect, so dooth it surmount in other; God and nature
hauing not appointed all countries to yéeld foorth like commodities.</p>

<p>But where our ground is not so good as we would wish, we haue (if néed
be) sufficient help to cherish our ground withall, and to make it more
fruitfull. For beside the compest that is carried out of the husbandmens
yards, ditches, ponds, doouehouses, or cities and great townes: we haue
with vs a kind of white marle, which is of so great force, that if it be
cast ouer a péece of land but once in thrée score years, it shall not
need of anie further compesting. Hereof also dooth Plinie speake, lib.
<span class="leftnote">Marle.</span>
17, cap. 6, 7, 8, where he affirmeth that our marle indureth vpon the
earth by the space of fourescore yeares: insomuch that it is laid vpon
the same but once in a mans life, whereby the owner shall not need to
trauell twise in procuring to commend and better his soile. He calleth
it Marga, and making diuerse kinds thereof, he finallie commendeth ours,
and that of France, aboue all other, which lieth sometime a hundred foot
déepe, and farre better than the scattering of chalke vpon the same, as
the Hedni and Pictones did in his time, or as some of our daies also doo
practise: albeit diuerse doo like better to cast on lime, but it will
not so long indure, as I haue heard reported.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[Page 184]</span></p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Plentie of riuers.</span>
There are also in this Iland great plentie of fresh riuers and streams,
as you haue heard alreadie, and these throughlie fraught with all kinds
of delicate fish accustomed to be found in riuers. The whole Ile
<span class="leftnote">Hilles.</span>
likewise is verie full of hilles, of which some (though not verie manie)
are of exceeding heigth, and diuerse extending themselues verie far from
the beginning; as we may see by Shooters hill, which rising east of
London, and not farre from the Thames, runneth along the south side of
the Iland westward, vntill it come to Cornewall. Like vnto these also
are the Crowdon hils, which though vnder diuers names (as also the other
from the Peke) doo run into the borders of Scotland. What should I
speake of the Cheuiot hilles, which reach twentie miles in length? of
<span class="rightnote">(*) Here lacks.</span>
the blacke mounteines in Wales, which go from (*) to (*) miles at the
least in length? of the Cle hilles in Shropshire, which come within
foure miles of Ludlow, and are diuided from some part of Worcester by
the Teme? of the Grames in Scotland, and of our Chiltren, which are
eightéene miles at the least from one end of them, which reach from
Henlie in Oxfordshire to Dunstable in Bedfordshire, and are verie well
replenished with wood and corne? notwithstanding that the most part
yéeld a sweet short grasse, profitable for shéepe. Wherein albeit they
of Scotland doo somewhat come behind vs, yet their outward defect is
inwardlie recompensed, not onelie with plentie of quarries (and those of
sundrie kinds of marble, hard stone, and fine alabaster) but also rich
mines of mettall, as shall be shewed hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Winds.</span>
In this Iland likewise the winds are commonlie more strong and fierce,
than in anie other places of the maine, which Cardane also espied: and
that is often séene vpon the naked hilles, not garded with trées to
beare and kéepe it off. That grieuous inconuenience also inforceth our
<span class="leftnote">Building.</span>
nobilitie, gentrie, and communaltie, to build their houses in the
vallies, leauing the high grounds vnto their corne and cattell, least
the cold and stormie blasts of winter should bréed them greater
annoiance: whereas in other regions each one desireth to set his house
aloft on the hill, not onlie to be seene a farre off, and cast forth his
beames of statelie and curious workemanship into euerie quarter of the
countrie; but also (in hot habitations) for coldnesse sake of the aire,
sith the heat is neuer so vehement on the hill top as in the vallie,
because the reuerberation of the sunne beames either reacheth not so
farre as the highest, or else becommeth not so strong as when it is
reflected upon the lower soile.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Husbandrie amended.</span>
But to leaue our buildings vnto the purposed place (which
notwithstanding haue verie much increased, I meane for curiositie and
cost, in England, Wales, and Scotland, within these few yeares) and to
returne to the soile againe. Certeinelie it is euen now in these our
daies growne to be much more fruitfull, than it hath béene in times
past. The cause is for that our countriemen are growne to be more
painefull, skilfull, and carefull through recompense of gaine, than
heretofore they haue béene: insomuch that my Synchroni or time fellows
can reape at this present great commoditie in a little roome; whereas of
late yeares, a great compasse hath yéelded but small profit, and this
onelie through the idle and negligent occupation of such, as dailie
manured and had the same in occupieng. I might set downe examples of
these things out of all the parts of this Iland, that is to saie, manie
of England, more out of Scotland, but most of all out of Wales: in which
two last rehearsed, verie little other food and liuelihood was wont to
be looked for (beside flesh) more than the soile of it selfe, and the
cow gaue; the people in the meane time liuing idelie, dissolutelie, and
by picking and stealing one from another. All which vices are now (for
the most part) relinquished, so that each nation manureth hir owne with
triple commoditie, to that it was before time.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Pasture.</span>
The pasture of this Iland is according to the nature and bountie of the
soile, whereby in most places it is plentifull, verie fine, batable, and
such as either fatteth our cattell with speed, or yéeldeth great
abundance of milke and creame: whereof the yellowest butter and finest
chéese are made. But where the blue claie aboundeth (which hardlie
drinketh vp the winters water in long season) there the grasse is
spearie, rough, and verie apt for brushes: by which occasion it commeth
nothing so profitable vnto the owner as the other. The best pasture
ground of all England is in Wales, &amp; of all the pasture in Wales that of
Cardigan is the cheefe. I speake of the same which is to be found in the
<span class="page"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[Page 185]</span>
mounteines there, where the hundred part of the grasse growing is not
eaten, but suffered to rot on the ground, whereby the soile becommeth
matted, and diuerse bogges and quicke moores made withall in long
continuance: because all the cattell in the countrie are not able to eat
it downe. If it be to be accompted good soile, on which a man may laie a
wand ouer night, and on the morrow find it hidden and ouergrowen with
grasse: it is not hard to find plentie thereof in manie places of this
land. Neuertheless, such is the fruitfulnes of the aforsaid countie that
it farre surmounteth this proportion, whereby it may be compared for
batablenesse with Italie, which in my time is called the paradise of the
world, although by reason of the wickednesse of such as dwell therein it
may be called the sinke and draine of hell: so that whereas they were
woont to saie of vs that our land is good but our people euill, they did
but onlie speake it; whereas we know by experience that the soile of
Italie is a noble soile, but the dwellers therein farre off from anie
vertue or goodnesse.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Medowes.</span>
Our medowes, are either bottomes (whereof we haue great store, and those
verie large, bicause our soile is hillie) or else such as we call land
meads, and borowed from the best &amp; fattest pasturages. The first of them
are yearelie &amp; often ouerflowen by the rising of such streames as passe
through the same, or violent falles of land-waters, that descend from
the hils about them. The other are seldome or neuer ouerflowen, and that
is the cause wherefore their grasse is shorter than that of the
bottomes, and yet is it farre more fine, wholesome, and batable, sith
the haie of our low medowes is not onelie full of sandie cinder, which
breedeth sundrie diseases in our cattell, but also more rowtie, foggie,
and full of flags, and therefore not so profitable for stouer and
forrage as the higher meads be. The difference furthermore in their
commodities is great, for whereas in our land meadowes we haue not often
aboue one good load of haie, or peraduenture a little more in an acre of
ground (I vse the word Carrucata or Carruca which is a waine load, and,
as I remember, vsed by Plinie lib. 33. cap. 11.) in low meadowes we haue
sometimes thrée, but commonlie two or vpward, as experience hath oft
confirmed.</p>

<p>Of such as are twise mowed I speake not, sith their later math is not so
wholesome for cattell as the first; although in the mouth more pleasant
for the time: for thereby they become oftentimes to be rotten, or to
increase so fast in bloud, that the garget and other diseases doo
consume manie of them before the owners can séeke out any remedie, by
Phlebotomie or otherwise. Some superstitious fooles suppose that they
which die of the garget are ridden with the night mare, and therefore
they hang vp stones which naturallie haue holes in them, and must be
found vnlooked for; as if such a stone were an apt cockeshot for the
diuell to run through and solace himselfe withall, whilest the cattell
go scot free and are not molested by him. But if I should set downe but
halfe the toies that superstition hath brought into our husbandmens
heads in this and other behalfes, it would aske a greater volume than is
conuenient for such a purpose, wherefore it shall suffice to haue said
thus much of these things.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Corne.</span>
The yéeld of our corne-ground is also much after this rate folowing.
Through out the land (if you please to make an estimat thereof by the
acre) in meane and indifferent yeares, wherein each acre of rie or
wheat, well tilled and dressed, will yeeld commonlie sixtéene or twentie
bushels, an acre of barlie six and thirtie bushels, of otes and such
like foure or fiue quarters, which proportion is notwithstanding oft
abated toward the north, as it is oftentimes surmounted in the south. Of
mixed corne, as peason and beanes, sowen togither, tares and otes (which
they call bulmong) rie and wheat named miscelin here is no place to
speake, yet their yéeld is neuerthelesse much after this proportion, as
I haue often marked. And yet is not this our great foison comparable to
that of hoter countries of the maine. But of all that euer I read, the
increase which Eldred Danus writeth of in his De imperio Iudæorum in
Aethiopia surmounteth, where he saith that in the field néere to the
Sabbatike riuer, called in old time Gosan, the ground is so fertile,
that euerie graine of barleie growing dooth yéeld an hundred kernels at
the least vnto the owner.</p>

<p>Of late yeares also we haue found and taken vp a great trade in planting
<span class="page"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[Page 186]</span>
of hops, whereof our moorie hitherto and vnprofitable grounds doo yeeld
such plentie &amp; increase, that their are few farmers or occupiers in the
countrie, which haue not gardens and hops growing of their owne, and
those farre better than doo come from Flanders vnto us. Certes the
corruptions vsed by the Flemings, and forgerie dailie practised in this
kind of ware, gaue vs occasion to plant them here at home: so that now
we may spare and send manie ouer vnto them. And this I know by
experience, that some one man by conuersion of his moorie grounds into
hopyards, wherof before he had no commoditie, dooth raise yearelie by so
little as twelue acres in compasse two hundred markes; all charges borne
toward the maintenance of his familie. Which industrie God continue!
though some secret fréends of Flemings let not to exclaime against this
commoditie, as a spoile of wood, by reason of the poles, which
neuerthelesse after three yeares doo also come to the fire, and spare
their other fewell.</p>

<p>
The cattell which we breed are commonlie such, as for greatnesse of
<span class="leftnote">Cattell.</span>
bone, swéetnesse of flesh, and other benefits to be reaped by the same,
giue place vnto none other: as may appeare first by our oxen, whose
largenesse, height, weight, tallow, hides, and hornes are such, as none
of anie other nation doo commonlie or may easilie excéed them. Our
shéepe likewise for good tast of flesh, quantitie of lims, finesse of
fléece caused by their hardnesse of pasturage, and abundance of increase
(for in manie places they bring foorth two or thrée at an eaning) giue
no place vnto anie, more than doo our goates, who in like sort doo
follow the same order, and our déere come not behind. As for our conies,
<span class="leftnote">Meall and Disnege.</span>
I haue séene them so fat in some soiles, especiallie about Meall and
Disnege, that the grease of one being weighed, hath peised verie néere
six or seuen ounces. All which benefits we first refer to the grace and
goodnesse of God, and next of all vnto the bountie of our soile, which
he hath indued with so notable and commodious fruitfulnesse.</p>

<p>But as I meane to intreat of these things more largelie hereafter, so
will I touch in this place one benefit which our nation wanteth, and
<span class="leftnote">Wine.</span>
that is wine; the fault whereof is not in our soile, but the negligence
of our countriemen (especiallie of the south partes) who doo not inure
the same to this commoditie, and which by reason of long discontinuance,
is now become vnapt to beare anie grapes almost for pleasure &amp; shadow,
much lesse then the plaine fields or seuerall vineyards for aduantage
and commoditie. Yet of late time some haue assaied to deale for wine, as
to your lordship also is right well knowen. But sith that liquor when it
commeth to the drinking hath bin found more hard, than that which is
brought from beyond the sea, and the cost of planting and keeping
thereof so chargeable, that they may buie it far better cheape from
other countries: they haue giuen ouer their enterprises without anie
consideration, that as in all other things, so neither the ground it
selfe in the beginning, nor successe of their trauell can answer their
expectation at the first, vntill such time as the soile be brought as it
were into acquaintance with this commoditie, and that prouision may be
made for the more easinesse of charge, to be imploied vpon the same.</p>

<p>If it be true, that where wine dooth last and indure well, there it will
grow no worse: I muse not a little wherefore the planting of vines
should be neglected in England. That this liquor might haue growne in
this Iland heretofore, first the charter that Probus the emperour gaue
equallie to vs, the Galles, and Spaniards, is one sufficient testimonie.
And that it did grow here, beside the testimonie of Beda lib. 1. cap. 1.
the old notes of tithes for wine that yet remaine in the accompts of
some parsons and vicars in Kent, &amp; elsewhere, besides the records of
sundrie sutes, commensed in diuerse ecclesiasticall courts, both in
Kent, Surrie, &amp;c: also the inclosed parcels almost in euerie abbeie yet
called the vineyardes, may be a notable witnesse, as also the plot which
we now call east Smithfield in London giuen by Canutus sometime king of
this land, with other soile there about vnto certeine of his knights,
with the libertie of a Guild which therof was called Knighten Guild. The
truth is (saith Iohn Stow our countrie man, and diligent traueller in
the old estate of this my natiue citie) that it is now named Port soken
ward, and giuen in time past to the religious house within Algate.
Howbeit first Otwell, the Archouell, Otto, &amp; finallie Geffrie erle of
Essex constables of the Tower of London, withheld that portion fr&#333;
the said house, vntill the reigne of king Stephan, and thereof made a
<span class="page"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[Page 187]</span>
vineyard to their great commoditie and lucre. The Ile of Elie also was
in the first times of the Normans called Le Ile des vignes. And good
record appéereth, that the bishop there had yearelie thrée or foure
tunne at the least giuen him Nomine decimæ, beside whatsoeuer ouer-summe
of the liquor did accrue to him by leases and other excheats, whereof
also I haue seene mention. Wherefore our soile is not to be blamed, as
though our nights were so exceeding short, that in August and September
the moone which is ladie of moisture, &amp; chiefe ripener of this liquor,
cannot in anie wise shine long inough vpon the same: a verie méere toie
and fable right worthie to be suppressed, because experience conuinceth
the vpholders thereof euen in the Rhenish wines.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Wad.</span>
The time hath béene also that wad, wherwith our countrie men died their
faces (as Cæsar saith) that they might séeme terrible to their enimies
in the field, and also women &amp; their daughters in law did staine their
bodies &amp; go naked, in that pickle to the sacrifices of their gods,
coueting to resemble therin the Ethiopians, as Plinie saith li. 22. cap.
<span class="leftnote">Madder.</span>
1. and also madder haue béene (next vnto our tin and woolles) the chiefe
<span class="rightnote">Rape.</span>]
commodities, and merchandize of this realme. I find also that rape oile
hath beene made within this land. But now our soile either will not or
at the leastwise may not beare either wad or madder: I saie not that the
ground is not able so to doo, but that we are negligent, afraid of the
pilling of our grounds, and carelesse of our owne profit, as men rather
willing to buie the same of others than take anie paine to plant them
<span class="leftnote">Flax.</span>
here at home. The like I may saie of flax, which by law ought to be
sowen in euerie countrie-towne in England, more or lesse: but I sée no
successe of that good and wholesome law, sith it is rather
contemptuouslie reiected than otherwise dutifullie kept in anie place of
England.</p>

<p>Some saie that our great number of lawes doo bréed a generall negligence
and contempt of all good order; bicause we haue so manie, that no
subiect can liue without the transgression of some of them, and that the
often alteration of our ordinances dooth much harme in this respect,
which (after Aristotle) doth séeme to carie some reason withall, for (as
Cornelius Gallus hath:)<br /><span class="leftnote">Eleg. 2.</span></p>

<p class="ind1">Euentus varios res noua semper habet.</p>

<p>But verie manie let not to affirme, that the gréedie corruption of the
promoters on the one side, facilitie in dispensing with good lawes, and
first breach of the same in the lawmakers &amp; superiors, &amp; priuat respects
of their establishment on the other, are the greatest causes whie the
inferiours regard no good order, being alwaies so redie to offend
without anie facultie one waie, as they are otherwise to presume, vpon
<span class="rightnote">Principis longè magis exemplo quion culpa peccare solent.</span>
the examples of their betters when anie hold is to be taken. But as in
these things I haue no skill, so I wish that fewer licences for the
priuat commoditie but of a few were granted (not that thereby I denie
the maintenance of the prerogatiue roiall, but rather would with all my
hart that it might be yet more honorablie increased) &amp; that euerie one
which by féeed friendship (or otherwise) dooth attempt to procure oughts
from the prince, that may profit but few and proue hurtfull to manie,
might be at open assizes and sessions denounced enimie to his countrie
and commonwealth of the land.</p>
<p>
Glasse also hath beene made here in great plentie before, and in the
time of the Romans; and the said stuffe also, beside fine scissers,
shéeres, collars of gold and siluer for womens necks, cruses and cups of
amber, were a parcell of the tribute which Augustus in his daies laid
vpon this Iland. In like sort he charged the Britons with certeine
implements and vessels of iuorie (as Strabo saith.) Wherby it appéereth
that in old time our countriemen were farre more industrious and
painefull in the vse and application of the benefits of their countrie,
than either after the comming of the Saxons or Normans, in which they
gaue themselues more to idlenesse and following of the warres.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Earth.</span>
If it were requisit that I should speake of the sundrie kinds of moold,
as the cledgie or claie, whereof are diuerse sorts (red, blue, blacke
and white) also the red or white sandie, the lomie, rosellie, grauellie,
chalkie or blacke, I could saie that there are so manie diuerse veines
in Britaine, as else where in anie quarter of like quantitie in the
<span class="page"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[Page 188]</span>
world. Howbeit this I must néeds confesse, that the sandie and cledgie
doo beare great swaie: but the claie most of all, as hath beene, and yet
is alwaies séene &amp; felt through plentie and dearth of corne. For if this
latter (I meane the claie) doo yeeld hir full increase (which it dooth
commonlie in drie yeares for wheat) then is there generall plentie:
wheras if it faile, then haue we scarsitie, according to the old rude
verse set downe of England, but to be vnderstood of the whole Iland, as
experience dooth confirme:</p>

<p class="ind1">When the sand dooth serue the claie,<br />
Then may we sing well awaie,<br />
But when the claie dooth serue the sand,<br />
Then is it merie with England.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Vallies.</span>
I might here intreat of the famous vallies in England, of which one is
called the vale of White horsse, another of Eouesham, commonlie taken
for the granarie of Worcestershire, the third of Ailesbirie that goeth
by Tame, the rootes of Chilterne hils, to Donstable, Newport panell,
Stonie Stratford, Buckhingham, Birstane parke, &amp;c. Likewise of the
fourth of Whitehart or Blackemoore in Dorsetshire. The fift of Ringdale
or Renidale, corruptlie called Ringtaile, that lieth (as mine author
saith) vpon the edge of Essex and Cambridgeshire, and also the Marshwood
vale: but for somuch as I know not well their seuerall limits, I giue
ouer to go anie further in their description. In like sort it should not
<span class="leftnote">Fennes.</span>
be amisse to speake of our fennes, although our countrie be not so full
of this kind of soile as the parties beyond the seas, to wit, Narbon,
&amp;c: and thereto of other pleasant botoms, the which are not onelie
indued with excellent riuers and great store of corne and fine fodder
for neat and horsses in time of the yeare (whereby they are excéeding
beneficiall vnto their owners) but also of no small compasse and
quantitie in ground. For some of our fens are well knowen to be either
of ten, twelue, sixtéene, twentie, or thirtie miles in length, that of
the Girwies yet passing all the rest, which is full 60 (as I haue often
read.) Wherein also Elie the famous Ile standeth, which is seuen miles
euerie waie, and wherevnto there is no accesse but by thrée causies,
whose inhabitants in like sort by an old priuilege may take wood, sedge,
turfe, &amp;c; to burne: likewise haie for their cattell, and thatch for
their houses of custome, and each occupier in his appointed quantitie
through out the Ile; albeit that couetousnesse hath now begun somewhat
to abridge this large beneuolence and commoditie, aswell in the said Ile
as most other places of this land.</p>
<p>
Finallie, I might discourse in like order of the large commons,
<span class="leftnote">Commons.</span>
laid out heretofore by the lords of the soiles for the benefit of such poore, as
inhabit within the compasse of their manors. But as the true intent of
the giuers is now in most places defrauded, in so much that not the
poore tenants inhabiting vpon the same, but their landlords haue all the
commoditie and gaine, so the tractation of them belongeth rather to the
second booke. Wherfore I meane not at this present to deale withall, but
reserue the same wholie vnto the due place whilest I go forward with the
rest; setting downe neuerthelesse by the waie a generall commendation of
the whole Iland, which I find in an ancient monument, much vnto this
effect.</p>

<small>OF THE FOURE HIGH WAIES SOMETIME MADE IN BRITAINE BY THE PRINCES OF <br />THIS ILAND.</small><br />

CAP. XIX.</h3>

<p>There are, which indeuoring to bring all things to their Saxon
originall, doo affirme, that this diuision of waies, (whereof we now
intreat) should apperteine vnto such princes of that nation as reigned
here, since the Romanes gaue vs ouer: and herevpon they inferre, that
Wattling street was builded by one Wattle from the east vnto the west.
But how weake their coniectures are in this behalfe, the antiquitie of
these streets it selfe shall easilie declare, whereof some parcelles,
after a sort, are also set downe by Antoninus; and those that haue
written of the seuerall iournies from hence to Rome: although
peraduenture not in so direct an order as they were at the first
established. For my part, if it were not that I desire to be short in
this behalfe, I could with such notes as I haue alreadie collected for
that purpose, make a large confutation of diuerse of their opinions
concerning these passages, and thereby rather ascribe the originall of
these waies to the Romans than either the British or Saxon princes. But
sith I haue spent more time in the tractation of the riuers than was
allotted vnto me, and that I sée great cause (notwithstanding my late
alledged scruple) wherfore I should hold with our Galfride before anie
other; I will omit at this time to discourse of these things as I would,
and saie what I maie for the better knowledge of their courses,
procéeding therein as followeth.</p>

<p>First of all I find, that Dunwallon king of Britaine, about 483 yeares
before the birth of our sauiour Iesus Christ, séeing the subiects of his
realme to be in sundrie wise oppressed by théeues and robbers as they
trauelled to and fro; and being willing (so much as in him laie) to
redresse these inconueniences, caused his whole kingdome to be surueied;
and then commanding foure principall waies to be made, which should
leade such as trauelled into all parts thereof, from sea to sea, he gaue
sundrie large priuileges vnto the same, whereby they became safe, and
verie much frequented. And as he had regard herein to the securitie of
his subiects, so he made sharpe lawes grounded vpon iustice, for the
suppression of such wicked members as did offer violence to anie
traueler that should be met withall or found within the limits of those
passages. How and by what parts of this Iland these waies were conueied
at the first, it is not so wholie left in memorie: but that some
question is mooued among the learned, concerning their ancient courses.
Howbeit such is the shadow remaining hitherto of their extensions, that
if not at this present perfectlie, yet hereafter it is not vnpossible,
but that they may be found out, &amp; left certeine vnto posteritie. It
seemeth by Galfride, that the said Dunwallon did limit out those waies
by dooles and markes, which being in short time altered by the auarice
of such irreligious persons as dwelt néere, and incroched vpon the same
(a fault yet iustlie to be found almost in euerie place, euen in the
time of our most gratious and souereigne Ladie Elizabeth, wherein the
lords of the soiles doo vnite their small occupieng, onelie to increase
a greater proportion of rent; and therefore they either remooue, or giue
licence to erect small tenements vpon the high waies sides and commons;
wherevnto, in truth, they haue no right: and yet out of them also doo
raise a new commoditie) and question mooued for their bounds before
Belinus his sonne, he to auoid all further controuersie that might from
thencefoorth insue, caused the same to be paued with hard stone of
eightéene foot in breadth, ten foot in depth, and in the bottome thereof
huge flint stones also to be pitched, least the earth in time should
swallow vp his workemanship, and the higher ground ouer-grow their
rising crests. He indued them also with larger priuileges than before,
protesting that if anie man whosoeuer should presume to infringe his
peace, and violate the lawes of his kingdome in anie maner of wise,
neere vnto or vpon those waies, he should suffer such punishment without
all hope to escape (by freendship or mercie) as by the statutes of this
realme latelie prouided in those cases were due vnto the offendors. The
<span class="page"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[Page 190]</span>
names of these foure waies are the Fosse, the Gwethelin or Watling, the
Erming, and the Ikenild.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Fosse.</span>
The Fosse goeth not directlie but slopewise ouer the greatest part of
this Iland, beginning at Dotnesse or Totnesse in Deuonshire, where Brute
somtime landed, or (as Ranulphus saith, which is more likelie) at the
point of Cornwall, though the eldest writers doo séeme to note the
contrarie. From hence it goeth thorough the middle of Deuonshire &amp;
Summersetshire, and commeth to Bristow, from whence it runneth
manifestlie to Sudberie market, Tetburie, and so foorth holdeth on as
you go almost to the midde waie betweene Glocester and Cirnecester,
(where the wood faileth, and the champeigne countrie appeareth toward
Cotteswald) streight as a line vntill you come to Cirnecester it selfe.
Some hold opinion that the waie, which lieth from Cirnecester to Bath,
should be the verie Fosse; and that betwixt Cirnecester and Glocester to
be another of the foure waies, made by the Britons. But ancient report
grounded vpon great likelihood, and confirmed also by some experience,
iudgeth that most of the waies crossed ech other in this part of the
realme. And of this mind is Leland also, who learned it of an abbat of
Cirnecester that shewed great likelihood by some records thereof. But to
procéed. From Cirnecester, it goeth by Chepingnorton to Couentrie,
Leircester, Newarke, and so to Lincolne ouerthwart the Watlingstreet:
where, by generall consent of all the writers (except Alfred of
Beuerleie, who extendeth it vnto Cathnesse in Scotland) it is said to
haue an end.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Watling stréet.</span>
The Watlingstréete begun (as I said) by Dunwallo, but finished by
Gutheline, of whome it is directlie to be called Gutheline stréet,
though now corrupted into Watlingstréet, beginneth at Douer in Kent, and
so stretcheth through the middest of Kent vnto London, and so foorth
(peraduenture by the middest of the citie) vnto Verolamium or
Verlamcester, now saint Albons, where, in the yeare of grace, one
thousand fiue hundred thirtie &amp; one, the course thereof was found by a
man that digged for grauell wherwith to mend the high waie. It was in
this place eighteene foot broad, and about ten foot déepe, and stoned in
the bottome in such wise as I haue noted afore, and peraduenture also on
the top: but these are gone, and the rest remaine equall in most places,
and leuell with the fields. The yelow grauell also that was brought
thither in carts two thousand yéeres passed, remained there so fresh and
so strong, as if it had béene digged out of the naturall place where it
grew not manie yéeres before. From hence it goeth hard by Margate,
leauing it on the west side. And a little by south of this place, where
the priorie stood, is a long thorough fare vpon the said street, méetly
well builded (for low housing) on both sides. After this it procéedeth
(as the chronicle of Barnwell saith) to Caxton, and so to Huntingdon, &amp;
then forward, still winding in and out till it not onelie becommeth a
bound vnto Leicestershire toward Lugbie, but also passeth from
Castleford to Stamford, and so foorth by west of Marton, which is but a
mile from Torkeseie.</p>

<p>Here by the waie I must touch the opinion of a traueller of my time, who
noteth the said stréet to go another waie, insomuch that he would haue
it to crosse the third Auon, betwixt Newton and Dowbridge, and so go on
to Binford bridge, Wibtoft, the High crosse, and thence to Atherston
vpon Ancre. Certes it may be, that the Fosse had his course by the
countrie in such sort as he describeth; but that the Watlingstréet
should passe by Atherston, I cannot as yet be persuaded. Neuerthelesse
his coniecture is not to be misliked, sith it is not vnlikelie that
thrée seuerall waies might méet at Alderwaie (a towne vpon Tame, beneath
Salters bridge) for I doo not doubt that the said towne did take his
name of all three waies, as Aldermarie church in London did of all thrée
Maries, vnto whom it hath béene dedicated: but that the Watlingstréet
should be one of them, the compasse of his passage will in no wise
permit. And thus much haue I thought good to note by the waie. Now to
returne againe to Leland, and other mens collections.</p>

<p>The next tidings that we heare of the Watlingstréet, are that it goeth
thorough or neere by the parke at Pomfret, as the common voice also of
the countrie confirmeth. Thence it passeth hastilie ouer Castelford
bridge to Aberford, which is fiue miles from thence, and where are most
<span class="page"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[Page 191]</span>
manifest tokens of this stréet and his broad crest by a great waie
togither, also to Yorke, to Witherbie, and then to Borowbridge, where on
the left hand thereof stood certeine monuments, or pyramides of stone,
sometimes placed there by the ancient Romanes. These stones (saith
Leland) stand eight miles west from Bowis, and almost west from Richmond
is a little thorough fare called Maiden castell, situate apparantlie
vpon the side of this stréet. And here is one of those pyramides or
great round heapes, which is three score foot compasse in the bottome.
There are other also of lesse quantities, and on the verie top of ech of
them are sharpe stones of a yard in length; but the greatest of all is
eighteene foot high at the least, from the ground to the verie head. He
addeth moreouer, how they stand on an hill in the edge of Stanes moore,
and are as bounds betwéene Richmondshire, and Westmerland. But to
procéed. This stréet lieng a mile from Gilling, and two miles from
Richmond commeth on from Borowbridge to Catericke, eightéene miles; that
is, twelue to Leuing, &amp; six to Catericke; then eleuen miles to Greteie
or Gritto, fiue miles to Bottles, eight miles to Burgh on Stanes moore,
foure miles from Applebie, and fiue to Browham, where the said stréet
commeth thorough Winfoll parke, and ouer the bridge on Eiemouth and
Loder, and leauing Perith a quarter of a mile or more on the west side
of it, goeth to Carleill seuenteene miles from Browham, which hath béene
some notable thing. Hitherto it appeareth euidentlie, but going from
hence into Scotland, I heare no more of it, vntill I come to Cathnesse,
which is two hundred and thirtie miles or thereabouts out of England.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Erming stréet.</span>
The Erming stréet, which some call the Lelme, stretcheth out of the
east, as they saie, into the southeast, that is, from Meneuia or S.
Dauids in Wales vnto Southampton, whereby it is somewhat likelie indeed
that these two waies, I meane the Fosse and the Erming, should méet
about Cirnecester, as it commeth from Glocester, according to the
opinion conceiued of them in that countrie. Of this waie I find no more
written, and therefore I can saie no more of it, except I should indeuor
to driue awaie the time, in alleging what other men say thereof, whose
minds doo so farre disagrée one from another, as they doo all from a
truth, and therefore I giue them ouer as not delighting in such dealing.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Ikenild.</span>
The Ikenild or Rikenild began somewhere in the south, and so held on
toward Cirnecester, then to Worcester, Wicombe, Brimcham, Lichfield,
Darbie, Chesterfield; and crossing the Watlingstréet somewhere in
Yorkeshire, stretched foorth in the end vnto the mouth of the Tine,
where it ended at the maine sea, as most men doo confesse. I take it to
be called the Ikenild, because it passed thorough the kingdome of the
Icenes. For albeit that Leland &amp; other following him doo séeme to place
the Icenes in Norffolke and Suffolke; yet in mine opinion that can not
well be doone, sith it is manifest by Tacitus, that they laie néere vnto
the Silures, and (as I gesse) either in Stafford and Worcester shires,
or in both, except my coniecture doo faile me. The author of the booke,
intituled Eulogium historiarum, doth call this stréet the Lelme. But as
herein he is deceiued, so haue I dealt withall so faithfullie as I may
among such diuersitie of opinions; yet not denieng but that there is
much confusion in the names and courses of these two latter, the
discussing whereof I must leaue to other men that are better learned
than I.</p>

<p>Now to speake generallie of our common high waies through the English
part of the Ile (for of the rest I can saie nothing) you shall
vnderstand that in the claie or cledgie soile they are often verie déepe
and troublesome in the winter halfe. Wherfore by authoritie of parlement
an order is taken for their yearelie amendment, whereby all sorts of the
common people doo imploie their trauell for six daies in summer vpon the
same. And albeit that the intent of the statute is verie profitable for
the reparations of the decaied places, yet the rich doo so cancell their
portions, and the poore so loiter in their labours, that of all the six,
scarcelie two good days works are well performed and accomplished in a
parish on these so necessarie affaires. Besides this, such as haue land
lieng vpon the sides of the waies, doo vtterlie neglect to dich and
scowre their draines and watercourses, for better auoidance of the
winter waters (except it may be set off or cut from the meaning of the
<span class="page"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[Page 192]</span>
statute) whereby the stréets doo grow to be much more gulled than
before, and thereby verie noisome for such as trauell by the same.
Sometimes also, and that verie often, these daies works are not imploied
vpon those waies that lead from market to market, but ech surueior
amendeth such by-plots &amp; lanes as séeme best for his owne commoditie,
and more easie passage vnto his fields and pastures. And whereas in some
places there is such want of stones, as thereby the inhabitants are
driuen to seeke them farre off in other soiles: the owners of the lands
wherein those stones are to be had, and which hitherto haue giuen monie
to haue them borne awaie, doo now reape no small commoditie by raising
the same to excessiue prices, whereby their neighbours are driuen to
grieuous charges, which is another cause wherefore the meaning of that
good law is verie much defrauded. Finallie, this is another thing
likewise to be considered of, that the trées and bushes growing by the
stréets sides; doo not a little keepe off the force of the sunne in
summer for drieng vp of the lanes. Wherefore if order were taken that
their boughs should continuallie be kept short, and the bushes not
suffered to spread so far into the narrow paths, that inconuenience
would also be remedied, and manie a slough proue hard ground that yet is
déepe and hollow. Of the dailie incroaching of the couetous vpon the hie
waies I speake not. But this I know by experience, that wheras some
stréets within these fiue and twentie yeares haue béene in most places
fiftie foot broad according to the law, whereby the traueller might
either escape the théefe or shift the mier, or passe by the loaden cart
without danger of himselfe and his horsse; now they are brought vnto
twelue, or twentie, or six and twentie at the most, which is another
cause also whereby the waies be the worse, and manie an honest man
encombred in his iourneie. But what speake I of these things whereof I
doo not thinke to heare a iust redresse, because the error is so common,
and the benefit thereby so swéet and profitable to manie, by such houses
and cotages as are raised vpon the same.</p>

<small>OF THE GENERALL CONSTITUTION OF THE BODIES OF THE BRITONS.</small><br />

CHAP. XX.</h3>

<p>Such as are bred in this Iland are men for the most part of a good
complexion, tall of stature, strong in bodie, white of colour, and
thereto of great boldnesse and courage in the warres. As for their
generall comelinesse of person, the testimonie of Gregorie the great, at
such time as he saw English capteins sold at Rome, shall easilie
confirme what it is, which yet dooth differ in sundrie shires and
soiles, as also their proportion of members, as we may perceiue betwéene
Herefordshire and Essex men, or Cambridgeshire and the Londoners for the
one, and Pokington and Sedberrie for the other; these latter being
distinguished by their noses and heads, which commonlie are greater
there than in other places of the land. As concerning the stomachs also
of our nation in the field, they haue alwaies beene in souereigne
admiration among forren princes: for such hath béene the estimation of
our souldiers from time to time, since our Ile hath béene knowne vnto
the Romans, that wheresoeuer they haue serued in forren countries, the
cheefe brunts of seruice haue beene reserued vnto them. Of their
conquests and bloudie battels woone in France, Germanie, and Scotland,
our histories are full: &amp; where they haue beene ouercome, the victorers
themselues confessed their victories to haue béene so déerelie bought,
that they would not gladlie couet to ouercome often, after such
difficult maner. In martiall prowesse, there is little or no difference
betwéene Englishmen and Scots: for albeit that the Scots haue beene
often and verie gréeuouslie ouercome by the force of our nation, it hath
not béene for want of manhood on their parts, but through the mercie of
God shewed on vs, and his iustice vpon them, sith they alwaies haue
begun the quarels, and offered vs méere iniurie with great despite and
crueltie.</p>

<p>Leland noting somewhat of the constitution of our bodies, saith these
<span class="page"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[Page 193]</span>
words grounding (I thinke vpon Aristotle, who writeth that such as dwell
neere the north, are of more courage and strength of bodie than
skilfulnesse or wisdome.) The Britons are white in colour, strong of
bodie, and full of bloud, as people inhabiting neere the north, and
farre from the equinoctiall line, where the soile is not so fruitfull,
and therefore the people not so feeble: whereas contrariwise such as
dwell toward the course of the sunne, are lesse of stature, weaker of
bodie, more nice, delicate, fearefull by nature, blacker in colour, &amp;
some so blacke in déed as anie crow or rauen. Thus saith he. Howbeit, as
those which are bred in sundrie places of the maine, doo come behind vs
in constitution of bodie, so I grant, that in pregnancie of wit,
nimblenesse of limmes, and politike inuentions, they generallie exceed
vs: notwithstanding that otherwise these gifts of theirs doo often
degenerate into méere subtiltie, instabilitie, vnfaithfulnesse, &amp;
crueltie. Yet Alexander ab Alexandro is of the opinion, that the
fertilest region dooth bring foorth the dullest wits, and contrariwise
the harder soile the finest heads. But in mine opinion, the most fertile
soile dooth bring foorth the proudest nature, as we may see by the
Campanians, who (as Cicero also saith) had "Penes eos ipsum domicilium
superbiæ." But nether of these opinions do iustlie take hold of vs, yet
hath it pleased the writers to saie their pleasures of vs. And for that
we dwell northward, we are commonlie taken by the forren
historiographers, to be men of great strength and little policie, much
courage and small shift, bicause of the weake abode of the sunne with
vs, whereby our braines are not made hot and warmed, as Pachymerus
noteth lib. 3: affirming further, that the people inhabiting in the
north parts are white of colour, blockish, vnciuill, fierce and warlike,
which qualities increase, as they come neerer vnto the pole; whereas the
contrarie pole giueth contrarie gifts, blacknesse, wisdome, ciuilitie,
weakenesse, and cowardise, thus saith he. But alas, how farre from
probabilitie or as if there were not one and the same conclusion to be
made of the constitutions of their bodies, which dwell vnder both the
poles. For in truth his assertion holdeth onelie in their persons that
inhabit néere vnto and vnder the equinoctiall. As for the small tariance
of the sunne with vs, it is also confuted by the length of our daies.
<span class="leftnote">Non vi sed virtute, non armis sed ingenio vincuntur Angli.</span>
Wherefore his reason seemeth better to vphold that of Alexander ab
Alexandro afore alledged, than to prooue that we want wit, bicause our
brains are not warmed by the tariance of the sunne. And thus also dooth
Comineus burden vs after a sort in his historie, and after him, Bodinus.
But thanked be God, that all the wit of his countriemen, if it may be
called wit, could neuer compasse to doo so much in Britaine, as the
strength and courage of our Englishmen (not without great wisedome and
forecast) haue brought to passe in France. The Galles in time past
contemned the Romans (saith Cæsar) bicause of the smalnesse of their
stature: howbeit, for all their greatnesse (saith he) and at the first
brunt in the warres, they shew themselues to be but féeble, neither is
their courage of any force to stand in great calamities. Certes in
accusing our wisedome in this sort, he dooth (in mine opinion) increase
our commendation. For if it be a vertue to deale vprightlie with
singlenesse of mind, sincerelie and plainlie, without anie such
suspicious fetches in all our dealing, as they commonlie practise in
their affaires, then are our countrimen to be accompted wise and
vertuous. But if it be a vice to colour craftinesse, subtile practises,
doublenesse, and hollow behauiour, with a cloake of policie, amitie and
wisedome: then are Comineus and his countrimen to be reputed vicious, of
whome this prouerbe hath of old time beene vsed as an eare marke of
their dissimulation,</p>

<p class="ind1">Galli ridendo fidem frangunt. &amp;c.</p>

<p>How these latter points take hold in Italie, I meane not to discusse.
How they are dailie practised in manie places of the maine, &amp; he
accompted most wise and politike, that can most of all dissemble; here
is no place iustlie to determine (neither would I wish my countrimen to
learne anie such wisedome) but that a king of France could saie; "Qui
nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare, <em>or</em> viuere," their owne histories
are testimonies sufficient. Galen, the noble physician, transferring the
forces of our naturall humors from the bodie to the mind, attributeth to
the yellow colour, prudence; to the blacke, constancie; to bloud, mirth;
<span class="page"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[Page 194]</span>
to phlegme, courtesie: which being mixed more or lesse among themselues,
doo yéeld an infinit varietie. By this meanes therefore it commeth to
passe, that he whose nature inclineth generallie to phlegme, cannot but
be courteous: which joined with strength of bodie, and sinceritie of
behauiour (qualities vniuersallie granted to remaine so well in our
nation, as other inhabitants of the north) I cannot see what may be an
hinderance whie I should not rather conclude, that the Britons doo
excell such as dwell in the hoter countries, than for want of craft and
subtilties to come anie whit behind them. It is but vanitie also for
some to note vs (as I haue often heard in common table talke) as
barbarous, bicause we so little regard the shedding of our bloud, and
rather tremble not when we sée the liquor of life to go from vs (I vse
their owne words.) Certes if we be barbarous in their eies, bicause we
be rather inflamed than appalled at our wounds, then are those obiectors
flat cowards in our iudgement: sith we thinke it a great péece of
manhood to stand to our tackling, vntill the last drop, as men that may
spare much bicause we haue much: whereas they hauing lesse are afraid to
lose that little which they haue: as Frontinus also noteth. As for that
which the French write of their owne manhood in their histories, I make
little accompt of it: for I am of the opinion, that as an Italian
writing of his credit; A papist intreating of religion, a Spaniard of
his méekenesse, or a Scot of his manhood, is not to be builded on; no
more is a Frenchman to be trusted in the report of his owne affaires,
wherein he dooth either dissemble or excéed, which is a foule vice in
such as professe to deale vprightlie. Neither are we so hard to
strangers as Horace wold séeme to make vs, sith we loue them so long as
they abuse vs not, &amp; make accompt of them so far foorth as they despise
vs not. And this is generallie to be verified, in that they vse our
priuileges and commodities for diet, apparell and trade of gaine, in so
ample manner as we our selues enioy them: which is not lawfull for vs to
doo in their countries, where no stranger is suffered to haue worke, if
an home-borne be without. But to procéed with our purpose.</p>

<p>With vs (although our good men care not to liue long, but to liue well)
some doo liue an hundred yéers, verie manie vnto foure score: as for
thrée score, it is taken but for our entrance into age, so that in
Britaine no man is said to wax old till he draw vnto thrée score, at
which time God spéed you well commeth in place; as Epaminondas sometime
<span class="leftnote">Salutations according to our ages.</span>
said in mirth, affirming that vntill thirtie yeares of age, You are
welcome is the best salutation; and from thence to thréescore, God kéepe
you; but after thréescore, it is best to saie, God spéed you well: for
at that time we begin to grow toward our iournies end, whereon manie a
one haue verie good leaue to go. These two are also noted in vs (as
things apperteining to the firme constitutions of our bodies) that there
hath not béene séene in anie region so manie carcasses of the dead to
remaine from time to time without corruption as in Britaine: and that
after death by slaughter or otherwise, such as remaine vnburied by foure
or fiue daies togither, are easie to be knowne and discerned by their
fréends and kindred; whereas Tacitus and other complaine of sundrie
nations, saieng, that their bodies are "Tam fluidae substantiæ," that
within certeine houres the wife shall hardlie know hir husband, the
mother hir sonne, or one fréend another after their liues be ended. In
like sort the comelinesse of our liuing bodies doo continue from midle
age (for the most) euen to the last gaspe, speciallie in mankind. And
albeit that our women through bearing of children doo after fortie begin
to wrinkle apace, yet are they not commonlie so wretched and hard
fauoured to looke vpon in their age, as the French women, and diuerse of
other countries with whom their men also doo much participate; and
thereto be so often waiward and peeuish, that nothing in maner may
content them.</p>

<p>I might here adde somewhat also of the meane stature generallie of our
women, whose beautie commonlie excéedeth the fairest of those of the
maine, their comlinesse of person and good proportion of limmes, most of
theirs that come ouer vnto vs from beyond the seas. This neuerthelesse I
vtterlie mislike in the poorer sort of them, for the wealthier doo
sildome offend herein: that being of themselues without gouernement,
they are so carelesse in the education of their children (wherein their
husbands are also to be blamed) by means whereof verie manie of them
<span class="page"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[Page 195]</span>
neither fearing God, neither regarding either maners or obedience, doo
oftentimes come to confusion, which (if anie correction or discipline
had béene vsed toward them in youth) might haue prooued good members of
their common-wealth &amp; countrie, by their good seruice and industrie. I
could make report likewise of the naturall vices and vertues of all
those that are borne within this Iland, but as the full tractation herof
craueth a better head than mine to set foorth the same, so will I giue
place to other men that list to take it in hand. Thus much therefore of
the constitutions of our bodies: and so much may suffice.</p>

<small>HOW BRITAINE AT THE FIRST GREW TO BE DIUIDED INTO THREE PORTIONS.</small><br />

CAP. XXI.</h3>

<p>After the comming of Brutus into this Iland (which was, as you haue read
in the foresaid treatise, about the yeare of the world, 2850, or 1217
before the incarnation of Christ, although Goropius after his maner doo
vtterlie denie our historie in this behalfe) he made a generall surueie
of the whole Iland from side to side, by such means to view and search
out not onelie the limits and bounds of his dominions, but also what
commodities this new atchiued conquest might yéeld vnto his people.
Furthermore, finding out at the last also a conuenable place wherin to
erect a citie, he began there euen the verie same which at this daie is
called London, naming it Trenouanton, in remembrance of old Troie, from
whence his ancestors proceeded, and for which the Romans pronounced
afterward Trinobantum, although the Welshmen doo call it still
Trenewith. This citie was builded (as some write) much about the tenth
yeare of his reigne, so that he liued not aboue fiftéene yeares after he
had finished the same. But of the rest of his other acts attempted and
doone, before or after the erection of this citie, I find no certeine
report, more than that when he had reigned in this Iland after his
arriuall by the space of foure and twentie yeares, he finished his daies
at Trenouanton aforesaid, being in his yoong and florishing age, where
his carcase was honourablie interred. As for the maner of his death, I
find as yet no mention thereof among such writers as are extant; I meane
whether it grew vnto him by defect of nature, or force of gréeuous
wounds receiued in his warres against such as withstood him from time to
time in this Iland, and therefore I can saie nothing of that matter.
Herein onelie all agree, that during the time of his languishing paines,
he made a disposition of his whole kingdome, diuiding it into three
parts or portions, according to the number of his sonnes then liuing,
whereof the eldest excéeded not eight and twentie yeares of age, as my
coniecture giueth me.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Locrine.</span>
To the eldest therefore, whose name was Locrine, he gaue the greatest
and best region of all the rest, which of him to this daie is called
<span class="rightnote">Lhoegria.</span>
Lhoegres among the Britons, but in our language England: of such English
Saxons as made conquest of the same. This portion also is included on
the south with the British sea, on the est with the Germane Ocean, on
the north with the Humber, and on the west with the Irish sea, and the
riuers Dee and Sauerne, whereof in the generall description of this
<span class="leftnote">Camber.<br />
Cambri.</span>
Iland I haue spoken more at large. To Camber his second sonne he
assigned all that lieth beyond the Sauerne and Dée, toward the west
(which parcell in these daies conteineth Southwales and Northwales) with
sundrie Ilands adiacent to the same, the whole being in maner cut off
and separated from England or Lhoegria by the said streams, wherby it
séemeth also a peninsula or by-land, if you respect the small hillie
portion of ground that lieth indifferentlie betwéene their maine
courses, or such branches (at the least) as run and fall into them. The
Welshmen or Britons call it by the ancient name still vnto this day, but
we Englishmen terme it Wales: which denomination we haue from the
Saxons, who in time past did vse the word Walsh in such sort as we doo
Strange: for as we call all those strangers that are not of our nation,
so did they name them Walsh which were not of their countrie.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[Page 196]</span></p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Albanact.</span>
The third and last part of the Iland he allotted vnto Albanact his
youngest sonne (for he had but three in all, as I haue said before)
whose portion séemed for circuit to be more large than that of Camber,
and in maner equall in greatnesse with the dominions of Locrinus. But if
you haue regard to the seuerall commodities that are to be reaped by
each, you shall find them to be not much discrepant or differing one
from another: for whatsoeuer the first &amp; second haue in plentie of
corne, fine grasse, and large cattell, this latter wanteth not in
excéeding store of fish, rich mettall, quarries of stone, and abundance
of wild foule: so that in mine opinion, there could not be a more equall
partition than this made by Brute, and after the aforesaid maner. This
later parcell at the first, tooke the name of Albanactus, who called it
Albania. But now a small portion onelie of the region (being vnder the
regiment of a duke) reteineth the said denomination, the rest being
called Scotland, of certeine Scots that came ouer from Ireland to
inhabit in those quarters. It is diuided from Lhoegres also by the Solue
<span class="leftnote">Albania.</span>
and the Firth, yet some doo note the Humber; so that Albania (as Brute
left it) conteined all the north part of the Iland that is to be found
beyond the aforesaid streame, vnto the point of Cathnesse.</p>

<p>To conclude, Brute hauing diuided his kingdome after this maner, and
therein contenting himselfe as it were with the generall title of the
whole, it was not long after yer he ended his life; and being solemnelie
interred at his new citie by his thrée children, they parted each from
other, and tooke possession of their prouinces. But Scotland after two
<span class="leftnote">Locrine king also of Scotland.</span>
yeares fell againe into the hands of Locrinus as to the chiefe lord,
by the death of his brother Albanact, who was slaine by Humber king of
the Scithians, and left none issue behind him to succéed him in that
kingdome.</p>

<small>AFTER WHAT MANER THE SOUEREIGNTIE OF THIS ILE DOOTH REMAINE TO THE <br />PRINCES OF LHOEGRES OR KINGS OF ENGLAND.</small><br />

CHAP. XXII.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">The Scots alwaies desirous to shake off the English
subiection, have often made cruell &amp; odious attempts so to doo, but in
vaine.</span>
It is possible that some of the Scotish nation, reading the former
chapter, will take offence with me for meaning that the principalitie of
the north parts of this Ile hath alwais belonged to the kings of
Lhoegres. For whose more ample satisfaction in this behalfe, I will here
set downe a discourse thereof at large, written by diuerse, and now
finallie brought into one treatise, sufficient (as I thinke) to satisfie
the reasonable, although not halfe enough peraduenture to content a
wrangling mind, sith there is (or at the leastwise hath beene) nothing
more odious among some, than to heare that the king of England hath
ought to doo in Scotland.</p>

<p>How their historiographers haue attempted to shape manie coloured
excuses to auoid so manifest a title, all men may see that read their
bookes indifferentlie, wherevnto I referre them. For my part there is
little or nothing of mine herein, more than onelie the collection and
abridgement of a number of fragments togither, wherein chéeflie I haue
vsed the helpe of Nicholas Adams a lawier, who wrote thereof (of set
purpose) to king Edward the sixt, as Leland did the like to king Henrie
the eight, Iohn Harding vnto Edward the fourth; beside thrée other,
whereof the first dedicated his treatise to Henrie the fourth, the
second to Edward the third, and the third to Edward the first, as their
writings yet extant doo abundantlie beare witnesse. The title also that
Leland giueth his booke, which I haue had written with his owne hand,
beginneth in this maner: "These remembrances following are found in
chronicles authorised, remaining in diuerse monasteries both in England
and Scotland, by which it is euidentlie knowne and shewed, that the
kings of England haue had, and now ought to haue the souereigntie ouer
all Scotland, with the homage and fealtie of the kings there reigning
from time to time, &amp;c." Herevnto you haue heard alreadie, what diuision
Brute made of this Iland not long before his death, wherof ech of his
<span class="page"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[Page 197]</span>
children, so soone as he was interred, tooke seisure and possession.
Howbeit, after two yeares it happened that Albanact was slaine,
wherevpon Locrinus and Camber raising their powers, reuenged his death:
and finallie the said Locrinus made an entrance vpon Albania, seized it
into his owne hands (as excheated wholie vnto himselfe) without yéelding
anie part thereof vnto his brother Camber, who made no claime nor title
vnto anie portion of the same. Hereby then (saith Adams) it euidentlie
appeareth, that the entire seigniorie ouer Albania consisted in
Locrinus, according to which example like law among brethren euer since
hath continued, in preferring the eldest brother to the onelie benefit
of the collaterall ascension from the yongest, as well in Scotland as in
England vnto this daie.</p>

<p>Ebranke the lineall heire from the bodie of this Locrine, that is to
saie, the sonne of Mempris, sonne of Madan, sonne of the same Locrine
builded in Albania the castell of Maidens, now called Edenborough (so
called of Aidan somtime king of Scotland, but at the first named Cair
Minid Agnes. 1. the castell on mount Agnes, and the castell of virgins)
and the castell of Alcluith or Alclude, now called Dunbriton, as the
Scotish Hector Boetius confesseth: whereby it most euidentlie appeareth,
that our Ebranke was then thereof seized. This Ebranke reigned in the
said state ouer them a long time; after whose death Albania (as annexed
to the empire of Britaine) descended to the onelie king of Britons,
vntill the time of the two sisters sonnes, Morgan and Conedage, lineall
heires from the said Ebranke, who brotherlie at the first diuided the
realme betwéen them; so that Morgan had Lhoegres, and Conedage had
Albania. But shortlie after Morgan the elder brother, pondering in his
head the loue of his brother with the affection to a kingdome, excluded
nature, and gaue place to ambition, and therevpon denouncing warre,
death miserablie ended his life (as the reward of his vntruth) whereby
Conedage obteined the whole empire of all Britaine: in which state he
remained during his naturall life.</p>

<p>From him the same lineallie descended to the onelie king of Britons,
vntill (and after) the reigne of Gorbodian, who had issue two sonnes,
Ferrex, and Porrex. This Porrex, requiring like diuision of the land,
affirming the former partitions to be rather of law than fauor, was by
the hands of his elder brother (best loued of queene mother) both of his
life and hoped kingdome béereaued at once. Wherevpon their vnnaturall
mother, vsing hir naturall malice for the death of hir one sonne
(without regard of the loosing of both) miserablie slue the other in his
bed mistrusting no such treason.</p>

<p>Cloten, by all writers, as well Scotish as other, was the next
inheritour to the whole empire: but lacking power (the onelie meane in
those daies to obteine right) he was contented to diuide the same among
foure of his kinsmen; so that Scater had Albania. But after the death of
this Cloten, his sonne Dunwallo Mulmutius made warre vpon these foure
kings, and at last ouercame them, and so recouered the whole dominion.
In token of which victorie, he caused himselfe to be crowned with a
crowne of gold, the verie first of that mettall (if anie at all were
before in vse) that was worne among the kings of this nation. This
Dunwallo erected temples, wherein the people should assemble for praier;
to which temples he gaue benefit of sanctuarie. He made the law for
wager of battell, in cases of murder and felonie, whereby a théefe that
liued and made his art of fighting, should for his purgation fight with
the true man whom he had robbed, beléeuing assuredlie, that the gods
(for then they supposed manie) would by miracle assigne victorie to none
but the innocent partie. Certes the priuileges of this law, and benefit
of the latter, as well in Scotland as in England, be inioied to this
daie, few causes by late positiue laws among vs excepted, wherin the
benefit of wager of battell is restreined. By which obedience to his
lawes, it dooth manifestlie appéere, that this Dunwallo was then seized
of Albania, now called Scotland. This Dunwallo reigned in this estate
ouer them manie yeares.</p>

<p>Beline and Brenne the sonnes also of Dunwallo, did after their fathers
death fauourablie diuide the land betweene them; so that Beline had
Lhoegres, &amp; Brenne had Albania: but for that this Brenne (a subiect)
without the consent of his elder brother and lord, aduentured to marrie
with the daughter of the king of Denmarke; Beline seized Albania into
his owne hands, and thervpon caused the notable waies priuileged by
<span class="page"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[Page 198]</span>
Dunwallons lawes to be newlie wrought by mens hands, which for the
length extended from the further part of Cornewall, vnto the sea by
north Cathnesse in Scotland. In like sort to and for the better
maintenance of religion in those daies, he constituted ministers called
archflamines, in sundrie places of this Iland (who in their seuerall
functions resembled the bishops of our times) the one of which remained
at Ebranke now called Yorke, and the whole region Caerbrantonica
(whereof Ptolomie also speaketh but not without wresting of the name)
whose power extended to the vttermost bounds of Albania, wherby likewise
appeareth that it was then within his owne dominion. After his death the
whole Ile was inioied by the onelie kings of Britaine, vntill the time
of Vigenius &amp; Peridurus lineall heires from the said Beline, who
fauourablie made partition, so that Vigenius had all the land from
Humber by south, and Peridurus from thence northwards all Albania, &amp;c.
This Vigenius died, and Peridurus suruiued, and thereby obteined the
whole, from whom the same quietlie descended, and was by his posteritie
accordinglie inioied, vntill the reigne of Coell the first of that name.
In his time an obscure nation (by most writers supposed Scithians)
passed by seas from Ireland, and arriued in that part of Britaine called
Albania: against whome this Coell assembled his power, and being entred
Albania to expell them, one Fergus in the night disguised, entered the
tent of this Coell, and in his bed traitorouslie slue him.</p>

<p>This Fergus was therfore, in reward of his great prowesse, made there
king, whervpon they sat downe in that part, with their wiues and
children, and called it Scotland, and themselues Scots: from the
beginning of the world, foure thousand six hundred and seauentéene
yeares after the Scotish accompt, which by iust computation and
confession of all their owne writers, is six hundred yeares lacking ten,
after that Brutus had reigned ouer the whole Iland, the same land being
inioied by him and his posteritie before their comming, during two and
fiftie descents of the kings of Britaine, which is a large prescription.
Certes this intrusion into a land so manie hundred yeares before
inhabited, and by so manie descents of kings quietlie inioied, is the
best title that all their owne writers can alledge for them. But to
proceed. Fergus herevpon immediatlie did diuide Albania also among his
capteins and their souldiers: whereby it most euidentlie appeareth, that
there were no people of that nation inhabiting there before, in proofe
whereof the same partition shall follow.</p>

<p>The lands of Cathnes lieng against Orkneie, betwéene Dummesbeie and the
<span class="leftnote">Out of Hector Boecius lib. 1.</span>
water of Thane, was giuen vnto one Cornath, a capteine and his people.
The lands betwéene the water of Thane &amp; Nes, now called Rosse, being in
bredth from Cromart to the mouth of the water of Locht, were giuen to
Lutorke, another capteine and his people. The lands betweene Spaie and
Nes, from the Almane seas to the Ireland seas, now called Murraie land,
were giuen to one Warroch and his people. The land of Thalia, now called
Boin Ainze, Bogewall, Gariot, Formartine, and Bowguhan, were giuen to
one Thalis and his people. The lands of Mar Badezenoch, and Lochquhaber,
were giuen to Martach and his people. The lands of Lorne and Kintier,
with the hilles and mounteins thereof, lieng from Mar to the Ireland
seas, were giuen to capteine Nanance and his people. The lands of Athole
were giuen to Atholus, another capteine and his people. The lands of
Strabraun, &amp; Brawdawane lieng west from Dunkell, were giuen to Creones &amp;
Epidithes two capteins. The lands of Argile, were giuen to Argathelus a
capteine. The lands of Linnox &amp; Clidisdale were allotted to Lolgona a
capteine. The lands of Siluria now called Kile, Carrike &amp; Cuningham,
were giuen to Silurth another capteine. The lands of Brigance now called
Gallowaie, were giuen to the companie called Brigandes, which (as their
best men) were appointed to dwell next the Britons, who afterward
expelled the Britons from Annandale in Albania, whereby it is confessed
to be before inhabited by Britons. The residue of the land now called
Scotland, that is to saie: Meirnis, Angus, Steremond, Gowrie, Strahern,
Pirth, Fiffe, Striueling, Callender, Calderwood, Lougthian, Mers,
Teuedale, with other the Rement Dales, &amp; the Sherifdome, of Berwicke,
were then enioied by a nation mingled in marriage with the Britons, and
<span class="rightnote">Berouicum potiùs à Berubio promontorio.</span>
in their obedience, whose capteine called Beringer builded the castell
and towne of Berwicke vpon Twede, &amp; these people were called Picts, vpon
whome by the death of this Coell, these Scots had opportunitie to vse
<span class="page"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[Page 199]</span>
wars, whereof they ceased not, vntill such time as it pleased God to
appoint another Coell king of Britons, against whose name, albeit they
hoped for a like victorie to the first, yet he preuailed and ceased not
his warre, vntill these Scots were vtterlie expelled out of all the
bounds of Britaine, in which they neuer dared to reenter, vntill the
troublesome reigne of Sisilt king of Britons, which was the twelft king
after this Coell. During all which time the countrie was reinhabited by
the Britons. But then the Scots turning the ciuill discord of this
realme, betweene this Sisilt and his brother Blede to their best
aduantage, arriued againe in Albania, &amp; there made one Reuther their
king.</p>

<p>Vpon this their new arriuall, new warre was made vpon them by this
Sisilt king of Britons, in which warre Reuther their new king died, and
Thereus succéeded, against whome the warre of Britons ceased not, vntill
he freelie submitted himselfe to the said Sicill king of Britons at
Ebranke, that is Yorke, where shortlie after the tenth yeare of his
reigne he died. Finnane brother of Josine succeeded by their election to
the kingdome of Scots, who shortlie after (compelled by the warres of
the same Sicill) declared himselfe subiect, and for the better assurance
of his faith and obeisance to the king of Britons, deliuered his sonne
Durstus into the hands of this Sicill: who fantasieng the child, and
hoping by his owne succession to alter their subtiltie (I will not saie
duplicitie saith Adams) married him in the end to Agasia his owne
daughter.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Durstus.</span>
This Durstus was their next king; but for that he had married a Briton
woman, (though indeed she was a kings daughter) the Scots hated him for
the same cause, for which they ought rather to haue liked him the
better, and therefore not onelie traitorouslie slue him; but further to
declare the end of their malice, disinherited (as much as in them was)
the issues of the same Durstus and Agasia. Herevpon new warre sproong
betwéene them and vs, which ceased not vntill they were contented to
receiue Edeir to their king, the next in bloud then liuing, descended
from Durstus and Agasia, and thereby the bloud of the Britons, of the
part of the mother, was restored to the crowne of Albania: so that
nature, whose law is immutable, caused this bond of loue to hold. For
shortlie after this Edeir attended vpon Cassibelane king of Britons, for
the repulse of Iulius Cæsar, as their owne author Boetius confesseth,
who commanded the same as his subiect. But Iulius Cæsar, after his
second arriuall, by treason of Androgeus preuailed against the Britons,
and therevpon pursued this Edeir into Scotland; and (as himselfe saith
in his commentaries) subdued all the Ile of Britaine. Which though the
liuing Scots denie it, their dead writers confesse that he came beyond
Calender wood, and cast downe Camelon, the principall citie of the
Picts. And in token of this victorie, not farre from Carron, builded a
round temple of stone, which remained in some perfection vntill the
reigne of our king Edward called the first after the conquest, by whome
it was subuerted: but the monument thereof remaineth to this daie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Marius.</span>
Marius the sonne of Aruiragus, being king of all Britaine, in his time
one Roderike a Scithian, with a great rabble of néedie souldiours, came
to the water of Frith in Scotland, which is an arme of the sea, diuiding
Pentland from Fiffe: against whome this Marius assembled a power, by
which he slue this Rodericke, and discomfited his people in Westmerland:
but to those that remained aliue, he gaue the countrie of Cathnesse in
Scotland, which prooueth it to be within his owne dominion.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Coelus.</span>
Coell the sonne of this Marius had issue Lucius, counted the first
Christian king of this nation: he conuerted the three archflamines of
this land into bishopriks, and ordeined bishops vnto ech of them. The
first remained at London, and his power extended from the furthest part
of Cornewall to Humber water. The second dwelled at Yorke, and his power
stretched from Humber to the furthest part of all Scotland. The third
aboded at Caerleon vpon the riuer of Wiske in Glamorgan in Wales, &amp; his
power extended from Seuerne through all Wales. Some write that he made
but two, and turned their names to archbishops, the one to remaine at
Canturburie, the other at Yorke: yet they confesse that he of Yorke had
iurisdiction through all Scotland: either of which is sufficient to
prooue Scotland to be then vnder his dominion.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[Page 200]</span></p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Seuerus.</span>
Seuerus, by birth a Romane, but in bloud a Briton (as some thinke) and
the lineall heire of the bodie of Androgeus sonne of Lud, &amp; nephue of
Cassibelane, was shortlie after emperour &amp; king of Britons, in whose
time the people to whom his ancestor Marius gaue the land of Cathnesse
in Scotland, conspired with the Scots, &amp; receiued them from the Iles
into Scotland. But herevpon this Seuerus came into Scotland, and méeting
with their faith and false harts togither, droue them all out of the
maine land into Iles, the vttermost bounds of all great Britaine. But
notwithstanding this glorious victorie, the Britons considering their
seruitude to the Romans, imposed by treason of Androgeus, ancestor to
this Seuerus, began to hate him, whome yet they had no time to loue, and
who in their defense and suertie had slaine of the Scots and their
confederats in one battell thirtie thousand: but such was the
consideration of the common sort in those daies, whose malice no time
could diminish, nor iust desert appease.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bassianus.</span>
Antoninus Bassianus borne of a Briton woman, and Geta borne by a Romane
woman, were the sonnes of this Seuerus, who after the death of their
father, by the contrarie voices of their people, contended for the
crowne. Few Britons held with Bassianus, fewer Romans with Geta: but the
greater number with neither of both. In the end Geta was slaine, and
Bassianus remained emperour, against whom Carautius rebelled, who gaue
vnto the Scots, Picts, and Scithians, the countrie of Cathnesse in
Scotland, which they afterward inhabited, whereby his seison thereof
appeareth.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Coill.</span>
Coill, descended of the bloud of the ancient kings of this land, was
shortlie after king of the Britons, whose onelie daughter and heire
called Helen, was married vnto Constantius a Romane, who daunted the
rebellion of all parts of great Britaine; and after the death of this
Coill was in the right of his wife king thereof, and reigned in his
state ouer them thirtéene or fourtéene yeares.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Constantine.</span>
Constantine the sonne of this Constance, and Helen, was next king of
Britons, by the right of his mother, who passing to Rome to receiue the
empire thereof, deputed one Octauius king of Wales, and duke of the
Gewisses (which some expound to be afterward called west Saxons) to haue
the gouernment of this dominion. But abusing the kings innocent
goodnesse, this Octauius defrauded this trust, and tooke vpon him the
crowne. For which traitorie albeit he was once vanquished by Leonine
Traheron, great vncle to Constantine: yet after the death of this
Traheron, he preuailed againe, and vsurped ouer all Britaine.
Constantine being now emperor sent Maximius his kinsman hither (in
processe of time) to destroie the same Octauius, who in singular battell
discomfited him. Wherevpon this Maximius, as well by the consent of
great Constantine, as by the election of all the Britons, for that he
was a Briton in bloud, was made king or rather vicegerent of Britaine.
This Maximius made warre vpon the Scots and Scithians within Britaine,
and ceassed not vntill he had slaine Eugenius their king, and expelled
and driuen them out of the whole limits and bounds of Britaine. Finallie
he inhabited all Scotland with Britons, no man, woman, nor child of the
Scotish nation suffered to remaine within it, which (as their Hector
Boetius saith) was for their rebellion; and rebellion properlie could it
not be, except they had béene subiects. He suffered the Picts also to
remaine his subiects, who made solemne othes to him, neuer after to
erect anie peculiar king of their owne nation, but to remaine vnder the
old empire of the onelie king of Britaine. I had once an epistle by
Leland exemplified (as he saith) out of a verie ancient record which
beareth title of Helena vnto hir sonne Constantine, and entreth after
this manner; "Domino semper Augusto filio Constantino, mater Helena
semper Augusta, &amp;c." And now it repenteth me that I did not exemplifie
and conueigh it into this treatise whilest I had his books. For thereby
I might haue had great light for the estate of this present discourse:
but as then I had no mind to haue trauelled in this matter;
neuerthelesse, if hereafter it come againe to light I would wish it were
reserued. It followeth on also in this maner (as it is translated out of
the Gréeke) "Veritatem sapientis animus non recusat, nec fides recta
aliquando patitur quamcunque iacturam, &amp;c."</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[Page 201]</span></p>

<p>About fiue and fourtie yeares after this (which was long time after the
death of this Maximius) with the helpe of Gouan or Gonan and Melga, the
Scots newlie arriued in Albania, and there created one Fergus the second
of that name to be there king. But bicause they were before banished the
continent land, they crowned him king on their aduenture in Argile, in
the fatall chaire of marble, the yéere of our Lord, foure hundred and
two and twentie, as they themselues doo write.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Maximian.</span>
Maximian sonne of Leonine Traheron, brother to king Coill, and vncle to
Helene, was by lineall succession next king of Britons: but to appease
the malice of Dionothus king of Wales, who also claimed the kingdome, he
married Othilia eldest daughter of Dionothus, and afterwards assembled a
great power of Britons, and entered Albania, inuading Gallowaie, Mers,
Annandale, Pentland, Carrike, Kill, and Cuningham, and in battell slue
both this Fergus then king of Scots, and Durstus the king of Picts, and
exiled all their people out of the continent land: wherevpon the few
number of Scots then remaining a liue, went to Argile, and there made
Eugenius their king. When this Maximian had thus obteined quietnesse in
Britaine, he departed with his cousine Conan Meridocke into Armorica,
where they subdued the king, and depopulated the countrie, which he gaue
to Conan his cousine, to be afterward inhabited by Britons, by the name
of Britaine the lesse: and hereof this realme tooke name of Britaine the
great, which name by consent of forren writers it keepeth vnto this
daie.</p>

<p>After the death of Maximian, dissention being mooued betweene the nobles
of Britaine, the Scots swarmed togither againe, and came to the wall of
Adrian, where (this realme being diuided in manie factions) they
ouercame one. And herevpon their Hector Boetius (as an hen that for
laieng of one eg, will make a great cakeling) solemnlie triumphing for a
conquest before the victorie, alledgeth that hereby the Britons were
made tributaries to the Scots, and yet he confesseth that they won no
more land, by that supposed conquest, but the same portion betwéene them
and Humber, which in the old partitions before was annexed to Albania.
It is hard to be beléeued, that such a broken nation as the Scots at
that time were, returning from banishment within foure yeares before,
and since in battell loosing both their kings, and the great number of
their best men, to be thus able to make a conquest of great Britaine;
and verie vnlikelie if they had conquered it, they would haue left the
hot sunne of the south parts, to dwell in the cold snow in Scotland.
Incredible it is, that if they had conquered it, they would not haue
deputed officers in it, as in cases of conquest behooueth. And it is
beyond all beliefe, that great Britaine, or any other countrie, should
be woon without the comming of anie enimie into it: as they did not, but
taried finallie at the same wall of Adrian, whereof I spake before.</p>

<p>But what need I speake of these defenses, when the same Boecius scantlie
trusteth his owne beliefe in this tale. For he saieth that Galfride, and
sundrie other authentike writers, diuerslie varie from this part of his
storie, wherein his owne thought accuseth his conscience of vntruth:
herein also he further forgetting how it behooueth a lier to be mindfull
of his assertion, in the fourth chapter next following, wholie bewraieth
himselfe, saieng that the confederat kings of Scots and Picts, vpon
ciuill warres betwéene the Britons (which then followed) hoped shortlie
to inioie all the land of great Britaine, from beyond Humber vnto the
fresh sea, which hope had bene vaine, and not lesse than void, if it had
béene their owne by anie conquest before.</p>

<p>Constantine of Britaine, descended from Conan king thereof, cousine of
Brutes bloud to this Maximian, and his neerest heire was next king of
Britaine; he immediatlie pursued the Scots with wars, and shortlie in
battell slue their king Dongard, in the first yeare of his reigne,
whereby he recouered Scotland out of their hands, and tooke all the
holdes thereof into his owne possessions. Vortiger shortlie after
obteined the crowne of Britaine, against whom the Scots newlie rebelled:
for the repressing whereof (mistrusting the Britons to hate him for
sundrie causes, as one that to auoid the smoke dooth oft fall into the
fire) receiued Hengest a Saxon, and a great number of his countriemen,
<span class="page"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[Page 202]</span>
with whom and a few Britons he entred Scotland &amp; ouercame them,
wherevpon they tooke the Iles, which are their common refuge. He gaue
also much of Scotland, as Gallowaie, Pentland, Mers and Annandale, with
sundrie other lands to this Hengest and his people to inhabit, which
they did accordinglie inioie. But when this Hengest in processe of time
thirsted after the whole kingdome of the south, he was banished, and yet
afterward being restored, he conspired with the Scots against
Aurilambrose the sonne of Constantine, the iust inheritor of this whole
dominion. But his vntruth and theirs were both recompensed togither, for
<span class="leftnote">Some thinke the Seimors to come from this man by lineall
descent and I suppose no lesse.</span>
he was taken prisoner by Eldulph de Samor a noble man of Britaine, and
his head for his traitorie striken off at the commandement of
Aurilambrose. In the field the Scots were vanquished: but Octa the sonne
of Hengest was receiued to mercie, to whome and his people this
Aurilambrose gaue the countrie of Gallowaie in Scotland, for which they
became his subiects. And hereby appeareth that Scotland was then againe
reduced into his hands.</p>

<p>Vter called also Pendragon, brother to Aurilambrose was next king of the
Britons, against whome, these sworne Saxons now foresworne subiects
(confederate with the Scots) newlie rebelled: but by his power assembled
against them in Gallowaie in Scotland, they were discomfited, &amp; Albania
againe recouered vnto his subiection. Arthur the sonne of this Vter,
begotten before the mariage, but lawfullie borne in matrimonie,
succéeded next to the crowne of great Britaine; whose noble acts, though
manie vulgar fables haue rather stained than commended: yet all the
Scotish writers confesse, that he subdued great Britaine, and made it
tributarie to him, and ouercame the Saxons then scattered as far as
Cathnesse in Scotland: and in all these wars against them, he had the
seruice and obeisance of Scots and Picts. But at the last setting their
féet in the guilefull paths of their predecessors, they rebelled and
besieged the citie of Yorke, Howell king of the lesse Britaine cousine
to king Arthur being therein. But he with an host came thither and
discomfited the Scots, chased them into a marsh, and besieged them there
so long, that they were almost famished: vntill the bishops, abbats, and
men of religion (for as much as they were christened people) besought
him to take them to his mercie and grace, and to grant them a portion of
the same countrie to dwell in vnder euerlasting subiection. Vpon this he
tooke them to his grace, homage and fealtie: and when they were sworne
his subiects and liegemen, he ordeined his kinsman Anguisan to be their
king and gouernour, Vrian king of Iland, and Murefrence king of
Orkeneie. He made an archbishop of Yorke also, whose authoritie extended
through all Scotland.</p>

<p>Finallie, the said Arthur holding his roiall feast at Cairleon, had
there all the kings that were subiects vnto him, among which, Angusian
the said king of Scots did his due seruice and homage, so long as he was
with him for the realme of Scotland, &amp; bare king Arthurs sword afore
him. Malgo shortlie after succéeded in the whole kingdome of great
Britaine, who vpon new resistance made, subdued Ireland, Iland, the
Orchads, Norwaie and Denmarke, and made Ethelfred a Saxon king of
Bernicia, that is, Northumberland, Louthian, and much other land of
Scotland, which Ethelfred by the sword obteined at the hands of the
wilfull inhabitants, and continued true subiect to this Malgo.</p>

<p>Cadwan succéeded in the kingdome of great Britaine, who in defense of
his subiects the Scots, made warre vpon this Ethelfred, but at the last
they agréed, and Cadwan vpon their rebellion gaue all Scotland vnto this
Ethelfred, which he therevpon subdued and inioied: but afterward in the
reigne of Cadwallo that next succeeded in great Britaine, he rebelled.
Whervpon the same Cadwallo came into Scotland, and vpon his treason
reseised the countrie into his owne hands, and hauing with him all the
vicerois of the Saxons, which then inhabited here as his subiects, in
singular battell he slue the same Ethelfred with his owne hands.</p>

<p>Oswald was shortlie after by Cadwallos gift made king of Bernicia, and
he as subiect to Cadwallo, and by his commandement discomfited the Scots
and Picts, and subdued all Scotland. Oswie the brother of this Oswald,
was by the like gift of Cadwallo, made next king of Bernicia, and he by
like commandement newlie subdued the Scots and Picts, and held them in
that obeisance to this Cadwallow, during eight and twentie yeares. Thus
Cadwallo reigned in the whole monarchie of great Britaine, hauing all
<span class="page"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[Page 203]</span>
the seuen kings thereof, as well Saxons as others his subiects: for
albeit the number of Saxons from time to time greatlie increased, yet
were they alwaies either at the first expelled, or else made tributarie
to the onelie kings of Britons for the time being, as all their owne
writers doo confesse.</p>

<p>Cadwallader was next king of the whole great Britaine, he reigned twelue
yeares ouer all the kings thereof, in great peace and tranquillitie: and
then vpon the lamentable death of his subiects, which died of sundrie
diseases innumerablie, he departed into little Britaine. His sonne and
cousine Iuor and Iue, being expelled out of England also by the Saxons,
went into Wales, where among the Britons they and their posteritie
remained princes. Vpon this great alteration, and warres being through
the whole dominion betwéene the Britons and Saxons, the Scots thought
time to slip the collar of obedience, and therevpon entred in league
with Charles then king of France, establishing it in this wise.</p>

<p class="ind">1 "The iniurie of Englishmen doone to anie of these people, shall be
perpetuallie holden common to them both.</p>

<p class="ind">2 "When Frenchmen be inuaded by Englishmen, the Scots shall send their
armie in defense of France, so that they be supported with monie and
vittels by the French.</p>

<p class="ind">3 "When Scots be inuaded by Englishmen, the Frenchmen shall come vpon
their owne expenses, to their support and succour.</p>

<p class="ind">4 "None of the people shall take peace or truce with Englishmen, without

<p><span class="rightnote"><em>Nicholas Adams.</em></span>
Manie disputable opinions may be had of warre without the praising of
it, as onelie admittable by inforced necessitie, and to be vsed for
peace sake onelie, where here the Scots sought warre for the loue of
warre onelie. For their league giueth no benefit to themselues, either
in frée traffike of their owne commodities, or benefit of the French, or
other priuilege to the people of both. What discommoditie riseth by
loosing the intercourse and exchange of our commodities (being in
necessaries more aboundant than France) the Scots féele, and we
perfectlie know. What ruine of their townes, destruction of countries,
slaughter of both peoples, haue by reason of this bloudie league
chanced, the histories be lamentable to read, and horrible among
Christian men to be remembred: but God gaue the increase according to
their séed, for as they did hereby sowe dissention, so did they shortlie
after reape a bloudie slaughter and confusion. For Alpine their king,
possessing a light mind that would be lost with a little wind, hoped by
this league shortlie to subdue all great Britaine, and to that end not
onelie rebelled in his owne kingdome, but also vsurped vpon the kingdome
of Picts. Whervpon Edwine king of England, made one Brudeus king of
Picts, whom he sent into Scotland with a great power, where in battell
he tooke this Alpine king of Scots prisoner, and discomfited his people.
And this Alpine being their king found subiect and rebell, his head was
striken off at a place in Scotland, which thereof is to this daie called
Pasalpine, that is to saie, the head of Alpine. And this was the first
effect of their French league.</p>

<p>Osbright king of England, with Ella his subiect, and a great number of
Britons and Saxons shortlie after, for that the Scots had of themselues
elected a new king, entered Scotland, and ceassed not his war against
them, vntill their king and people fled into the Iles, with whome at the
last vpon their submission, peace was made in this wise.</p>

<p>The water of Frith shall be march betwéene Scots and Englishmen in the
east parts, and shall be named the Scotish sea.</p>

<p>The water of Cluide to Dunbriton, shall be march in the west parts
betwéene the Scots and Britons. This castell was before called Alcluide,
but now Dunbriton, that is to say, the castle of Britons, and sometimes
it was destroied by the Danes. So the Britons had all the lands from
Sterling to the Ireland seas, and from the water of Frith &amp; Cluide to
Cumber, with all the strengths and commodities thereof: and the
Englishmen had the lands betwéene Sterling and Northumberland. Thus was
Cluide march betwéene the Scots and the Britons on the one side, and the
water of Frith named the Scotish sea, march betwéene them and Englishmen
on the other side, and Sterling common march to thrée people, Britons,
Englishmen, and Scots, howbeit king Osbright had the castle of Stirling,
<span class="page"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[Page 204]</span>
where first he caused to be coined Sterling monie. The Englishmen also
builded a bridge of stone, for passage ouer the water of Frith, in the
middest whereof they made a crosse, vnder which were written these
verses:</p>

<p class="ind1">I am free march, as passengers may ken,<br />
To Scots, to Britons, and Englishmen.</p>

<p>Not manie yeares after this, Hinguar and Hubba, two Danes, with a great
number of people, arriued in Scotland, and slue Constantine, whom
Osbright had before made king: wherevpon Edulfe or Ethelwulfe, then king
of England, assembled his power against Hinguar and Hubba, and in one
battell slue them both; but such of their people as would remaine and
become christians, he suffered to tarie: the rest he banished or put to
death, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This Ethelwulfe granted the Peter pence, of which albeit Peter &amp; Paule
had little need and lesse right: yet the paiment thereof continued in
this realme euer after vntill now of late yeares. But the Scots euer
since vnto this daie haue, and yet doo paie it, by reason of that grant,
which prooueth them to be then vnder his obeisance.</p>

<p>Alured or Alfred succéeded in the kingdome of England, and reigned
noblie ouer the whole monarchie of great Britaine: he made lawes, that
persons excommunicated should be disabled to sue or claime anie
propertie; which law Gregour, whome this Alured had made king of Scots,
obeied; and the same law as well in Scotland as in England is holden to
this daie, which also prooueth him to be high lord of Scotland.</p>

<p>This Alured constreined Gregour king of Scots also to breake the league
with France, for generallie he concluded with him, and serued him in all
his warres, as well against Danes as others, not reseruing or making
anie exception of the former league with France.</p>

<p>The said Alured, after the death of Gregour, had the like seruice and
obeisance of Donald king of Scots with fiue thousand horssemen, against
one Gurmond a Dane that then infested the realme, and this Donald died
in this faith and obeisance with Alured.</p>

<p>Edward the first of that name called Chifod sonne of this Alured
succéeded his father, and was the next king of England: against whome
Sithrijc a Dane and the Scots conspired; but they were subdued, and
Constantine their king brought to obeisance. He held the realme of
Scotland also of king Edward, and this dooth Marian their owne
countrieman a Scot confesse: beside Roger Houeden, and William of
Malmesberie.</p>

<p>In the yeare of our Lord 923, the same king Edward was president and
gouernour of all the people of England, Cumberland, Scots, Danes, and
Britons.</p>

<p>King Athelstane in like sort conquered Scotland, and as he laie in his
tents beside Yorke, whilest the warres lasted, the king of Scots feined
himselfe to be a minstrell, and harped before him onelie to espie his
ordinance and his people. But being (as their writers confesse)
corrupted with monie, he sold his faith and false heart together to the
Danes, and aided them against king Athelstane at sundrie times. Howbeit
he met with all their vntruthes at Broningfield in the west countrie, as
is mentioned in the ninth chapter of the first booke of this
description, where he discomfited the Danes, and slue Malcolme deputie
in that behalfe to the king of Scots: in which battell the Scots
confesse themselues to haue lost more people than were remembred in anie
age before. Then Athelstane following his good lucke, went throughout
all Scotland and wholie subdued it, and being in possession thereof,
gaue land there lieng in Annandale by his deed, the copie wherof dooth
follow:</p>

<p>"I king Athelstane, giues vnto Paulam, Oddam and Roddam, als good and
als faire, as euer they mine were, and thereto witnesse Mauld my wife."</p>

<p>By which course words, not onelie appeareth the plaine simplicitie of
mens dooings in those daies: but also a full proofe that he was then
seized of Scotland. At the last also he receiued homage of Malcolme king
of Scots: but for that he could not be restored to his whole kingdome,
he entered into religion, and there shortlie after died.</p>

<p>Then Athelstane, for his better assurance of that countrie there after,
thought it best to haue two stringes to the bowe of their obedience, and
therefore not onelie constituted one Malcolme to be their king, but also
<span class="page"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[Page 205]</span>
appointed one Indulph sonne of Constantine the third, to be called
prince of Scotland, to whome he gaue much of Scotland: and for this
Malcolme did homage to Athelstane.</p>

<p>Edmund brother of Athelstane succéeded next king of England, to whome
this Indulph then king of Scots not onelie did homage, but also serued
him with ten thousand Scots, for the expulsion of the Danes out of the
realme of England.</p>
<p>
Edred or Eldred brother to this Edmund succéeded next king of England:
<span class="leftnote">Some referre this to an Edward.</span>
he not onelie receiued the homage of Irise then king of Scots, but also
the homage of all the barons of Scotland.</p>

<p>Edgar the sonne of Edmund, brother of Athelstane, being now of full age,
was next king of England: he reigned onelie ouer the whole monarchie of
Britaine, and receiued homage of Keneth king of Scots for the kingdome
of Scotland, and made Malcolme prince thereof.</p>

<p>This Edgar gaue vnto the same Keneth the countrie of Louthian in
Scotland, which was before seized into the hands of Osbright king of
England for their rebellion, as is before declared. He inioined Keneth
their said king also once in euerie yéere at certeine principall feasts
(whereat the king did vse to weare his crowne) to repaire vnto him into
England for the making of lawes: which in those daies was doone by the
noble men or péeres according to the order of France at this daie. He
allowed also sundrie lodgings in England, to him and his successours,
whereat to lie, and refresh themselues in their iourneies, whensoeuer
they should come vp to doo their homages: and finallie a péece of ground
lieng beside the new palace of Westminster, vpon which this Keneth
builded a house, that by him and his posteritie was inioied vntill the
reigne of king Henrie the second. In whose time, vpon the rebellion of
William king of Scots, it was resumed into the king of Englands hand.
The house is decaied, but the ground where it stood is called Scotland
to this daie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Lawfull age and wardship of heires.</span>
Moreouer, Edgar made this law, that no man should succéed to his
patrimonie or inheritance holden by knights seruice, vntill he
accomplished the age of one and twentie yéeres: because by intendment
vnder that age, he should not be able in person to serue his king and
countrie according to the tenor of his deed, and the condition of his
purchase. This law was receiued by the same Keneth in Scotland; and as
well there as in England is obserued to this daie: which prooueth also
that Scotland was then vnder his obeisance.</p>
<p>
In the yeere of our Lord 974, Kinald king of Scots, and Malcolme king of
Cumberland, Macon king of Man and the Iles, Duuenall king of Southwales,
Siferth and Howell kings of the rest of Wales, Jacob or James of
Gallowaie, &amp; Jukill of Westmerland did homage to king Edgar at Chester.
And on the morrow going by water to the monasterie of saint Iohns to
seruice, and returning home againe: the said Edgar sitting in a barge,
and stirring the same vpon the water of Dée, made the said kings to row
the barge, saieng that his successors might well be ioifull to haue the
prerogatiue of so great honour, and the superioritie of so manie mightie
princes to be subiect vnto their monarchie.</p>
<p>
Edward, the sonne of this Edgar, was next king of England, in whose time
this Keneth king of Scots caused Malcolme king of Scotland to be
poisoned. Wherevpon king Edward made warre against him, which ceased not
vntill this Keneth submitted himselfe, and offered to receiue him for
prince of Scotland, whome king Edward would appoint. Herevpon king
Edward proclamed one Malcolme to be prince of Scotland, who immediatlie
came into England, and there did homage vnto the same king Edward.</p>

<p>Etheldred, brother of this Edward succeeded next ouer England, against
whome Swaine king of Denmarke conspired with this last Malcolme then
king of Scots. But shortlie after, this Malcolme sorrowfullie submitted
himselfe into the defense of Etheldred: who considering how that which
could not be amended, must onelie be repented, benignlie receiued him.
By helpe of whose seruice at last Etheldred recouered his realme againe
out of the hands of Swaine, and reigned ouer the whole monarchie eight
and thirtie yéeres.</p>

<p>Edmund surnamed Ironside, sonne of this Etheldred, was next king of
<span class="page"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[Page 206]</span>
England, in whose time Canutus a Dane inuaded the realme with much
crueltie. But at the last he married with Emme sometime wife vnto
Etheldred and mother of this Edmund. Which Emme, as arbitratrix betweene
hir naturall loue to the one, and matrimoniall dutie to the other,
procured such amitie betwéene them in the end, that Edmund was contented
to diuide the realme with Canutus: and keeping to himselfe all England
on this side Humber, gaue all the rest beyond Humber, with the
seigniorie of Scotland to this Canutus. Wherevpon Malcolme then king of
Scots (after a little accustomable resistance) did homage to the same
Canutus for the kingdome of Scotland. Thus the said Canutus held the
same ouer of this Edmund king of England by the like seruices, so long
as they liued togither. This Canutus in memorie of this victorie, and
glorie of his seigniorie ouer the Scots, commanded Malcolme their king
to build a church in Buchquhan in Scotland, (where a field betweene him
and them was fought) to be dedicated to Olauus patrone of Norwaie and
Denmarke, which church was by the same Malcolme accordinglie performed.</p>

<p>Edward called the Confessour, sonne of Etheldred, and brother to Edmund
Ironside, was afterward king of England: he tooke from Malcolme king of
Scots his life and his kingdome, and made Malcolme sonne to the king of
Cumberland and Northumberland king of Scots, who did him homage and
fealtie.</p>

<p>This Edward perused the old lawes of the realme, and somewhat added to
some of them: as to the law of Edgar for the wardship of the lands
vntill the heire should accomplish the age of one and twentie yeeres. He
added, that the marriage of such heire should also belong to the lord of
<span class="leftnote">To whome the marriage of the ward perteineth.</span>
whom the same land was holden. Also, that euerie woman marrieng a
freeman, should (notwithstanding she had no children by that husband)
enioie the third part of his inheritance during hir life: with manie
other lawes which the same Malcolme king of Scots obeied, and which as
well by them in Scotland, as by vs in England be obserued to this day,
and directlie prooueth the whole to be then vnder his obeisance.</p>

<p>By reason of this law, Malcolme the sonne of Duncane next inheritor to
the crowne of Scotland, being within age, was by the nobles of Scotland
deliuered as ward to the custodie also of king Edward. During whose
minoritie, one Makebeth a Scot traitorouslie vsurped the crowne of
Scotland. Against whome the said Edward made warre, in which the said
Mackbeth was ouercome and slaine. Wherevpon the said Malcolme was
crowned king of Scots at Scone, in the eight yeere of the reigne of king
Edward aforesaid. This Malcolme also by tenor of the said new law of
wardship, was married vnto Margaret the daughter of Edward sonne of
Edmund Ironside and Agatha, by the disposition of the same king Edward,
and at his full age did homage to this king Edward the Confessour for
the kingdome of Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Edward the Confessour.</span>
Moreouer, Edward of England, hauing no issue of his bodie, and
mistrusting that Harald the son of Goodwine, descended of the daughter
of Harald Harefoot the Dane, would vsurpe the crowne, if he should leaue
it to his cousine Edgar Eatling (being then within age) and partlie by
the petition of his subiects, who before had sworne neuer to receiue
anie kings ouer them of the Danish nation, did by his substantiall will
in writing (as all our clergie writers affirme) demise the crowne of
great Britaine vnto William Bastard, then duke of Normandie, and to his
heires, constituting him his heire testamentarie. Also there was
proximitie in bloud betwéene them: for Emme daughter of Richard duke of
Normandie was wife vnto Etheldred, on whom he begat Alured and this
Edward: and this William was son of Robert sonne of Richard, brother of
the whole bloud to the same Emme. Whereby appeareth that this William
was heire by title, and not by conquest, albeit that partlie to
extinguish the mistrust of other titles, and partlie for the glorie of
his victorie, he chalenged in the end, the name of a conquerour, and
hath béene so written euer since the time of his arriuall.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">William Bastard.</span>
Furthermore, this William, called the Bastard and the Conquerour,
supposed not his conquest perfect till he had likewise subdued the
Scots. Wherfore to bring the Scots to iust obeisance after his
coronation, as heire testamentarie to Edward the Confessour; he entred
Scotland, where after a little resistance made by the inhabitants, the
<span class="page"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[Page 207]</span>
said Malcolme then their king did homage to him at Abirnethie in
Scotland for the kingdome of Scotland, as to his superiour also by meane
of his late conquest.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">William Rufus.</span>
William surnamed Rufus, sonne to this William called the Conquerour,
succéeded next in the throne of England, to whome the said Malcolme king
of Scots did like homage for the whole kingdome of Scotland. But
afterward he rebelled, and was by this William Rufus slaine in plaine
field. Wherevpon the Scotishmen did choose one Donald or Dunwall to be
their king. But this William Rufus deposed him, and created Dunkane
sonne of Malcolme to be their king, who did like homage to him.
Finallie, this Dunkane was slaine by the Scots, and Dunwall restored,
who once againe by this William Rufus was deposed; and Edgar son of
Malcolme, and brother to the last Malcolme, was by him made their king,
who did like homage for Scotland to this William Rufus.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Henrie I.</span>
Henrie called Beauclerke the sonne of William called the Conquerour,
after the death of his brother William Rufus, succéeded to the crowne of
England, to whome the same Edgar king of Scots did homage for Scotland:
this Henrie Beauclerke maried Mawd the daughter of Malcolme K. of Scots,
and by hir had issue Mawd afterward empresse.</p>

<p>Alexander the sonne of Malcolme brother to this Mawd was next king of
Scots, he did like homage for the kingdome of Scotland to this Henrie
the first, as Edgar had doone before him.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Mawd.</span>
Mawd called the empresse, daughter and heire to Henrie Beauclerke and
Mawd his wife, receiued homage of Dauid, brother to hir and to this
Alexander next king of Scots, before all the temporall men of England
for the kingdome of Scotland. This Mawd the empresse gaue vnto Dauid in
the marriage, Mawd the daughter and heire of Voldosius earle of
Huntingdon &amp; Northumberland. And herein their euasion appeareth, by
which they allege that their kings homages were made for the earledome
of Huntingdon. For this Dauid was the first that of their kings was
earle of Huntingdon, which was since all the homages of their kings
before recited, and at the time of this mariage, &amp; long after the said
Alexander his brother was king of Scots, doing the homage aforesaid to
Henrie Beauclerke son to the aforesaid ladie, of whome I find this
epitaph worthie to be remembred:</p>

<p class="ind1">Ortu magna, viro maior, sed maxima partu,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hîc iacet Henrici filia, sponsa, parens.</p>

<p>In the yéere of our Lord 1136, and first yéere of the reigne of king
Stephan, the said Dauid king of Scots being required to doo his homage,
refused it: for so much as he had doone homage to Mawd the empresse
before time; notwithstanding the sonne of the said Dauid did homage to
king Stephan.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Henrie 2.</span>
Henrie called Fitz empresse, the sonne of Mawd the empresse daughter of
Mawd, daughter of Malcolme king of Scots, was next king of England. He
receiued homage for Scotland of Malcolme sonne of Henrie, sonne of the
said Dauid their last king. Which Malcolme after this homage attended
vpon the same king Henrie in his warres against Lewis then king of
France. Whereby appeareth that their French league was neuer renewed
after the last diuision of their countrie by Osbright king of England.
But after these warres finished with the French king, this Malcolme
being againe in Scotland rebelled: wherevpon king Henrie immediatlie
seized Huntingdon and Northumberland into his owne hands by confiscation,
and made warres vpon him in Scotland: during which the same Malcolme
died without issue of his bodie.</p>

<p>William brother of this Malcolme was next king of Scots, he with all the
<span class="leftnote">Because they were taken from him before.</span>
nobles of Scotland (which could not be now for anie earledome) did
homage to the sonne of Henrie the second, his father. Also the earledome
of Huntingdon was (as ye haue heard) before this forfeited by Malcolme
his brother, and neuer after restored to the crowne of Scotland.</p>

<p>This William did afterward attend vpon the same Henrie the second, in
his warres in Normandie against the French king (notwithstanding their
French league) and then being licenced to depart home in the tenth of
this prince, and vpon the fifteenth of Februarie he returned, and vpon
the sixtéenth of October did homage to him for the realme of Scotland.
<span class="page"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[Page 208]</span>
In token also of his perpetuall subjection to the crowne of England, he
offered vp his cloake, his saddle, and his speare at the high altar in
Yorke: wherevpon he was permitted to depart home into Scotland, where
immediatlie he mooued cruell warre in Northumberland against the same
king Henrie, being as yet in Normandie. But God tooke the defense of
king Henries part, and deliuered the same William king of Scots into the
hands of a few Englishmen, who brought him prisoner to king Henrie into
Normandie in the twentith yeere of his reigne. But at the last, at the
sute of Dauid his brother, Richard bishop of saint Andrews, and other
bishops and lords, he was put to this fine for the amendment of his
trespasse; to wit, to paie ten thousand pounds sterling, and to
surrender all his title to the earldome of Huntingdon, Cumberland, &amp;
Northumberland into the hands of king Henrie, which he did in all things
accordinglie, sealing his charters thereof with the great scale of
Scotland, and signets of his nobilitie yet to be seene: wherein it was
also comprised, that he and his successours should hold the realme of
Scotland of the king of England and his successours for euer. And
herevpon he once againe did homage to the same king Henrie, which now
could not be for the earledome of Huntingdon, the right whereof was
alreadie by him surrendered. And for the better assurance of this faith
also, the strengths of Berwike, Edenborough, Roxborough, and Striueling
were deliuered into the hands of our king Henrie of England, which their
owne writers confesse. But Hector Boetius saith, that this trespasse was
amended by fine of twentie thousand pounds sterling, and that the
erledome of Huntingdon, Cumberland, and Northumberland were deliuered as
morgage into the hands of king Henrie, vntill other ten thousand pounds
sterling should be to him paid, which is so farre from truth, as Hector
was (while he liued) from well meaning to our countrie. But if we grant
that it is true, yet prooueth he not that the monie was paid, nor the
land otherwise redéemed, or euer after came to anie Scotish kings hands.
And thus it appeareth that the earledome of Huntingdon was neuer
occasion of the homages of the Scotish kings to the kings of England,
either before this time or after.</p>

<p>This was doone 1175. Moreouer I read this note hereof gathered out of
Robertus Montanus or Montensis that liued in those daies, and was (as I
take it) "confessor to king Henrie. The king of Scots dooth homage to
king Henrie for the kingdome of Scotland, and is sent home againe, his
bishops also did promise to doo the like to the archbishop of Yorke, and
to acknowledge themselues to be of his prouince and iurisdiction. By
vertue also of this composition the said Robert saith, that Rex Angliæ
dabat honores, episcopatus, abbatias, &amp; alias dignitates in Scotia, vel
saltem eius consilio dabantur, that is, The king of England gaue honors,
bishopriks, abbatships, and other dignities in Scotland, or at the
leastwise they were not giuen without his aduise and counsell."</p>

<p>At this time Alexander bishop of Rome (supposed to haue generall
iurisdiction ecclesiasticall through christendome) established the whole
cleargie of Scotland (according to the old lawes) vnder the iurisdiction
of the archbishop of Yorke.</p>

<p>In the yeare of our Lord 1185, in the moneth of August, at Cairleill,
Rouland Talmant lord of Galwaie, did homage and fealtie to the said king
Henrie with all that held of him.</p>

<p>In the two and twentith yeare of the reigne of king Henrie the second,
Gilbert sonne of Ferguse prince of Galwaie, did homage and fealtie to
the said king Henrie, and left Dunecan his sonne in hostage for
conseruation of his peace.</p>

<p>Richard surnamed C&oelig;ur de Lion, because of his stoutnesse, and sonne
of this Henrie was next king of England, to whome the same William king
of Scots did homage at Canturburie for the whole kingdome of Scotland.</p>

<p>This king Richard was taken prisoner by the duke of Ostrich, for whose
redemption the whole realme was taxed at great summes of monie vnto the
which this William king of Scots (as a subject) was contributorie, and
paied two thousand markes sterling.</p>

<p>In the yeare of our Lord 1199, Iohn king of England sent to William king
of Scots, to come and doo his homage, which William came to Lincolne in
the moneth of December the same yeare, and did his homage vpon an hill
in the presence of Hubert archbishop of Canturburie, and of all the
<span class="page"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[Page 209]</span>
people there assembled, and therevnto tooke his oth and was sworne vpon
the crosse of the said Hubert: also he granted by his charter confirmed,
that he should haue the mariage of Alexander his sonne, as his liegeman,
alwaies to hold of the king of England: promising moreouer that he the
said king William and his sonne Alexander, should keepe and hold faith
and allegiance to Henrie sonne of the said king Iohn, as to their chiefe
lord against all maner of men that might liue and die.</p>

<p>Also whereas William king of Scots had put Iohn bishop of saint Andrew
out of his bishoprike, pope Clement wrote to Henrie king of England,
that he should mooue and induce the same William; and if néed required
by his roiall power and prerogatiue ouer that nation, to compell him to
leaue his rancor against the said bishop, and suffer him to haue and
occupie his said bishoprike againe.</p>

<p>In the yeare of our Lord 1216, and fiue &amp; twentith of the reigne of
Henrie, sonne to king Iohn, the same Henrie and the quéene were at Yorke
at the feast of Christmasse, for the solemnization of a marriage made in
the feast of saint Stephan the martyr the same yeare, betwéene Alexander
king of Scots, and Margaret the kings daughter, and there the said
Alexander did homage to Henrie king of England for all the realme of
Scotland.</p>

<p>In buls of diuerse popes were admonitions giuen to the kings of Scots,
as appeareth by that of Gregorie the fift and Clement his successor,
that they should obserue and trulie kéepe all such appointments, as had
béene made betwéene the kings of England and Scotland. And that the
kings of Scotland should still hold the realme of Scotland of the kings
of England, vpon paine of cursse and interdiction.</p>

<p>After the death of Alexander king of Scots, Alexander his sonne, being
nine yeares of age, was by the lawes of Edgar, in ward to king Henrie
the third, &amp; by the nobles of Scotland brought to Yorke, and there
deliuered vnto him. During whose minoritie king Henrie gouerned
Scotland, and to subdue a commotion in this realme, vsed the aid of fiue
thousand Scotishmen. But king Henrie died during the nonage of this
Alexander, whereby he receiued not his homage, which by reason and law
was respited vntill his full age of one and twentie yeares.</p>

<p>Edward the first after the conquest, sonne of this Henrie was next king
of England; immediatlie after whose coronation, Alexander king of Scots,
being then of full age, did homage to him for Scotland at Westminster,
swearing (as all the rest did) after this maner.</p>

<p>"I. D. N. king of Scots shall be true and faithfull vnto you lord E. by
the grace of God king of England, the noble and superior lord of the
kingdome of Scotland, and vnto you I make my fidelitie for the same
kingdome, the which I hold and claime to hold of you. And I shall beare
you my faith and fidelitie of life and lim, and worldlie honour against
all men, faithfullie I shall knowlege and shall doo you seruice due vnto
you of the kingdome of Scotland aforesaid, as God me so helpe and these
holie euangelies."</p>

<p>This Alexander king of Scots died, leauing one onelie daughter called
Margaret for his heire, who before had maried Hanigo, sonne to Magnus
king of Norwaie, which daughter also shortlie after died, leauing one
onelie daughter hir heire, of the age of two yeares, whose custodie and
mariage by the lawes of king Edgar, and Edward the confessor, belonged
to Edward the first: whervpon the nobles of Scotland were commanded by
our king Edward to send into Norwaie, to conueie this yoong queene into
England to him, whome he intended to haue maried to his sonne Edward:
and so to haue made a perfect vnion long wished for betwéene both
realmes. Herevpon their nobles at that time considering the same
tranquillitie that manie of them haue since refused, stood not vpon
shifts and delaies of minoritie nor contempt, but most gladlie
consented, and therevpon sent two noble men of Scotland into Norwaie,
for hir to be brought to this king Edward, but she died before their
comming thither, and therefore they required nothing but to inioie the
lawfull liberties that they had quietlie possessed in the last king
Alexanders time.</p>

<p>After the death of this Margaret, the Scots were destitute of anie heire
to the crowne from this Alexander their last king, at which time this
Edward descended from the bodie of Mawd daughter of Malcolme sometime
<span class="page"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[Page 210]</span>
king of Scots, being then in the greatest broile of his warres with
France, minded not to take the possession of that kingdome in his owne
right, but was contented to establish Balioll to be king thereof, the
weake title betwéene him, Bruse, &amp; Hastings, being by the humble
petition of all the realme of Scotland c&#333;mitted to the determination
of king Edward, wherein by autentike writing they confessed the
superioritie of the realme to remaine in king Edward, sealed with the
seales of foure bishops, seuen earles, and twelue barons of Scotland,
and which shortlie after was by the whole assent of the three estates of
Scotland, in their solemne parlement confessed and enacted accordinglie,
as most euidentlie dooth appeare.</p>

<p>The Balioll in this wise made king of Scotland, did immediatlie make his
homage and fealtie at Newcastell vpon saint Stéeuens daie (as did
likewise all the lords of Scotland, each one setting his hand to the
composition in writing) to king Edward of England for the kingdome of
Scotland: but shortlie after defrauding the benigne goodnesse of his
superiour, he rebelled, and did verie much hurt in England. Herevpon
king Edward inuaded Scotland, seized into his hands the greater part of
the countrie, and tooke all the strengths thereof. Whervpon Balioll king
of Scots came vnto him to Mauntrosse in Scotland with a white wand in
his hand, and there resigned the crowne of Scotland, with all his right,
title, and interest to the same, into the hands of king Edward, and
thereof made his charter in writing, dated and sealed the fourth yeare
of his reigne. All the nobles and gentlemen of Scotland also repaired to
Berwike, and did homage and fealtie to king Edward, there becomming his
subiects. For the better assurance of whose oths also, king Edward kept
all the strengths and holdes of Scotland in his owne hands; and herevpon
all their lawes, processes, all iudgements, gifts of assises and others,
passed vnder the name and authoritie of king Edward. Leland touching the
same rehearsall, writeth thereof in this maner.</p>

<p>"In the yeare of our Lord 1295, the same Iohn king of Scots, contrarie
to his faith and allegiance rebelled against king Edward, and came into
England, and burnt and slue without all modestie and mercie. Wherevpon
king Edward with a great host went to Newcastell vpon Tine, passed the
water of Twéed, besieged Berwike, and got it. Also he wan the castell of
Dunbar, and there were slaine at this brunt 15700 Scots. Then he
proceeded further, and gat the castell of Rokesborow, and the castell of
Edenborow, Striuelin and Gedworth, and his people harried all the land.
In the meane season, the said king Iohn of Scots, considering that he
was not of power to withstand king Edward, sent his letters and besought
him of treatie and peace, which our prince benignlie granted, and sent
to him againe that he should come to the towre of Brechin, and bring
thither the great lords of Scotland with him. The king of England sent
thither Antonie Becke bishop of Durham, with his roiall power, to
conclude the said treatise. And there it was agreed that the said Iohn
and all the Scots should vtterlie submit themselues to the kings will.
And to the end the submission should be performed accordinglie, the king
of Scots laid his sonne in hostage and pledge vnto him. There also he
made his letters sealed with the common seale of Scotland, by the which
he knowledging his simplenes and great offense doone to his lord king
Edward of England, by his full power and frée will yeelded vp all the
land of Scotland, with all the people and homage of the same. Then our
king went foorth to sée the mounteins, and vnderstanding that all was in
quiet and peace, he turned to the abbeie of Scone, which was
<span class="leftnote">The Scots dreame that this was the stone whereon Jacob slept when he
fled into Mesopotamia.</span>
of chanons regular, where he tooke the stone
called the Regall of Scotland, vpon which the kings of that nation were
woont to sit, at the time of their coronations for a throne, &amp; sent it
to the abbeie of Westminster, commanding to make a chaire therof for the
priests that should sing masse at the high altar: which chaire was made,
and standeth yet there at this daie to be séene."</p>

<p>In the yeare of our Lord 1296, the king held his parlement at Berwike:
and there he tooke homage singularlie of diuerse of the lords &amp; nobles
of Scotland. And for a perpetuall memorie of the same, they made their
letters patents sealed with their seales, and then the king of England
made William Warreine earle of Surrie and Southsax lord Warden of
<span class="page"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[Page 211]</span>
Scotland, Hugh of Cressingham treasurer, and William Ormesbie iustice of
Scotland, and foorthwith sent king Iohn to the Tower of London, and Iohn
Comin, and the earle Badenauth, the earle of Bohan and other lords into
England to diuerse places on this side of the Trent.</p>

<p>And after that, in the yeare of our Lord 1297, at the feast of
Christmas, the king called before him the said Iohn king of Scots,
although he had committed him to ward: and said that he would burne or
destroie their castels, townes, and lands, if he were not recompensed
for his costs and damages susteined in the warres; but king Iohn and the
other that were in ward, answered that they had nothing, sith their
liues, their deaths, and goods were in his hands. The king vpon that
answer mooued with pitie, granted them their liues; so that they would
doo their homage, and make their oth solenmelie at the high altar (in
the church of the abbeie of Westminster) vpon the eucharist, that they
and euerie of them should hold and keepe true faith, obedience, and
allegiance to the said king Edward and his heires kings of England for
euer. And where the said king of Scots saw the kings banner of England
displaied, he and all his power should draw therevnto. And that neither
he or anie of his from thencefoorth should beare armes against the king
of England or anie of his bloud. Finallie, the king rewarding with great
gifts the said king Iohn and his lords, suffered them to depart. But
they went into Scotland alwaie imagining (notwithstanding this their
submission) how they might oppresse king Edward, and disturbe his
realme. The Scots sent also to the king of France for succour and helpe,
who sent them ships to Berwike furnished with men of armes, the king of
England then being in Flanders.</p>

<p>In the yeare of our Lord 1298, the king went into Scotland with a great
host, and the Scots also assembled in great number, but the king fought
with them at Fawkirke on S. Marie Magdalens daie, where were slaine
thréescore thousand Scots, &amp; William Walleis that was their capteine
fled, who being taken afterward, was hanged, drawen, &amp; quartered at
London, for his trespasses.</p>

<p>After this the Scots rebelled againe, and all the lords of Scotland
<span class="leftnote">This was doone upon the nine &amp; twentith of Ianuarie, 1306.</span>
chose Robert Bruse to be king, except onelie Iohn Commin earle of
Carrike, who would not consent thereto bicause of his oth made to the
king of England. Wherefore Robert Bruse slue him at Dumfrise, and then
was crowned at Schone abbeie. Herevpon the king of England assembled a
great hoast, and rode through all Scotland, discomfited Robert Bruse,
slue eight thousand Scots, &amp; tooke the most part of all the lords of
Scotland, putting the temporall lords to deth bicause they were
forsworne.</p>

<p>Edward borne at Carnaruan sonne of this Edward, was next king of
England, who from the beginning of his reigne enioied Scotland
peaceablie, dooing in all things as is aboue said of king Edward his
father, vntill toward the later end of his reigne, about which time this
Robert Bruse conspired against him, and with the helpe of a few
forsworne Scots, forswore himselfe king of Scots. Herevpon this Edward
with Thomas earle of Lancaster and manie other lords made warre vpon
him, about the feast of Marie Magdalene, the said Bruse and his
partakers being alreadie accurssed by the pope for breaking the truce
that he had established betwixt them. But being infortunate in his first
warres against him, he suffered Edward the sonne of Balioll to proclame
himselfe king of Scots; and neuerthelesse held foorth his warres against
Bruse, before the ending of which he died, as I read.</p>

<p>Edward borne at Windsore sonne of Edward the second was next king of
England, at the age of fifteene yeares, in whose minoritie the Scots
practised with Isabell mother to this Edward, and with Roger Mortimer
earle of the March to haue their homages released: whose good will
therein they obteined, so that for the same release they should paie to
this king Edward thirtie thousand pounds starling, in three yeares next
following, that is to saie, ten thousand pounds starling yeerelie. But
bicause the nobilitie and commons of this realme would not by parlement
consent vnto it, their king being within age, the same release procéeded
not, albeit the Scots ceased not their practises with this quéene and
earle. But before those thrée yeares, in which their monie (if the
bargaine had taken place) should haue béene paied, were expired, our
king Edward inuaded Scotland, and ceassed not the warre, vntill Dauid
<span class="page"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[Page 212]</span>
the sonne of Robert le Bruse (then by their election king of Scotland)
absolutelie submitted himselfe vnto him. But for that the said Dauid
Bruse had before by practise of the quéene and the earle of March,
married Iane the sister of this king Edward: he mooued by naturall zeale
to his sister, was contented to giue the realme of Scotland to this
Dauid Bruse, and to the heires that should be begotten of the bodie of
the said Iane (sauing the reuersion and meane homages to this king
Edward and to his owne children) wherewith the same Dauid Bruse was
right well contented, and therevpon immediatlie made his homage for all
the realme of Scotland to him.</p>

<p>Howbeit, shortlie after causelesse conceiuing cause of displeasure, this
Dauid procured to dissolue this same estate tailée, and therevpon not
onelie rebelled in Scotland, but also inuaded England, whilest king
Edward was occupied about his wars in France. But this Dauid was not
onelie expelled England in the end, but also thinking no place a
sufficient defense to his vntruth, of his owne accord fled out of
Scotland: whereby the countries of Annandale, Gallowaie, Mars, Teuidale,
Twedale, and Ethrike were seized into the king of Englands hands, and
new marches set betwéene England and Scotland at Cockburnes path &amp;
Sowtrie hedge. Which when this Dauid went about to recouer againe, his
power was discomfited, and himselfe by a few Englishmen taken &amp; brought
into England, where he remained prisoner eleuen yeares after his said
apprehension.</p>

<p>During this time, king Edward enioied Scotland peaceablie, and then at
the contemplation and wearie suit of his sorowfull sister, wife of this
Dauid, he was contented once againe to restore him to the kingdome of
Scotland. Wherevpon it was concluded, that for this rebellion Dauid
should paie to king Edward, the summe of one hundred thousand markes
starling, and thereto destroie all his holdes and fortresses standing
against the English borders, and further assure the crowne of Scotland
to the children of this king Edward for lacke of heire of his owne
bodie, all which things he did accordinglie. And for the better
assurance of his obeisance also, he afterward deliuered into the hands
of king Edward sundrie noble men of Scotland in this behalfe as his
pledges. This is the effect of the historie of Dauid, touching his
delings. Now let vs sée what was doone by Edward Balioll, wherof our
chronicles doo report, that in the yéere of our Lord 1326, Edward the
third, king of England, was crowned at Westminster, and in the fift
yeare of his reigne Edward Balioll right heire to the kingdome of
Scotland came in, and claimed it as due to him. Sundrie lords and
gentlemen also, which had title to diuerse lands there, either by
themselues, or by their wiues, did the like. Wherevpon the said Balioll
and they went into Scotland by sea, and landing at Kinghorne with 3000
Englishmen, discomfited 10000 Scots, and slue 1200, and then went foorth
to Dunfermeline, where the Scots assembled against them with 40000 men,
and in the feast of saint Laurence, at a place called Gastmore (or
otherwise Gladmore) were slaine fiue earls, thirtéene barons, a hundred
and thrée score knights, two thousand men of armes, and manie other; in
all fortie thousand: and there were slaine on the English part but
thirtéene persons onelie, if the number be not corrupted.</p>

<p>In the eight yeare of the reigne of king Edward, he assembled a great
hoast, and came to Berwike vpon Twéed, and laid siege therto. To him
also came Edward Balioll king of Scots, with a great power to strengthen
&amp; aid him against the Scots, who came out of Scotland in foure batels
well armed &amp; araied.</p>

<p>Edward king of England, and Edward king of Scots, apparrelled their
people either of them in foure battels: and vpon Halidon hill, beside
Berwike, met these two hoasts, and there were discomfited of the Scots
fiue and twentie thousand and seauen hundred, whereof were slaine eight
earles, a thousand and thrée hundred knights and gentlemen. This
victorie doone, the king returned to Berwike, &amp; then the towne with the
castell were yéelded vp vnto him. In the eight yeare of the reigne of
king Edward of England, Edward Balioll king of Scots came to Newcastell
vpon Tine, and did homage for all the realme of Scotland.</p>

<p>In the yeare of our Lord 1346, Dauid Bruse by the prouocation of the
king of France rebelled, and came into England with a great hoast vnto
<span class="page"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[Page 213]</span>
Neuils crosse: but the archbishop of Yorke, with diuerse temporall men,
fought with him; and the said king of Scots was taken, and William earle
of Duglas with Morrise earle of Strathorne were brought to London, and
manie other lords slaine, which with Dauid did homage to Edward king of
England.</p>

<p>And in the thirtith yeare of the kings reigne, and the yeare of our Lord
1355, the Scots woone the towne of Berwicke, but not the castell.
Herevpon the king came thither with a great hoast, and anon the towne
was yéelded vp without anie resistance.</p>

<p>Edward Balioll, considering that God did so manie maruellous and
gratious things for king Edward, at his owne will gaue vp the crowne and
the realme of Scotland to king Edward of England at Rokesborough, by his
letters patents. And anon after the king of England, in presence of all
his lords spirituall and temporall, let crowne himselfe king there of
the realme of Scotland, &amp; ordeined all things to his intent, and so came
ouer into England.</p>

<p>Richard the sonne of Edward, called the Blacke prince, sonne of this
king Edward, was next king of England, who for that the said Iane, the
wife of the said king Dauid of Scotland was deceassed without issue, and
being informed how the Scots deuised to their vttermost power to breake
the limitation of this inheritance touching the crowne of Scotland, made
foorthwith war against them, wherein he burnt Edenbrough, spoiled all
their countrie, tooke all their holds, &amp; held continuallie war against
them vntill his death, which was Anno Dom. 1389.</p>

<p>Henrie the fourth of that name was next king of England, he continued
these warres begun against them by king Richard, and ceassed not vntill
Robert king of Scots (the third of that name) resigned his crowne by
appointment of this king Henrie, and deliuered his sonne Iames, being
then of the age of nine yeares, into his hands to remaine at his
custodie, wardship and disposition, as of his superiour lord, according
to the old lawes of king Edward the confessor. All this was doone Anno
Dom. 1404, which was within fiue yeares after the death of king Richard.
This Henrie the fourth reigned in this estate ouer them fouretéene
yeares.</p>

<p>Henrie the fift of that name, sonne to this king Henrie the fourth, was
next king of England. He made warres against the French king, in all
which this Iames then king of Scots attended vpon him, as vpon his
superiour lord, with a conuenient number of Scots, notwithstanding their
league with France. But this Henrie reigned but nine yeares, whereby the
homage of this Iames their king (hauing not fullie accomplished the age
of one &amp; twentie yeares) was by reason and law respited. Finallie the
said Iames with diuerse other lords attended vpon the corps of the said
Henrie vnto Westminster, as to his dutie apperteined.</p>

<p>Henrie the sixt, the sonne of this Henrie the fift, was next king of
England, to whome the seigniorie of Scotland &amp; custodie of this Iames by
right, law, and reason descended, married the same Iames king of Scots
to Iane daughter of Iohn earle of Summerset, at saint Marie ouer Ise in
Southwarke, and tooke for the value of this mariage, the summe of one
hundred thousand markes starling.</p>

<p>This Iames king of Scots at his full age, did homage to the same king
Henrie the sixt, for the kingdome of Scotland at Windsore, in the moneth
of Ianuarie.</p>

<p>Since which time, vntill the daies of king Henrie the seuenth,
grandfather to our souereigne ladie that now is, albeit this realme hath
béene molested with diuersitie of titles, in which vnmeet time neither
law nor reason admit prescription to the prejudice of anie right: yet
did king Edward the fourth next king of England, by preparation of war
against the Scots in the latter end of his reigne, sufficientlie by all
lawes induce to the continuance of his claime to the same superioritie
ouer them.</p>

<p>After whose death, vnto the beginning of the reigne of our souereigne
lord king Henrie the eight, excéeded not the number of seauen and
twentie yeares, about which time the impediment of our claime of the
Scots part, chanced by the nonage of Iames their last king which so
continued the space of one and twentie yeares. And like as his minoritie
was by all law and reason an impediment to himselfe to make homage; so
<span class="page"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[Page 214]</span>
was the same by like reason an impediment to the king of this realme to
demand anie, so that the whole time of intermission of our claime in the
time of the said king Henrie the eight, is deduced vnto the number of
thirteene yeares. And thus much for this matter.</p>

<small>OF THE WALL SOMETIME BUILDED FOR A PARTITION BETWEENE ENGLAND AND THE <br />PICTS AND SCOTS.</small><br />

CHAP. XXIII.</h3>

<p>Hauing hitherto discoursed vpon the title of the kings of England, vnto
the Scotish kingdome: I haue now thought good to adde herevnto the
description of two walles that were (in times past) limits vnto both the
said regions, and therefore to be touched in this first booke, as
generallie appertinent vnto the estate of the whole Iland; and no lesse
famous than that which Anastasius Dicorus made afterward from the Euxine
vnto the Thracian sea, conteining 420 furlongs in length, and twelue
foot in bredth, &amp; distant from Constantinople 280 furlongs, albeit that
of Hadrian was made of turffe and timber. The author therefore of the
<span class="leftnote">The first beginner of the Picts wall.</span>
first wall was Hadrian the emperour, who (as Ælius Spartianus saith)
erected the same of foure score miles in length, twelue foot in heigth,
and eight in bredth, to diuide the barbarous Britons from the more
ciuill sort, which then were generallie called by the name of Romans
ouer all.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The finisher of the wall.</span>
After his time Seuerus the emperour comming againe into this Ile (where
he had serued before in repression of the tumults here begun, after the
death of Lucius) amongst other things he made another wall (but of
stone) betwéene eightie and a hundred miles from the first, &amp; of thirtie
two miles in length, reaching on both sides also to the sea, of whome
the Britons called it S. Murseueri, or Gwall Seueri, that is, The wall
of Seuerus, or Seuerus dale, which later indureth vntill these daies in
fresh memorie, by reason of the ruines &amp; square stones there oft found,
whose inscriptions declare the authors of that worke. It is worthie the
noting also, how that in this voiage he lost 50000 men in the Scotish
side, by one occasion and other, which hinderance so incensed him, that
he determined vtterlie to extinguish their memorie from vnder heauen,
and had so doone in déed, if his life had indured but vntill another
<span class="leftnote">The wall goeth not streict by a line,
but in and out in manie places.</span>
yeare. Sextus Aurelius writing of Seuerus, addeth, how that the wall
made by this prince conteined two and thirtie miles, whereby the bredth
of this Iland there, and length of the wall conteineth onelie so manie
miles, as may be gathered by his words. But chéeflie for the length of
the wall, Spartianus who touching it among other things saith of Seuerus
as followeth: "Britanniam (quod maximum eius imperij decus est) muro per
transuersam insulam ducto, vtrinq; ad finem oceani muniuit," that is, He
fortified Britaine (which is one of the chéefe acts recorded of his
time) with a wall made ouerthwart the Ile, that reached on both sides
euen to the verie Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The stuffe of the wall.</span>
That this wall was of stone also, the ruines therof (which haue
ministred much matter to such as dwell néere therevnto in their
buildings) is triall sufficient. Heereby in like sort it commeth to
passe, that where the soile about it is least inhabited, there is most
mention of the said wall, which was wrought of squared stone, as vntill
this daie maie euidentlie be confirmed. Howbeit, these two walles were
not the onelie partitions betwéene these two kingdoms, sith Iulius
<span class="leftnote">Two other wals.</span>
Capitolinus in vita Antonini Pij dooth write of another that Lollius
Vrbicus made beyond the same, of turffe, in the time of the said prince,
who (for his victories in Britaine) was also called Britannicus, which
neuerthelesse was often throwne downe by the Scots, and eftsoones
repared againe, vntill it was giuen ouer and relinquished altogither. It
runneth (as I take it) also within the wall about an arrow shot from
that of stone: but how farre it went, as yet I cannot find. This onlie
remaineth certeine, that the walles made by Hadrian &amp; Seuerus, were
<span class="leftnote">A rampire.</span>
ditched with notable ditches and rampires made in such wise, that the
<span class="page"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[Page 215]</span>
Scotish aduersarie had much a doo to enter and scale the same in his
assaults. And yet for all this, I read that the Scots oftentimes pulled
downe great parcels of the same, to make their accesse more easie into
the south parts: but as it was eftsoons repared againe, so the last time
of all it was amended by the Romane soldiors, which came ouer verie
little before the time of Vortiger, at which season the land was in
maner left void of soldiors and munition. Betwixt Thirlewall and the
north Tine, are also in the waste grounds, manie parcels of that wall of
Seuerus yet standing, whereof the common people doo babble manie things.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The course of the wall from west to east.</span>
Beginning therefore with the course thereof, from the west sea, I find
that it runneth from Bolnesse to Burgh, about foure miles, and likewise
from thence within halfe a mile of Carleill, and lesse on the north
side, and beneath the confluence of the Peder and the Eden. From hence
it goeth to Terrebie, a village about a mile from Caerleill, then
through the baronie of Linstocke, and Gillesland, on the north side of
the riuer Irding or Arding, and a quarter of a mile from the abbeie of
Leuercost. Thence thrée miles aboue Leuercost, and aboue the confluence
of Arding, and the Pultrose becke (which diuideth Gillesland in
Cumberland, from south Tindale in Northumberland) it goeth to Thirlwall
castell, then to the wall towne, next of all ouer the riuer to Swensheld,
Carraw (peraduenture Cairuoren tower) to Walwijc, and so ouer south
Tine, to Cockelie tower, Portgate, Halton sheles, Winchester, Rutchester,
Heddon, Walhottle, Denton, and to Newcastell, where it is thought that
saint Nicholas church standeth on the same. Howbeit Leland saith, that
it goeth within a mile of Newcastell, and then crooketh vp toward
Tinmouth vnto Wallesend, three miles from the mouth of the said riuer,
so called bicause the aforesaid wall did end at the same place. And thus
much I read of the Pictish wall. As for the Romane coine that is often
found in the course thereof, the curious bricks about the same néere
vnto Caerleill, beside the excellent cornellines and other costlie
stones alreadie intailed for seales oftentimes taken vp in those
quarters, I passe them ouer as not incident to my purpose.</p>

<p>In like maner I would gladlie also haue set downe the course of Offaes
ditch, which was march betwéene the Mercian dominions, and the Welshmen
in his time: but for so much as the tractation thereof is not to be
reférred to this place, bicause it is not a thing generall to the whole
Iland, I omit to speake of that also. Yet thus much will I note here, as
well by the report of one (who saith how he did tread it out) that he
followed it from the Dee to Kirnaburgh hill through Treuelach forrest,
by est of Crekith Cauchhill, Montgomerie castell, the New castell and
Discoid, and hauing brought it hitherto, either lost it, or sought after
it no further: as by the testimonie of another, who writing thereof,
saith, that it stretched from the south side by Bristow, along vnder the
mounteins of Wales northwards, ouer the riuer of Sauerne, and to the
verie mouth also of the Dée, where it falleth into the sea. And so much
of such things as concerne the generall estate of the whole Iland, which
labour herein I could verie well haue spared, and would, if Quintus had
performed the request of Cicero his brother, who promised to send him
ouer a sound aduertisement of the condition of Britaine in those daies:
as appeareth in the second booke of his familiar epistles, where he
saith; "Modò mihi date Britanniam, quam pingam coloribus tuis penicillo
meo, &amp;c." But sithence that was not performed, and the treatise of
Demetrius and other of the same argument are perished, which were of
some value, let this trifle (I beseech you) not be reiected, till some
other man of better skill shall haue drawne a more absolute péece of
workemanship, wherevnto my vnskilfulnesse (I hope) shall prooue no
hinderance.</p>

<small>OF THE MARUELS OF ENGLAND.</small><br />

CHAP. XXIV.</h3>

<p>Such as haue written of the woonders of our countrie in old time, haue
spoken (no doubt) of manie things, which deserue no credit at all: and
therefore in séeking thankes of their posteritie by their trauell in
this behalfe; they haue reaped the reward of iust reproch, and in stéed
of fame purchased vnto themselues nought else but méere discredit in
their better and more learned treatises. The like commonlie happeneth
also to such, as in respect of lucre doo publish vnprofitable and
pernicious volumes, wherby they doo consume their times in vaine, and in
manifold wise become preiudiciall vnto their common wealths. For my part
I will not touch anie man herein particularlie, no not our Demetrius, of
whom Plutarch speaketh in his oracles (if those bookes were written by
him, for some thinke that Plutarch neuer wrote them, although Eusebius
lib. 4. cap. 8. dooth acknowledge them to be his) which Demetrius left
sundrie treatises behind him, conteining woonderfull things collected of
our Iland. But sith that in my time they are found to be false, it
should be far vnmeet to remember them anie more: for who is he which
will beléeue, that infernall spirits can die and giue vp their ghosts
like mortall men? though Saxo séeme to consent vnto him in this behalfe.
In speaking also of the out Iles, he saith thus: Beyond Britaine are
manie desolate Ilands, whereof some are dedicated to the Gods, some to
the noble Heroes. I sailed (saith he) by the helpe of the king vnto one
that laie néere hand, onelie to see and view the same, in which I found
few inhabitants, and yet such as were there, were reputed and taken for
men of great pietie and holinesse. During the time also that I remained
in the same, it was vexed with great storme and tempest, which caused me
not a little to doubt of my safe returne. In the end, demanding of the
inhabitants what the cause should be of this so great and sudden
mutation of the aire? they answered, that either some of the Gods, or at
the least of the Heroes were latelie deceased: for as a candle (said
they) hurteth none whilest it burneth, but being slenderlie put out
annoieth manie with the filthie sauour: so these Gods, whilest they
liued, were either not hurtfull, or verie beneficiall to mankind; but
being once deceassed, they so mooue the heauens and aire, that much
mischéefe dooth insue eftsoones vpon the same.</p>

<p>Being also inquisitiue of the state of other Iles not farre off, they
told him further, how there was one hard by, wherein Saturne being
ouertaken with a dead sléepe, was watched by Briareus as he laie, which
Saturne also had manie spirits attending vpon him in sundrie functions
and offices. By which reports it is easie to conceiue, with what vaine
stuffe that volume of Demetrius is interlaced. But of such writers as we
haue too too manie, so among the said rable Geruase of Tilberie is not
the least famous, a man as it were euen sold to vtter matters of more
admiration than credit to the world. For what a tale telleth he in his
De otio imperiali, of Wandleburie hilles, that lie within sight &amp; by
south of Cambridge (where the Vandals incamped sometime, when they
entered into this Iland) and of a spirit that would of custome in a
moone shine night (if he were chalenged and called therevnto) run at
tilt and turneie in complet armor with anie knight or gentleman
whomsoeuer, in that place: and how one Osbert of Barnewell, hearing the
report thereof, armed himselfe, and being well mounted, rode thither
alone with one esquier, and called for him, who foorthwith appeared in
rich armour, and answered his chalenge, so that running togither verie
fiercelie, they met with such rigor, that the answerer was ouerthrowne
and borne downe to the ground. After this they bickered on foot so long,
till Osbert ouercame and draue him to flight, who departed, leauing his
horsse behind him, which was of huge stature, blacke (as he saith) of
colour, with his furniture of the same hue, and wherevpon he seized,
giuing him vnto his page, who caried him home, and there kept him till
it was néere daie, during which space he was séene of manie. But when
<span class="page"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[Page 217]</span>
the daie light began to shew it selfe somewhat cléere, the beast stamped
and snorted, and foorthwith breaking his raine, he ran awaie, and was no
more heard of to his knowledge in that countrie. In the meane season
Osbert being verie faint, and waxing wearie (for he was sore wounded in
the thigh, which either he knew not of, or at the leastwise dissembled
to know it) caused his leg-harnesse or stéele bootes to be pulled off,
which his fréends saw to be full of bloud spilled in the voiage. But let
who so list beléeue it, sith it is either a fable deuised, or some
diuelish illusion, if anie such thing were doone. And on mine owne
behalfe, hauing (I hope) the feare of God before my eies, I purpose here
to set downe no more than either I know my selfe to be true, or am
crediblie informed to be so, by such godly men, as to whom nothing is
more deare than to speake the truth, and not anie thing more odious than
to discredit themselues by lieng. In writing therefore of the woonders
<span class="leftnote">Foure woonders of England.</span>
of England, I find that there are foure notable things, which for their
rarenesse amongst the common sort, are taken for the foure miracles and
woonders of the land.</p>

<p>The first of these is a vehement and strong wind, which issueth out of
the hilles called the Peke, so violent and strong, that at certeine
times if a man doo cast his cote or cloake into the caue from whence it
issueth, it driueth the same backe againe, hoising it aloft into the
open aire with great force and vehemencie. Of this also Giraldus
speaketh.</p>

<p>The second is the miraculous standing or rather hanging of certeine
stones vpon the plaine of Salisburie, whereof the place is called
Stonehenge. And to saie the truth, they may well be woondered at, not
onelie for the manner of position, whereby they become verie difficult
to be numbred, but also for their greatnesse &amp; strange maner of lieng of
some of them one vpon another, which séemeth to be with so tickle hold,
that few men go vnder them without feare of their present ruine. How and
when these stones were brought thither, as yet I can not read; howbeit
it is most likelie, that they were raised there by the Britons, after
the slaughter of their nobilitie at the deadlie banket, which Hengist
and his Saxons prouided for them, where they were also buried, and
Vortigerne their king apprehended and led awaie as captiue. I haue heard
that the like are to be séene in Ireland; but how true it is as yet I
can not learne. The report goeth also, that these were broght from
thence, but by what ship on the sea, and cariage by land, I thinke few
men can safelie imagine.</p>

<p>The third is an ample and large hole vnder the ground, which some call
Carcer Acoli, but in English Chedderhole, whereinto manie men haue
entred &amp; walked verie farre. Howbeit, as the passage is large and
nothing noisome: so diuerse that haue aduentured to go into the same,
could neuer as yet find the end of that waie, neither sée anie other
thing than pretie riuerets and streames, which they often crossed as
they went from place to place. This Chedderhole or Chedder rocke is in
Summersetshire, and thence the said waters run till they méet with the
second Ax that riseth in Owkie hole.</p>

<p>The fourth is no lesse notable than anie of the other. For westward vpon
certeine hilles a man shall sée the clouds gather togither in faire
weather vnto a certeine thicknesse, and by and by to spread themselues
abroad and water their fields about them, as it were vpon the sudden.
The causes of which dispersion, as they are utterlie vnknowne: so manie
men coniecture great store of water to be in those hilles, &amp; verie néere
at hand, if it were néedfull to be sought for.</p>

<p>Besides these foure maruelles, there is a little rockie Ile in Aber
Barrie (a riueret that falleth into the Sauerne sea) called Barrie,
which hath a rift or clift next the first shore; wherevnto if a man doo
laie his eare, he shall heare such noises as are commonlie made in
smiths forges, to wit, clinking of iron barres, beating with hammers,
blowing of bellowses, and such like: whereof the superstitious sort doo
gather manie toies, as the gentiles did in old time of their lame god
Vulcans pot. The riuer that runneth by Chester changeth hir chanell
euerie moneth: the cause whereof as yet I can not learne; neither dooth
it swell by force of anie land-floud, but by some vehement wind it oft
ouer-runneth hir banks. In Snowdonie are two lakes, whereof one beareth
a moouable Iland, which is carried to and fro as the wind bloweth. The
<span class="page"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[Page 218]</span>
other hath thrée kinds of fishes in it, as éeles, trowts, and perches:
but herein resteth the woonder, that all those haue but one eie a péece
onelie, and the same situate in the right side of their heads. And this
I find to be confirmed also by authors: There is a well in the forrest
of Gnaresborow, whereof the said forrest dooth take the name; which
water, beside that it is cold as Stix, in a certeine period of time
knowne, conuerteth wood, flesh, leaues of trées, and mosse into hard
stone, without alteration or changing of shape. The like also is séene
there in frogs, wormes, and such like liuing creatures as fall into the
same, and find no readie issue. Of this spring also Leland writeth thus;
A little aboue March (but at the further banke of Nide riuer as I came)
I saw a well of wonderfull nature called Dropping well, because the
water thereof distilleth out of great rockes hard by into it
continuallie, which is so cold, and thereto of such nature, that what
thing soeuer falleth out of those rocks into this pit, or groweth néere
thereto, or be cast into it by mans hand, it turneth into stone. It may
be (saith he) that some sand or other fine ground issueth out with this
water from these hard rocks, which cleauing vnto those things, giueth
them in time the forme of stones &amp;c. Néere vnto the place where Winburne
monasterie sometimes stood, also not farre from Bath there is a faire
wood, whereof if you take anie péece, and pitch it into the ground
thereabouts, or throw it into the water, within twelue moneths it will
turne into hard stone. In part of the hilles east southeast of
Alderleie, a mile from Kingswood, are stones dailie found, perfectlie
fashioned like cockles and mightie oisters, which some dreame haue lien
there euer since the floud. In the clifts betwéene the Blacke head and
Trewardeth baie in Cornwall, is a certeine caue, where things appeare
like images guilded, on the sides of the same, which I take to be
nothing but the shining of the bright ore of coppar and other mettals
readie at hand to be found there, if anie diligence were vsed. Howbeit,
because it is much maruelled at as a rare thing, I doo not thinke it to
be vnméet to be placed amongst our woonders. Maister Guise had of late,
and still hath (for aught that I know) a manor in Glocestershire, where
certeine okes doo grow, whose rootes are verie hard stone. And beside
this, the ground is so fertile there (as they saie) that if a man hew a
stake of anie wood, and pitch it into the earth, it will grow and take
rooting beyond all expectation. Siluecester towne also is said to
conteine fourescore acres of land within the walles, whereof some is
corne-ground (as Leland saith) and the graine which is growing therein
dooth come to verie good perfection till it be readie to be cut downe:
but euen then, or about that time it vanisheth away &amp; becommeth
altogither vnprofitable. Is it any woonder (thinke you) to tell of
sundrie caues néere to Browham, on the west side of the riuer Aimote,
wherein are halles, chambers, and all offices of houshold cut out of the
hard rocke? If it be, then may we increase the number of maruels verie
much by a rehearsall of other also. For we haue manie of the like, as
one néere saint Assaphs vpon the banke of Elwie, and about the head of
Vendrath Vehan in Wales, whereinto men haue often entred and walked, and
yet found nothing but large roomes, and sandie ground vnder their féet,
and other else-where. But sith these things are not strange, I let them
alone, and go forward with the rest.</p>

<p>In the parish of Landsarnam in Wales, and in the side of a stonie hill,
is a place wherein are foure and twentie seats hewen out of the hard
rockes; but who did cut them, and to what end, as yet it is not learned.
As for the huge stone that lieth at Pember in Guitherie parish, and of
the notable carcasse that is affirmed to lie vnder the same, there is no
cause to touch it here: yet were it well doone to haue it remoued,
though it were but onlie to sée what it is, which the people haue in so
great estimation &amp; reuerence. There is also a poole in Logh Taw, among
the blacke mounteins in Brecknockshire, where (as is said) is the head
of Taw that commeth to Swanseie, which hath such a propertie, that it
will bréed no fish at all, &amp; if anie be cast into it, they die without
recouerie: but this peraduenture may grow throgh the accidentall
corruption of the water, rather than the naturall force of the element
it selfe. There is also a lin in Wales, which in the one side beareth
trowts so red as samons, and in the other, which is the westerlie side,
<span class="page"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[Page 219]</span>
verie white and delicate. I heare also of two welles not far from
Landien, which stand verie néere togither, and yet are of such
diuersitie of nature, that the one beareth sope, and is a maruellous
fine water; the other altogither of contrarie qualities. Which is not a
litle to be mused at, considering (I saie) that they participate of one
soile, and rise so nigh one to another. I haue notice giuen me moreouer
of a stone not farre from saint Dauids, which is verie great, as a bed,
or such like thing: and being raised vp, a man may stirre it with his
thumbe; but not with his shoulder or force of his whole bodie.</p>

<p>There is a well not farre from stonie Stratford, which conuerteth manie
things into stone; and an other in Wales, which is said to double or
triple the force of anie edge toole that is quenched in the same. In
Tegenia, a parcell of Wales, there is a noble well (I meane in the
parish of Kilken) which is of maruellous nature, and much like to
another well at Seuill in Spaine: for although it be six miles from the
sea, it ebbeth and floweth twise in one daie; alwaies ebbing when the
sea dooth vse to flow, and in flowing likewise when the sea dooth vse to
ebbe; wherof some doo fable, that this well is ladie and mistresse of
the ocean. Not farre from thence also is a medicinable spring called
Schinant of old time, but now Wenefrides well, in the edges whereof
dooth breed a verie odoriferous and delectable mosse, wherewith the head
of the smeller is maruellouslie refreshed. Other welles and
water-courses we haue likewise, which at some times burst out into huge
streames, though at other seasons they run but verie softlie, whereby
the people gather some alteration of estate to be at hand. And such a
one there is at Henleie, &amp; an other at Croidon; &amp; such a one also in the
golden dale beside Anderne in Picardie, whereof the common sort imagine
manie things. Some of the greater sort also giue ouer to run at all in
such times, wherof they conceiue the like opinion. And of the same
nature, though of no great quantitie, is a pit or well at Langleie parke
in Kent, whereof (by good hap) it was my lucke to read a notable
historie in an ancient chronicle that I saw of late. What the foolish
people dreame of the hell Kettles, it is not worthie the rehearsall; yet
to the end the lewd opinion conceiued of them may grow into contempt, I
will saie thus much also of those pits. There are certeine pits, or
rather three little pooles, a mile from Darlington, and a quarter of a
mile distant from the These banks which the people call the Kettles of
hell, or the diuels Kettles, as if he should séeth soules of sinfull men
and women in them. They adde also, that the spirits haue oft beene heard
to crie and yell about them, with other like talke sauoring altogether
of pagan infidelitie. The truth is, and of this opinion also was Cutbert
Tunstall late bishop of Durham, a man (notwithstanding the basenesse of
his birth, being begotten by one Tunstall vpon a daughter of the house
of the Commers, as Leland saith) of great learning and iudgement, that
the cole-mines in those places are kindled, or if there be no coles,
there may a mine of some other vnctuous matter be set on fire, which
being here and there consumed, the earth falleth in, and so dooth leaue
a pit. Indéed the water is now and then warme (as they saie) and beside
that it is not cléere: the people suppose them to be an hundred fadam
déepe. The biggest of them also hath an issue into the These, as
experience hath confirmed. For doctor Bellowes aliàs Belzis made report,
how a ducke marked after the fashion of the duckes of the bishoprike of
Durham, was put into the same betwixt Darlington and These banke, and
afterward séene at a bridge not farre from master Clereuax house. If it
were woorth the noting, I would also make relation of manie wooden
crosses found verie often about Halidon, whereof the old inhabitants
conceiued an opinion that they were fallen from heauen; whereas in
truth, they were made and borne by king Oswald; and his men in the
battell wherein they preuailed sometimes against the British infidels,
vpon a superstitious imagination, that those crosses should be their
defense and shield against their aduersaries. Beda calleth the place
where the said field was fought, Heauen field; it lieth not far from the
Pictish wall, and the famous monasterie of Hagulstad. But more of this
elsewhere. Neither will I speak of the little hillets séene in manie
places of our Ile, whereof though the vnskilfull people babble manie
things: yet are they nothing else but Tumuli or graues of former times,
as appeareth by such tooms &amp; carcasses as be daily found in the same,
<span class="page"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[Page 220]</span>
when they be digged downe. The like fond imagination haue they of a kind
of lunarie, which is to be found in manie places, although not so well
knowen by the forme vnto them, as by the effect thereof, because it now
and then openeth the lockes hanging on the horses féet as hit vpon it
where it groweth in their féeding. Roger Bacon our countrieman noteth it
to grow plentiouslie in Tuthill fields about London. I haue heard of it
to be within compasse of the parish where I dwell, and doo take it for
none other than the Sfera Cauallo, whereof Mathiolus and the herbarists
doo write, albeit that it hath not béene my lucke at anie time to behold
it. Plinie calleth it Aethiopis: and Aelianus, Oppianus, Kyramis, and
Trebius haue written manie superstitious things thereof, but especiallie
our Chymists, who make it of farre more vertue than our smiths doo their
ferne séed, whereof they babble manie woonders, and prate of such
effects as may well be performed indéed when the ferne beareth séed,
which is commonly Ad calendas Græcas, for before it will not be found.
But to procéed. There is a well in Darbieshire called Tideswell (so
named of the word tide, or to ebbe and flow) whose water often séemeth
to rise and fall, as the sea which is fortie miles from it dooth
vsuallie accustome to ebbe and flow. And hereof an opinion is growen
that it kéepeth an ordinarie course as the sea dooth. Howbeit, sith
diuerse are knowne to haue watched the same, it may be that at sometimes
it riseth, but not continuallie; and that it so dooth I am fullie
persuaded to beléeue. But euen inough of the woonders of our countrie,
least I doo seeme by talking longer of them, woonderouslie to ouershoot
my selfe, and forget how much dooth rest behind of the description of my
countrie. As for those that are to be touched of Scotland, the
description of that part shall in some part remember them.</p>

<small>OF THE ANCIENT AND PRESENT ESTATE OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND.</small><br />

CHAP. I.</h3>

<p>There are now two prouinces onelie in England, of which the first and
greatest is subiect to the sée of Canturburie, comprehending a parte of
Lhoegres, whole Cambria, &amp; also Ireland, which in time past were
seuerall, &amp; brought into one by the archbishop of the said sée &amp;
assistance of the pope; who in respect of méed, did yéeld vnto the
ambitious desires of sundrie archbishops of Canturburie, as I haue
elsewhere declared. The second prouince is vnder the sée of Yorke, and
of these; either hath hir archbishop resident commonlie within hir owne
limits, who hath not onelie the cheefe dealing in matters apperteining
to the hierarchie and iurisdiction of the church; but also great
authoritie in ciuill affaires touching the gouernement of the common
wealth: so far foorth as their commissions and seuerall circuits doo
extend.</p>

<p>In old time there were thrée archbishops, and so manie prouinces in this
Ile; of which one kept at London, another at Yorke, and the third at
Caerlheon vpon Uske. But as that of London was translated to Canturburie
by Augustine, and that of Yorke remaineth (notwithstanding that the
<span class="page"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[Page 222]</span>
greatest part of his iurisdiction is now bereft him and giuen to the
Scotish archbishop) so that of Caerlheon is vtterlie extinguished, and
the gouernement of the countrie vnited to that of Canturburie in
spirituall cases: after it was once before remoued to S. Dauids in Wales
by Dauid successor to Dubritius, and vncle to king Arthur, in the 519 of
Grace, to the end that he and his clearkes might be further off from the
crueltie of the Saxons, where it remained till the time of the Bastard,
and for a season after, before it was annexed vnto the sée of
Canturburie.</p>

<p>The archbishop of Canturburie is commonlie called primat of all England;
and in the coronations of the kings of this land, and all other times,
wherein it shall please the prince to weare and put on his crowne, his
office is to set it vpon their heads. They beare also the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'uame'">name</ins> of their
high chapleins continuallie, although not a few of them haue presumed
(in time past) to be their equals, and void of subiection vnto them.
That this is true, it may easilie appéere by their owne acts yet kept in
record; beside their epistles &amp; answers written or in print; wherein
they haue sought not onelie to match but also to mate them with great
rigor and more than open tyrannie. Our aduersaries will peraduenture
denie this absolutelie, as they doo manie other things apparant, though
not without shamelesse impudencie, or at the leastwise defend it as iust
and not swaruing from common equitie; bicause they imagine euerie
archbishop to be the kings equall in his owne prouince. But how well
their dooing herein agreeth with the saieng of Peter, &amp; examples of the
primitiue church, it may easilie appéere. Some examples also of their
demeanor (I meane in the time of poperie) I will not let to remember,
least they should saie I speake of malice, and without all ground of
likelihood.</p>

<p>Of their practises with meane persons I speake not, neither will I begin
at Dunstane the author of all their pride and presumption here in
England. But for somuch as the dealing of Robert the Norman against
earle Goodwine is a rare historie, and deserueth to be remembred, I will
touch it in this place; protesting to deale withall in more faithfull
maner than it hath heretofore beene deliuered vnto vs by the Norman
writers, or French English, who (of set purpose) haue so defaced earle
Goodwine, that were it not for the testimonie of one or two méere
Englishmen liuing in those daies, it should be impossible for me (or
anie other) at this present to declare the truth of that matter
according to hir circumstances. Marke therefore what I saie. For the
truth is, that such Normans as came in with Emma in the time of
Ethelred, and Canutus, and the Confessor, did fall by sundrie means into
such fauor with those princes, that the gentlemen did grow to beare
great rule in the court, and their clearkes to be possessors of the best
benefices in the land. Hervpon therefore one Robert, a iolie ambitious
préest, gat first to be bishop of London, and after the death of
Eadsius, to be archbishop of Canturburie by the gift of king Edward;
leauing his former sée to William his countrieman. Ulfo also a Norman
was preferred to Lincolne, and other to other places, as the king did
thinke conuenient.</p>

<p>These Norman clerkes, and their freends, being thus exalted, it was not
long yer they began to mocke, abuse, and despise the English: and so
much the more, as they dailie saw themselues to increase in fauour with
king Edward, who also called diuerse of them to be of his secret
councell, which did not a litle incense the harts of the English against
them. A fraie also was made at Douer, betwéene the seruants of earle
Goodwine and the French, whose maisters came ouer to see and salute the
king: whereof I haue spoken in my Chronologie, which so inflamed the
minds of the French cleargie and courtiers against the English
nobilitie, that each part sought for opportunitie of reuenge, which yer
long tooke hold betwéene them. For the said Robert, being called to be
archbishop of Canturburie, was no sooner in possession of his sée, than
he began to quarrell with earle Goodwine (the kings father in law by the
mariage of his daughter) who also was readie to acquit his demeanor with
like malice; and so the mischiefe begun. Herevpon therefore the
archbishop charged the earle with the murther of Alfred the kings
brother, whom not he but Harald the sonne of Canutus and the Danes had
cruellie made awaie. For Alfred and his brother comming into the land
<span class="page"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[Page 223]</span>
with fiue and twentie saile, vpon the death of Canutus, and being
landed; the Normans that arriued with them giuing out how they came to
recouer their right, to wit, the crowne of England; &amp; therevnto the
vnskilfull yoong gentlemen, shewing themselues to like of the rumour
that was spred in this behalfe, the report of their demeanor was
quicklie brought to Harald, who caused a companie foorthwith of Danes
priuilie to laie wait for them, as they roade toward Gilford, where
Alfred was slaine, and whence Edward with much difficultie escaped to
his ships, and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'to'">so</ins> returned into Normandie.</p>

<p>But to proceed. This affirmation of the archbishop being greatlie
soothed out with his craftie vtterance (for he was lerned) confirmed by
his French fréends, (for they had all conspired against the erle) and
therevnto the king being desirous to reuenge the death of his brother,
bred such a grudge in his mind against Goodwine, that he banished him
and his sons cleane out of the land. He sent also his wife the erles
daughter prisoner to Wilton, with one onelie maiden attending vpon hir,
where she laie almost a yeare before she was released. In the meane
season, the rest of the peeres, as Siward earle of Northumberland
surnamed Digara or Fortis, Leofrijc earle of Chester, and other went to
the king, before the departure of Goodwine, indeuouring to persuade him
vnto the reuocation of his sentence; and desiring that his cause might
be heard and discussed by order of law. But the king incensed by the
archbishop and his Normans would not heare on that side, saieng
plainelie, and swearing by saint Iohn the euangelist (for that was his
common oth) that earle Goodwine should not haue his peace till he
restored his brother Alfred aliue againe vnto his presence. With which
answer the peeres departed in choler from the court, and Goodwine toward
the coast.</p>

<p>Comming also vnto the shore and readie to take shipping, he knéeled
downe in presence of his conduct (to wit at Bosenham in the moneth of
September, from whence he intended to saile into Flanders vnto Baldwine
the earle) and there praied openlie before them all, that if euer he
attempted anie thing against the kings person of England, or his roiall
estate, that he might neuer come safe vnto his cousine, nor sée his
countrie any more, but perish in this voiage. And herewith he went
aboord the ship that was prouided for him, and so from the coast into
the open sea. But sée what followed. He was not yet gone a mile waie
from the land, before he saw the shore full of armed souldiers, sent
after by the archbishop and his freends to kill him yer he should depart
and go out of the countrie: which yet more incensed the harts of the
English against them.</p>

<p>Being come also to Flanders, he caused the earle, the French king, and
other of his fréends, among whome also the emperour was one, to write
vnto the king in his behalfe; but all in vaine: for nothing could be
obteined from him, of which the Normans had no liking, wherevpon the
earle and his sonnes changed their minds, obteined aid, and inuaded the
land in sundry places. Finallie ioining their powers they came by the
Thames into Southwarke néere London where they lodged, and looked for
the king to incounter with them in the field. The king séeing what was
doone, commanded the Londoners not to aid nor vittell them. But the
citizens made answer, how the quarrell of Goodwine was the cause of the
whole realme, which he had in maner giuen ouer vnto the spoile of the
French: and therevpon they not onelie vittelled them aboundantlie, but
also receiued the earle and his chiefe fréends into the citie, where
they lodged them at their ease, till the kings power was readie to ioine
with them in battell.</p>

<p>Great resort also was made vnto them from all places of the realme, so
that the earles armie was woonderfullie increased, and the daie and
place chosen wherein the battell should be fought. But when the armies
met, the kings side began some to flée to the earle, other to laie downe
their weapons, and not a few to run awaie out right; the rest telling
him plainelie that they would neuer fight against their owne
countriemen, to mainteine Frenchmens quarrels. The Normans also seeing
the sequele, fled awaie so fast as they might gallop, leauing the king
in the field to shift for himselfe (as he best might) whilest they did
saue themselues elsewhere.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[Page 224]</span></p>

<p>In the meane season the earles power would haue set vpon the king,
either to his slaughter, or apprehension; but he staied them, saieng
after this maner: The king is my sonne (as you all know) and it is not
for a father to deale so hardlie with his child, neither a subiect with
his souereigne; it is not he that hath hurt or doone me this iniurie,
but the proud Normans that are about him: wherfore to gaine a kingdome,
I will doo him no violence. And therewithall casting aside his battell
ax he ran to the king, that stood altogither amazed, and falling at his
féet he craued his peace, accused the archbishop, required that his
cause might be heard in open assemblie of his péeres; and finallie
determined as truth and equitie should deserue.</p>

<p>The king (after he had paused a pretie while) seeing his old father in
law to lie groueling at his féet, and conceiuing with himselfe that his
sute was not vnreasonable; seeing also his children, and the rest of the
greatest barons of the land to knéele before him, and make the like
request: he lifted vp the earle by the hand, bad him be of good comfort,
pardoned all that was past, and freendlie hauing kissed him and his
sonnes vpon the chéekes, he lead them to his palace, called home the
quéene, and summoned all his lords vnto a councell.</p>

<p>Wherein it is much to read, how manie billes were presented against the
bishop &amp; his Normans; some conteining matter of rape, other of robberie,
extortion, murder, manslaughter, high treason, adulterie; and not a few
of batterie. Wherwith the king (as a man now awaked out of sléepe) was
so offended, that vpon consultation had of these things, he banished all
the Normans out of the land, onelie thrée or foure excepted, whome he
reteined for sundrie necessarie causes, albeit they came neuer more so
néere him afterward as to be of his priuie councell.</p>

<p>After this also the earle liued almost two yeares, and then falling into
an apoplexie, as he sat with the king at the table, he was taken vp and
carried into the kings bedchamber, where (after a few daies) he made an
end of his life. And thus much of our first broile raised by the
cleargie, and practise of the archbishop. I would intreat of all the
like examples of tyrannie, practised by the prelats of this sée, against
their lords and souereignes: but then I should rather write an historie
than a description of this Iland.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Anselme.</span>
Wherefore I refer you to those reports of Anselme and Becket,
sufficientlie penned by other, the which Anselme also making a shew, as
if he had bin verie vnwilling to be placed in the sée of Canturburie,
gaue this answer to the letters of such his fréends, as did make request
vnto him to take the charge vpon him. "Secularia negotia nescio, quia
scire nolo, eorum námque occupationes horreo, liberum affectans animum.
Voluntati sacrarum intendo scripturarum, vos dissonantiam facitis,
verendúmque est nè aratrum sanctæ ecclesiæ, quod in Anglia duo boues
validi &amp; pari fortitudine, ad bonum certantes, id est rex &amp;
archiepiscopus, debeant trahere, nunc oue vetula cum tauro indomito
iugata, distorqueatur à recto. Ego ouis vetula, qui si quietus essem,
verbi Dei lacte, &amp; operimento lanæ, aliquibus possem fortassis non
ingratus esse, sed si me cum hoc tauro coniungitis, videbitis pro
disparilitate trahentium, aratrum non rectè procedere, &amp;c." Which is in
English thus: Of secular affaires I haue no skill, bicause I will not
know them, for I euen abhor the troubles that rise about them, as one
that desireth to haue his mind at libertie. I applie my whole indeuor to
the rule of the scriptures, you lead me to the contrarie. And it is to
be feared least the plough of holie church, which two strong oxen of
equall force, and both like earnest to contend vnto that which is good
(that is the king and the archbishop) ought to draw, should thereby now
swarue from the right forrow, by matching of an old shéepe with a wild
vntamed bull. I am that old shéepe, who if I might be quiet, could
peraduenture shew my selfe not altogither vngratfull to some, by féeding
them with the milke of the word of God, and couering them with wooll:
but if you match me with this bull, you shall sée that thorough want of
equalitie in draught the plough will not go to right, &amp;c: as foloweth in
<span class="leftnote">Thomas Becket.</span>
the processe of his letters. The said Thomas Becket was so proud, that he
wrote to king Henrie the second, as to his lord, to his king, and to his
sonne, offering him his counsell, his reuerence, and due correction, &amp;c.
Others in like sort haue protested, that they owght nothing to the kings
<span class="page"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[Page 225]</span>
of this land, but their counsell onelie, reseruing all obedience vnto
the sée of Rome.</p>

<p>And as the old cocke of Canturburie did crow in this behalfe, so the
yoong cockerels of other sées did imitate his demeanor, as may be séene
by this one example also in king Stephans time, worthie to be remembred;
vnto whome the bishop of London would not so much as sweare to be true
subiect: wherein also he was mainteined by the pope, as appeareth by
these letters.</p>

<p>Thus we sée, that kings were to rule no further than it pleased the pope
to like of; neither to chalenge more obedience of their subiects than
stood also with their good will and pleasure. He wrote in like sort vnto
quéene Mawd about the same matter, making hir Samsons calfe (the better
to bring his purpose to passe) as appeareth by the same letter here

<p>Is it not strange, that a peeuish order of religion (deuised by man)
should breake the expresse law of God, who commandeth all men to honour
and obeie their kings and princes, in whome some part of the power of
God is manifest and laid open vnto vs? And euen vnto this end the
cardinall of Hostia also wrote to the canons of Paules, after this
maner; couertlie incoraging them to stand to their election of the said
Robert, who was no more willing to giue ouer his new bishoprike, than
they carefull to offend the king; but rather imagined which waie to
kéepe it still maugre his displeasure: &amp; yet not to sweare obedience
vnto him, for all that he should be able to do or performe vnto the
contrarie.</p>

<p>Hereby you sée how king Stephan was dealt withall. And albeit the
archbishop of Canturburie is not openlie to be touched herewith, yet it
is not to be doubted, but he was a dooer in it, so far as might tend to
the maintenance of the right and prerogatiue of holie church. And euen
no lesse vnquietnesse had another of our princes with Iohn of Arundell,
who fled to Rome for feare of his head, and caused the pope to write an
ambitious and contumelious letter vnto his souereigne about his
restitution. But when (by the kings letters yet extant) &amp; beginning
thus; "Thomas proditionis non expers nostræ regiæ maiestati insidias
fabricauit," the pope vnderstood the botom of the matter, he was
contented that Thomas should be depriued, and another archbishop chosen
in his sted.</p>

<p>Neither did this pride staie at archbishops and bishops, but descended
lower, euen to the rake-helles of the clergie and puddels of all
vngodlinesse. For beside the iniurie receiued of their superiors, how
was K. Iohn dealt withall by the vile Cistertians at Lincolne in the
second of his reigne? Certes, when he had (vpon iust occasion) conceiued
some grudge against them for their ambitious demeanor; and vpon deniall
to paie such summes of moneie as were allotted vnto them, he had caused
seizure to be made of such horsses, swine, neate, and other things of
theirs, as were mainteined in his forrests. They denounced him as fast
amongst themselues with bell, booke and candle, to be accurssed and
excommunicated. Therevnto they so handled the matter with the pope and
their friends, that the king was faine to yéeld to their good graces:
insomuch that a meeting for pacification was appointed betwéene them at
Lincolne, by meanes of the present archbishop of Canturburie, who went
oft betweene him and the Cistertian commissioners before the matter
could be finished. In the end, the king himselfe came also vnto the said
commissioners as they sat in their chapiter house, and there with teares
fell downe at their feet, crauing pardon for his trespasses against
them, and heartilie requiring that they would (from thencefoorth)
commend him and his realme in their praiers vnto the protection of the
almightie, and receiue him into their fraternitie: promising moreouer
full satisfaction of their damages susteined; and to build an house of
their order in whatsoeuer place of England it should please them to
assigne. And this he confirmed by charter, bearing date the seauen and
twentith of Nouember, after the Scotish king was returned into Scotland,
&amp; departed from the king. Whereby (and by other the like, as betweene
Iohn Stratford and Edward the third, &amp;c:) a man may easilie conceiue how
proud the cleargie-men haue beene in former times, as wholie presuming
vpon the primassie of their pope. More matter could I alledge of these
and the like broiles, not to be found among our common historiographers:
howbeit reseruing the same vnto places more conuenient, I will ceasse to
speake of them at this time, and go forward with such other things as my
purpose is to speake of. At the first therefore there was like and
equall authoritie in both our archbishops: but as he of Canturburie hath
long since obteined the prerogatiue aboue Yorke (although I saie not
without great trouble, sute, some bloudshed &amp; contention) so the
archbishop of Yorke is neuerthelesse written primate of England, as one
contenting himselfe with a péece of a title at the least, when (all)
could not be gotten. And as he of Canturburie crowneth the king, so this
of Yorke dooth the like to the quéene, whose perpetuall chapleine he is,
&amp; hath beene from time to time, since the determination of this
controuersie, as writers doo report. The first also hath vnder his
<span class="page"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[Page 227]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Twentie one bishoprikes vnder the sée of Canturburie.
Onelie foure sées vnder the archbishop of Yorke.</span>
iurisdiction to the number of one and twentie inferiour bishops, the
other hath onlie foure, by reason that the churches of Scotland are now
remooued from his obedience vnto an archbishop of their owne, whereby
the greatnesse and circuit of the iurisdiction of Yorke is not a little
diminished. In like sort each of these seauen and twentie sées haue
<span class="leftnote">Deanes.</span>
their cathedrall churches, wherein the deanes (a calling not knowne in
England before the conquest) doo beare the chéefe rule, being men
especiallie chosen to that vocation, both for their learning and
godlinesse so néere as can be possible. These cathedrall churches haue
<span class="leftnote">Canonries.</span>
in like maner other dignities and canonries still remaining vnto them,
as héeretofore vnder the popish regiment. Howbeit those that are chosen
to the same are no idle and vnprofitable persons (as in times past they
haue béene when most of these liuings were either furnished with
strangers, especiallie out of Italie, boies, or such idiots as had least
skill of all in discharging of those functions, wherevnto they were
called by vertue of these stipends) but such as by preaching and
teaching can and doo learnedlie set foorth the glorie of God, and
further the ouerthrow of antichrist to the vttermost of their powers.</p>

<p>These churches are called cathedrall, bicause the bishops dwell or lie
néere vnto the same, as bound to keepe continuall residence within their
iurisdictions, for the better ouersight and gouernance of the same: the
word being deriued à cathedra, that is to saie a chaire or seat where he
resteth, and for the most part abideth. At the first there was but one
church in euerie iurisdiction, wherinto no man entred to praie, but with
some oblation or other toward the maintenance of the pastor. For as it
was reputed an infamie to passe by anie of them without visitation: so
it was a no lesse reproch to appeare emptie before the Lord. And for
this occasion also they were builded verie huge and great, for otherwise
they were not capable of such multitudes as came dailie vnto them, to
heare the word and receive the sacraments.</p>

<p>But as the number of christians increased, so first monasteries, then
finallie parish churches were builded in euerie iurisdiction: from
whence I take our deanerie churches to haue their originall, now called
mother churches, and their incumbents archpréests; the rest being added
since the conquest, either by the lords of euerie towne, or zealous men,
loth to trauell farre, and willing to haue some ease by building them
neere hand. Vnto these deanerie churches also the cleargie in old time
of the same deanrie were appointed to repaire at sundrie seasons, there
to receiue wholesome ordinances, and to consult vpon the necessarie
affaires of the whole iurisdiction; if necessitie so required: and some
image hereof is yet to be seene in the north parts. But as the number of
churches increased, so the repaire of the faithfull vnto the cathedrals
did diminish: whereby they now become especiallie in their nether parts
rather markets and shops for merchandize, than solemn places of praier,
wherevnto they were first erected. Moreouer in the said cathedrall
churches vpon sundaies and festiuall daies, the canons doo make certeine
<span class="leftnote">Ordinarie sermons.</span>
ordinarie sermons by course, wherevnto great numbers of all estates doo
orderlie resort: and vpon the working daies thrise in the wéeke, one of
the said canons, or some other in his stéed, dooth read and expound some
<span class="rightnote">Ordinarie expositions of the scriptures.</span>
péece of holie scripture, wherevnto the people doo verie reuerentlie
repaire. The bishops themselues in like sort are not idle in their
callings, for being now exempt from court and councell, which is one
(and a no small) péece of their felicitie (although Richard archbishop
of Canturburie thought otherwise, as yet appeareth by his letters to
pope Alexander, Epistola 44. Petri Blesensis, where he saith; Bicause
the cleargie of his time were somewhat narrowlie looked vnto, "Supra
<span class="leftnote">The bishops preach diligentlie, whose predecessors
heretofore haue béene occupied in temporall affairs.</span>
dorsum ecclesiæ fabricant peccatores, &amp;c:") they so applie their minds
to the setting foorth of the word, that there are verie few of them,
which doo not euerie sundaie or oftener resort to some place or other,
within their iurisdictions, where they expound the scriptures with much
grauitie and skill; and yet not without the great misliking and contempt
of such as hate the word. Of their manifold translations from one sée to
another I will saie nothing, which is not now doone for the benefit of
the flocke, as the preferment of the partie fauoured, and aduantage vnto
the prince, a matter in time past much doubted of, to wit, whether a
bishop or pastor might be translated from one sée to another; &amp; left
<span class="page"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[Page 228]</span>
vndecided, till prescription by roiall authoritie made it good. For
among princes a thing once doone, is well doone, and to be doone
oftentimes, though no warrant be to be found therefore.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Archdecons.</span>
They haue vnder them also their archdeacons, some one, diuerse two, and
manie foure or mo, as their circuits are in quantitie, which archdeacons
are termed in law the bishops eies: and these (beside their ordinarie
courts, which are holden within so manie or more of their seuerall
deanries by themselues or their officials once in a moneth at the least)
doo kéepe yearelie two visitations or synods (as the bishop dooth in
euerie third yeare, wherein he confirmeth some children, though most
care but a little for that ceremonie) in which they make diligent
inquisition and search, as well for the doctrine and behauiour of the
ministers, as the orderlie dealing of the parishioners in resorting to
their parish churches and conformitie vnto religion. They punish also
with great seueritie all such trespassers, either in person or by the
pursse (where permutation of penance is thought more gréeuous to the
offender) as are presented vnto them: or if the cause be of the more
weight, as in cases of heresie, pertinacie, contempt, and such like,
they referre them either to the bishop of the diocesse, or his
chancellor, or else to sundrie graue persons set in authoritie, by
<span class="leftnote">High commissioners.</span>
vertue of an high commission directed vnto them from the prince to that
end, who in verie courteous maner doo sée the offendors gently reformed,
or else seuerlie punished, if necessitie so inforce.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">A prophesie or conference.</span>
Beside this, in manie of our archdeaconries we haue an exercise latelie
begun, which for the most part is called a prophesie or conference, and
erected onelie for the examination or triall of the diligence of the
cleargie in their studie of holie scriptures. Howbeit, such is the
thirstie desire of the people in these daies to heare the word of God,
that they also haue as it were with zealous violence intruded themselues
among them (but as hearers onelie) to come by more knowledge through
their presence at the same. Herein also (for the most part) two of the
yoonger sort of ministers doo expound ech after other some péece of the
scriptures ordinarilie appointed vnto them in their courses (wherein
they orderlie go through with some one of the euangelists, or of the
epistles, as it pleaseth the whole assemblie to choose at the first in
euerie of these conferences) and when they haue spent an houre or a
little more betwéene them, then commeth one of the better learned sort,
who being a graduat for the most part, or knowne to be a preacher
sufficientlie authorised, &amp; of a sound iudgement, supplieth the roome of
a moderator, making first a breefe rehearsall of their discourses, and
then adding what him thinketh good of his owne knowledge, wherby two
houres are thus commonlie spent at this most profitable méeting. When
all is doone, if the first speakers haue shewed anie peece of diligence,
they are commended for their trauell, and incouraged to go forward. If
they haue béene found to be slacke, or not sound in deliuerie of their
doctrine, their negligence and error is openlie reprooued before all
their brethren, who go aside of purpose from the laitie, after the
exercise ended, to iudge of these matters, and consult of the next
speakers and quantitie of the text to be handled in that place. The
laitie neuer speake of course (except some vaine and busie head will now
and then intrude themselues with offense) but are onelie hearers; and as
it is vsed in some places wéekelie, in other once in foureteene daies,
in diuerse monethlie, and elsewhere twise in a yeare, so is it a notable
spurre vnto all the ministers, thereby to applie their bookes, which
otherwise (as in times past) would giue themselues to hawking, hunting,
tables, cards, dice, tipling at the alehouse, shooting of matches, and
other like vanities, nothing commendable in such as should be godlie and
zealous stewards of the good gifts of God, faithfull distributors of his
word vnto the people, and diligent pastors according to their calling.</p>

<p>But alas! as sathan the author of all mischéefe hath in sundrie manners
heretofore hindered the erection and maintenance of manie good things:
so in this he hath stirred vp aduersaries of late vnto this most
profitable exercise, who not regarding the commoditie that riseth
thereby so well to the hearers as spekers; but either stumbling (I
<span class="page"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[Page 229]</span>
cannot tell how) at words and termes, or at the least wise not liking to
here of the reprehension of vice, or peraduenture taking a misliking at
the slender demeanours of such negligent ministers, as now and then in
their courses doo occupie the roomes, haue either by their owne
practise, their sinister information, or suggestions made vpon surmises
vnto other procured the suppression of these conferences, condemning
them as hurtfull, pernicious, and dailie bréeders of no small hurt &amp;
inconuenience. But hereof let God be iudge, vnto whome the cause
belongeth.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Ministers &amp; deacons.</span>
Our elders or ministers and deacons (for subdeacons and the other
inferiour orders, sometime vsed in popish church we haue not) are made
according to a certeine forme of consecration concluded vpon in the time
of king Edward the sixt, by the cleargie of England, and soone after
confirmed by the thrée estates of the realme, in the high court of
parlement. And out of the first sort, that is to saie, of such as are
called to the ministerie (without respect whether they be married or
not) are bishops, deanes, archdeacons, &amp; such as haue the higher places
in the hierarchie of the church elected; and these also as all the rest,
at the first comming vnto anie spirituall promotion, doo yéeld vnto the
prince the entire taxe of that their liuing for one whole yeare, if it
amount in value vnto ten pounds and vpwards, and this vnder the name and
title of first fruits.</p>

<p>With vs also it is permitted, that a sufficient man may (by dispensation
from the prince) hold two liuings, not distant either from other aboue
thirtie miles; whereby it commeth to passe, that as hir maiestie dooth
reape some commoditie by the facultie, so the vnition of two in one man
dooth bring oftentimes more benefit to one of them in a moneth (I meane
for doctrine) than they haue had before peraduenture in manie yeares.</p>

<p>Manie exclame against such faculties, as if there were mo good preachers
that want maintenance, than liuings to mainteine them. In déed when a
liuing is void, there are so manie sutors for it, that a man would
thinke the report to be true and most certeine: but when it commeth to
the triall, who are sufficient, and who not, who are staied men in
conuersation, iudgement, and learning; of that great number you shall
hardlie find one or two, such as they ought to be: and yet none more
earnest to make sure, to promise largelie, beare a better shew, or find
fault with the state of things than they. Neuerthelesse, I doo not
thinke that their exclamations if they were wiselie handled, are
altogither grounded vpon rumours or ambitious minds, if you respect the
state of the thing it selfe, and not the necessitie growing through want
of able men, to furnish out all the cures in England, which both our
vniuersities are neuer able to performe. For if you obserue what numbers
of preachers Cambridge and Oxford doo yearelie send foorth; and how
manie new compositions are made in the court of first fruits, by the
deaths of the last incumbents: you shall soone sée a difference.
Wherefore, if in countrie townes &amp; cities, yea euen in London it selfe,
foure or fiue of the litle churches were brought into one, the
inconuenience would in great part be redressed.</p>

<p>And to saie truth, one most commonlie of these small liuings is of so
little value, that it is not able to mainteine a meane scholar; much
lesse a learned man, as not being aboue ten, twelue, sixteene,
seuentéene, twentie, or thirtie pounds at the most, toward their
charges, which now (more than before time) doo go out of the same. I
saie more than before, bicause euerie small trifle, noble mans request,
or courtesie craued by the bishop, dooth impose and command a twentith
part, a three score part, or two pence in the pound, &amp;c: out of our
liuings, which hitherto hath not béene vsuallie granted, but by consent
of a synod, wherein things were decided according to equitie, and the
poorer sort considered of, which now are equallie burdened.</p>

<p>We paie also the tenths of our liuings to the prince yearelie, according
to such valuation of ech of them, as hath beene latelie made: which
neuerthelesse in time past were not annuall but voluntarie, &amp; paid at
request of king or pope. Herevpon also hangeth a pleasant storie though
doone of late yeares, to wit 1452, at which time the cleargie séeing the
continuall losses that the king of England susteined in France, vpon
some motion of reléefe made, granted in an open conuocation to giue him
two tenths toward the recouerie of Burdeaux, which his grace verie
<span class="page"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[Page 230]</span>
thankefullie receiued. It fortuned also at the same time that Vincentius
Clemens the popes factor was here in England, who hearing what the
clergie had doone, came into the conuocation house also in great hast
and lesse spéed, where, in a solemne oration he earnestlie required them
to be no lesse fauourable to their spirituall father the pope, and
mother the sée of Rome, than they had shewed themselues vnto his vassall
and inferiour, meaning their souereigne lord in temporall iurisdiction,
&amp;c. In deliuering also the cause of his sute, he shewed how gréeuouslie
the pope was disturbed by cutthrotes, varlots, and harlots, which doo
now so abound in Rome, that his holinesse is in dailie danger to be made
awaie amongst them. To be short when this fine tale was told, one of the
companie stood vp and said vnto him; My lord we haue heard your request,
and as we thinke, it deserueth litle consideration and lesse eare, for
how would you haue vs to contribute to his aid in suppression of such,
as he and such as you are doo continuall vphold, it is not vnknowen in
this house what rule is kept in Rome.</p>

<p>I grant (quoth Vincent) that there wanteth iust reformation of manie
things in that citie, which would haue béene made sooner, but now it is
too late: neuerthelesse I beséech you to write vnto his holinesse, with
request that he would leaue and abandon that Babylon, which is but a
sinke of mischiefe, and kéepe his court elsewhere in place of better
fame. And this he shall be the better able also to performe, if by your
liberalitie extended towards him, vnto whome you are most bound, he be
incouraged thereto. Manie other words passed to and fro amongst them,
howbeit in the end Vincent ouercame not, but was dismissed without anie
penie obteined. But to returne to our tenths, a paiement first as
deuised by the pope, and afterward taken vp as by the prescription of
the king, wherevnto we may ioine also our first fruits, which is one
whole yeares commoditie of our liuing, due at our entrance into the
same, the tenths abated vnto the princes cofers, and paid commonlie in
two yeares. For the receipt also of these two paiments, an especiall
office or court is erected, which beareth name of first fruits and
tenths, wherevnto if the partie to be preferred, doo not make his
dutifull repaire by an appointed time after possession taken, there to
compound for the paiment of his said fruits, he incurreth the danger of
a great penaltie, limited by a certeine statute prouided in that
behalfe, against such as doo intrude into the ecclesiasticall function,
and refuse to paie the accustomed duties belonging to the same.</p>

<p>They paie likewise subsidies with the temporaltie, but in such sort,
that if these paie after foure shillings for land, the cleargie
contribute commonlie after six shillings of the pound, so that of a
benefice of twentie pounds by the yeare, the incumbent thinketh himself
well acquited, if all ordinarie paiments being discharged he may reserue
thirtéene pounds six shillings eight pence towards his owne
sustentation, and maintenance of his familie. Seldome also are they
without the compasse of a subsidie, for if they be one yeare cleare from
this paiement, a thing not often seene of late yeares, they are like in
the next to heare of another grant: so that I saie againe they are
seldome without the limit of a subsidie. Herein also they somewhat find
themselues grieued, that the laitie may at euerie taxation helpe
themselues, and so they doo through consideration had of their decaie
and hinderance, and yet their impouerishment cannot but touch also the
parson or vicar, vnto whom such libertie is denied, as is dailie to be
séene in their accompts and tithings.</p>

<p>Some of them also, after the mariages of their children, will haue their
proportions qualified, or by fréendship get themselues quite out of the
booke. But what stand I vpon these things, who haue rather to complaine
of the iniurie offered by some of our neighbors of the laitie, which
dailie endeuor to bring vs also within the compasse of their fifteens or
taxes for their owne ease, whereas the taxe of the whole realme, which
is commonlie greater in the champeigne than woodland soile, amounteth
onelie to 37930 pounds nine pence halfepenie, is a burden easie inough
to be borne vpon so manie shoulders, without the helpe of the cleargie,
whose tenths and subsidies make vp commonlie a double, if not
troublesome vnto their aforesaid paiments. Sometimes also we are
threatned with a Meliùs inquirendum, as if our liuings were not racked
high inough alreadie. But if a man should seeke out where all those
<span class="page"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[Page 231]</span>
church lands were, which in time past did contribute vnto the old summe
required or to be made vp, no doubt no small number of the laitie of all
states should be contributors also with vs, the prince not defrauded of
his expectation and right. We are also charged with armor &amp; munitions
from thirtie pounds vpwards, a thing more néedfull than diuerse other
charges imposed vpon vs are conuenient, by which &amp; other burdens our
case groweth to be more heauie by a great deale (notwithstanding our
immunitie from temporall seruices) than that of the laitie, and for
ought that I sée not likelie to be diminished, as if the church were now
become the asse whereon euerie market man is to ride and cast his
wallet.</p>

<p>The other paiments due vnto the archbishop and bishop at their seuerall
visitations (of which the first is double to the latter) and such also
as the archdeacon receiueth at his synods, &amp;c: remaine still as they did
without anie alteration, onelie this I thinke be added within memorie of
man, that at the comming of euerie prince, his appointed officers doo
commonlie visit the whole realme vnder the forme of an ecclesiasticall
inquisition, in which the clergie doo vsuallie paie double fées, as vnto
the archbishop. Hereby then, and by those alreadie remembred, it is
found that the church of England, is no lesse commodious to the princes
coffers than the state of the laitie, if it doo not farre excéed the
same, since their paiments are certeine, continuall, and seldome abated,
howsoeuer they gather vp their owne duties with grudging, murmuring,
sute, and slanderous speeches of the paiers, or haue their liuings
otherwise hardlie valued vnto the vttermost farding, or shrewdlie
cancelled by the couetousnesse of the patrones, of whome some doo bestow
aduousons of benefices vpon their bakers, butlers, cookes, good archers,
falconers, and horssekéepers, in sted of other recompense, for their
long and faithfull seruice, which they imploie afterward vnto their most
aduantage.</p>

<p>Certes here they resemble the pope verie much, for as he sendeth out his
idols, so doo they their parasites, pages, chamberleins, stewards,
groomes, &amp; lackies; and yet these be the men that first exclame of the
insufficiencie of the ministers, as hoping thereby in due time to get
also their glebes and grounds into their hands. In times past bishopriks
went almost after the same maner vnder the laie princes, and then vnder
the pope, so that he which helped a clerke vnto a see, was sure to haue
a present or purse fine, if not an annuall pension, besides that which
went to the popes coffers, and was thought to be verie good merchandize.
Hereof one example may be touched, as of a thing doone in my yoonger
daies, whilest quéene Marie bare the swaie and gouerned in this land.
After the death of Stephan Gardiner, the sée of Winchester was void for
a season, during which time cardinall Poole made seizure vpon the
reuenues and commodities of the same, pretending authoritie therevnto
Sede vacante, by vertue of his place. With this act of his the bishop of
Lincolne called White tooke such displeasure, that he stepped in like a
mate, with full purpose (as he said) to kéepe that sée from ruine. He
wrote also to Paulus the fourth pope, requiring that he might be
preferred therevnto, promising so as he might be Compos voti, to paie to
the popes coffers 1600 pounds yearlie during his naturall life, and for
one yeere after. But the pope nothing liking of his motion, and yet
desirous to reape a further benefit, first shewed himselfe to stomach
his simonicall practise verie grieuouslie, considering the
dangerousnesse of the time and present estate of the church of England,
which hoong as yet in balance readie to yéeld anie waie, sauing foorth
right, as he alledged in his letters. By which replie he so terrified
the poore bishop, that he was driuen vnto another issue, I meane to
recouer the popes good will, with a further summe than stood with his
ease to part withall. In the end when the pope had gotten this fleece, a
new deuise was found, and meanes made to and by the prince, that White
might be bishop of Winchester, which at the last he obteined, but in
such wise as that the pope and his néerest friends did lose but a little
by it. I could if néed were set downe a report of diuerse other the like
practises, but this shall suffice in stéed of all the rest, least in
reprehending of vice I might shew my selfe to be a teacher of
vngodlinesse, or to scatter more vngratious séed in lewd ground alreadie
choked with wickednesse.</p>

<p>To proceed therefore with the rest, I thinke it good also to remember,
that the names vsuallie giuen vnto such as féed the flocke remaine in
like sort as in times past, so that these words, parson, vicar, curat,
<span class="page"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[Page 232]</span>
and such are not yet abolished more than the canon law it selfe, which
is dailie pleaded, as I haue said elsewhere; although the statutes of
the realme haue greatlie infringed the large scope, and brought the
exercise of the same into some narrower limits. There is nothing read in
our churches but the canonicall scriptures, whereby it commeth to passe
that the psalter is said ouer once in thirtie daies, the new testament
foure times, and the old testament once in the yeare. And herevnto if
the curat be adiudged by the bishop or his deputies, sufficientlie
instructed in the holie scriptures, and therewithall able to teach, he
permitteth him to make some exposition or exhortation in his parish,
vnto amendment of life. And for so much as our churches and vniuersities
haue béene so spoiled in time of errour, as there cannot yet be had such
number of able pastours as may suffice for euerie parish to haue one:
there are (beside foure sermons appointed by publike order in the yeare)
certeine sermons or homilies (deuised by sundrie learned men, confirmed
for sound doctrine by consent of the diuines, and publike authoritie of
the prince) and those appointed to be read by the curats of meane
vnderstanding (which homilies doo comprehend the principall parts of
christian doctrine, as of originall sinne, of iustification by faith, of
charitie, and such like) vpon the sabbaoth daies, vnto the congregation.
And after a certeine number of psalmes read, which are limited according
to the daies of the month, for morning and euening praier, we haue two
lessons, wherof the first is taken out of the old testament, the second
out of the new, and of these latter that in the morning is out of the
gospels, the other in the after noone out of some one of the epistles.
After morning praier also we haue the letanie and suffrages, an
inuocation in mine opinion not deuised without the great assistance of
the spirit of God, although manie curious mindsicke persons vtterlie
condemne it as superstitious and sauoring of coniuration and sorcerie.</p>

<p>This being doone, we procéed vnto the communion, if anie communicants be
to receiue the eucharist, if not we read the decalog, epistle and
gospell with the Nicene créed (of some in derision called the drie
communion) and then procéed vnto an homilie or sermon, which hath a
psalme before and after it, and finallie vnto the baptisme of such
infants as on euerie sabaoth daie (if occasion so require) are brought
vnto the churches: and thus is the forenoone bestowed. In the after
noone likewise we méet againe, and after the psalmes and lessons ended
we haue commonlie a sermon, or at the leastwise our youth catechised by
the space of an houre. And thus doo we spend the sabaoth daie in good
and godlie exercises, all doone in our vulgar toong, that each one
present may heare and vnderstand the same, which also in cathedrall and
collegiat churches is so ordered, that the psalmes onelie are soong by
note, the rest being read (as in common parish churches) by the minister
with a lowd voice, sauing that in the administration of the communion
the quier singeth the answers, the créed, and sundrie other things
appointed, but in so plaine, I saie, and distinct maner, that each one
present may vnderstand what they sing, euerie word hauing but one note,
though the whole harmonie consist of manie parts, and those verie
cunninglie set by the skilfull in that science.</p>

<p>Certes this translation of the seruice of the church into the vulgar
toong, hath not a litle offended the pope almost in euerie age, as a
thing verie often attempted by diuers princes, but neuer generallie
obteined, for feare least the consenting thervnto might bréed the
ouerthrow (as it would in déed) of all his religion and hierarchie:
neuerthelesse in some places where the kings and princes dwelled not
vnder his nose, it was performed maugre his resistance. Vratislaus duke
of Bohemia, would long since haue doone the like also in his kingdome,
but not daring to venter so farre without the consent of the pope, he
wrote vnto him thereof, and receiued his answer inhibitorie vnto all his
proceeding in the same.</p>

<p>"Gregorius septimus Vratislao Bohemorum duci, &amp;c. Quia nobilitas tua
postulat, quòd secund&#363; Sclauonic&#257; lingu&#257; apud vos diuinum

<p>I would set downe two or thrée more of the like instruments passed from
that see vnto the like end, but this shall suffice, being lesse common
than the other, which are to be had more plentifullie.</p>

<p>As for our churches themselues, belles, and times of morning and euening
praier, remaine as in times past, sauing that all images, shrines,
tabernacles, roodlofts, and monuments of idolatrie are remooued, taken
downe, and defaced; onelie the stories in glasse windowes excepted,
which for want of sufficient store of new stuffe, and by reason of
extreame charge that should grow by the alteration of the same into
white panes throughout the realme, are not altogither abolished in most
places at once, but by little and little suffered to decaie, that white
glasse may be prouided and set vp in their roomes. Finallie, whereas
there was woont to be a great partition betwéene the quire and the bodie
of the church; now it is either verie small or none at all: and to saie
the truth altogither needlesse, sith the minister saith his seruice
commonlie in the bodie of the church, with his face toward the people,
in a little tabernacle of wainscot prouided for the purpose: by which
means the ignorant doo not onelie learne diuerse of the psalmes and
vsuall praiers by heart, but also such as can read, doo praie togither
with him: so that the whole congregation at one instant powre out their
petitions vnto the liuing God, for the whole estate of his church in
most earnest and feruent manner. Our holie and festiuall daies are verie
well reduced also vnto a lesse number; for whereas (not long since) we
had vnder the pope foure score and fiftéene, called festiuall, and
thirtie Profesti, beside the sundaies, they are all brought vnto seauen
and twentie: and with them the superfluous numbers of idle waks, guilds,
fraternities, church-ales, helpe-ales, and soule-ales, called also
dirge-ales, with the heathnish rioting at bride-ales, are well
diminished and laid aside. And no great matter were it if the feasts of
all our apostles, euangelists, and martyrs, with that of all saincts,
were brought to the holie daies that follow vpon Christmasse, Easter,
and Whitsuntide; and those of the virgine Marie, with the rest vtterlie
remooued from the calendars, as neither necessarie nor commendable in a
reformed church.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Apparell.</span>
The apparell in like sort of our clergie men is comlie, &amp; in truth, more
decent than euer it was in the popish church: before the vniuersities
bound their graduats vnto a stable attire, afterward vsurped also euen
by the blind sir Johns. For if you peruse well my chronologie insuing,
you shall find, that they went either in diuerse colors like plaiers, or
in garments of light hew, as yellow, red, greene, &amp;c: with their shooes
piked, their haire crisped, their girdles armed with siluer; their
shooes, spurres, bridles, &amp;c: buckled with like mettall: their apparell
(for the most part) of silke, and richlie furred; their cappes laced and
butned with gold: so that to méet a priest in those daies, was to behold
a peacocke that spreadeth his taile when he danseth before the henne:
which now (I saie) is well reformed. Touching
<span class="leftnote">Hospitalitie.</span>
hospitalitie, there was neuer anie greater vsed in England, sith by
reason that mariage is permitted to him that will choose that kind of
life, their meat and drinke is more orderlie and frugallie dressed;
their furniture of houshold more conuenient, and better looked vnto; and
the poore oftener fed generallie than heretofore they haue béene, when
onlie a few bishops, and double or treble beneficed men did make good
cheere at Christmasse onelie, or otherwise kept great houses for the
interteinment of the rich, which did often see and visit them. It is
thought much peraduenture, that some bishops, &amp;c: in our time doo come
short of the ancient gluttonie and prodigalitie of their predecessors:
but to such as doo consider of the curtailing of their liuings, or
excessiue prices whervnto things are growen, and how their course is
limited by law, and estate looked into on euery side, the cause of their
so dooing is well inough perceiued. This also offendeth manie, that they
<span class="page"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[Page 234]</span>
should after their deaths leaue their substances to their wiues and
children: wheras they consider not, that in old time such as had no
lemans nor bastards (verie few were there God wot of this sort) did
leaue their goods and possessions to their brethren and kinsfolks,
whereby (as I can shew by good record) manie houses of gentilitie haue
growen and béene erected. If in anie age some one of them did found a
college, almeshouse, or schoole, if you looke vnto these our times, you
shall see no fewer déeds of charitie doone, nor better grounded vpon the
<span class="leftnote">Mariage.</span>
right stub of pietie than before. If you saie that their wiues be fond,
after the deceasse of their husbands, and bestow themselues not so
aduisedlie as their calling requireth, which God knoweth these curious
surueiors make small accompt of in truth, further than thereby to gather
matter of reprehension: I beséech you then to looke into all states of
the laitie, &amp; tell me whether some duchesses, countesses, barons, or
knights wiues, doo not fullie so often offend in the like as they: for
Eue will be Eue though Adam would saie naie. Not a few also find fault
<span class="leftnote">Thred-bare gownes from whence they come.</span>
with our thred-bare gowns, as if not our patrones but our wiues were
causes of our wo. But if it were knowne to all, that I know to haue
beene performed of late in Essex, where a minister taking a benefice (of
lesse than twentie pounds in the Quéenes bookes so farre as I remember)
was inforced to paie to his patrone, twentie quarters of otes, ten
quarters of wheat, and sixtéene yéerelie of barleie, which he called
hawkes meat; and another left the like in farme to his patrone for ten
pounds by the yéere, which is well woorth fortie at the least, the cause
of our thred-bare gownes would easilie appeere, for such patrons doo
scrape the wooll from our clokes. Wherfore I may well saie, that such a
thred-bare minister is either an ill man, or hath an ill patrone, or
both: and when such cookes &amp; cobling shifters shall be remooued and
weeded out of the ministerie, I doubt not but our patrons will prooue
better men, and be reformed whether they will or not, or else the single
minded bishops shall sée the liuing bestowed vpon such as doo deserue
it. When the Pragmatike sanction tooke place first in France, it was
supposed that these enormities should vtterlie haue ceased: but when the
elections of bishops came once into the hands of the canons and
spirituall men, it grew to be farre worse. For they also within a while
waxing couetous, by their owne experience learned aforehand, raised the
markets, and sought after new gaines by the gifts of the greatest
liuings in that countrie, wherein (as Machiauell writeth)
<span class="leftnote">Number of churches in France.</span>
 are eightéene archbishoprikes, one hundred fortie and
sixe bishoprikes, 740 abbies, eleuen vniuersities, 1000700
stéeples (if his report be sound.) Some are of the opinion, that if
sufficient men in euerie towne might be sent for from the vniuersities,
this mischiefe would soone be remedied; but I am cleane of another mind.
For when I consider wherevnto the gifts of felowships in some places are
growen: the profit that ariseth at sundrie elections of scholars out of
<span class="leftnote">Pretie packing.</span>
grammar schooles, to the posers, schoolemasters, and preferrers of them
to our vniuersities, the gifts of a great number of almeshouses builded
for the maimed and impotent souldiors, by princes and good men
heretofore mooued with a pittifull consideration of the poore
distressed: how rewards, pensions, and annuities also doo reigne in
other cases, wherby the giuer is brought somtimes into extreame miserie,
&amp; that not so much as the roome of a common souldior is not obteined
oftentimes, without a What will you giue me? I am brought into such a
mistrust of the sequele of this deuise, that I dare pronounce (almost
for certeine) that if Homer were now aliue, it should be said to him:</p>

<p class="ind1">"Túque licèt venias musis comitatus Homere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Si nihil attuleris ibis Homere foras."</p>

<p>More I could saie, and more I would saie of these and other things, were
it not that in mine owne iudgement I haue said inough alreadie for the
aduertisement of such as be wise. Neuerthelesse, before I finish this
chapter, I will adde a word or two (so brieflie as I can) of the old
estate of cathedrall churches, which I haue collected togither here and
there among the writers, and whereby it shall easilie be seene what they
were, and how neere the gouernment of ours doo in these daies approch
vnto them, for that there is an irreconciliable ods betwéene them and
<span class="page"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[Page 235]</span>
those of the papists, I hope there is no learned man indéed, but will
acknowlege and yéeld vnto it.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Old estate of cathedrall churches.</span>
We find therefore in the time of the primitiue church, that there was in
euerie see or iurisdiction one schoole at the least, whereinto such as
were catechistes in christian religion did resort. And hereof as we may
find great testimonie for Alexandria, Antioch, Rome, and Hierusalem; so
no small notice is left of the like in the inferior sort, if the names
of such as taught in them be called to mind, &amp; the histories well read
which make report of the same. These schooles were vnder the
iurisdiction of the bishops, and from thence did they &amp; the rest of the
elders choose out such as were the ripest scholars, and willing to serue
in the ministerie, whome they placed also in their cathedrall churches,
there not onelie to be further instructed in the knowledge of the word,
but also to invre them to the deliuerie of the same vnto the people in
sound maner, to minister the sacraments, to visit the sicke and brethren
imprisoned, and to performe such other duties as then belonged to their
charges. The bishop himselfe and elders of the church were also hearers
and examiners of their doctrine, and being in processe of time found
meet workmen for the lords haruest, they were forthwith sent abrode
(after imposition of hands, and praier generallie made for their good
proceeding) to some place or other then destitute of hir pastor, and
other taken from the schoole also placed in their roomes. What number of
such clerks belonged now and then to some one sée, the chronologie
following shall easilie declare: and in like sort what officers,
widowes, and other persons were dailie mainteined in those seasons by
the offerings and oblations of the faithfull, it is incredible to be
reported, if we compare the same with the decaies and ablations séene
and practised at this present. But what is that in all the world which
auarice and negligence will not corrupt and impaire? And as this is a
paterne of the estate of the cathedrall churches in those times, so I
wish that the like order of gouernment might once againe be restored
vnto the same, which may be doone with ease, sith the schooles are
alreadie builded in euerie diocesse, the vniuersities, places of their
preferment vnto further knowledge, and the cathedrall churches great
inough to receiue so manie as shall come from thence to be instructed
vnto doctrine. But one hinderance of this is alreadie and more &amp; more to
be looked for (beside the plucking and snatching commonlie séene from
such houses and the church) and that is, the generall contempt of the
ministerie, and small consideration of their former paines taken,
whereby lesse and lesse hope of competent maintenance by preaching the
word is likelie to insue. Wherefore the greatest part of the more
excellent wits choose rather to imploy their studies vnto physike and
the lawes, vtterlie giuing ouer the studie of the scriptures, for feare
least they should in time not get their bread by the same. By this
meanes also the stalles in their quéeres would be better filled, which
now (for the most part) are emptie, and prebends should be prebends
indéed, there to liue till they were preferred to some ecclesiasticall
function, and then other men chosen to succéed them in their roomes,
whereas now prebends are but superfluous additaments vnto former
excesses, &amp; perpetuall commodities vnto the owners, which before time
were but temporall (as I haue said before.) But as I haue good leisure
to wish for these things: so it shall be a longer time before it will be
brought to passe. Neuerthelesse, as I will praie for a reformation in
this behalfe, so will I here conclude this my discourse of the estate of
our churches, and go in hand with the limits and bounds of our seuerall
sées, in such order as they shall come vnto my present remembrance.</p>

<small>OF THE NUMBER OF BISHOPRIKES AND THEIR SEUERALL CIRCUITS.</small><br />

CHAP. II.</h3>

<p>Hauing alreadie spoken generally of the state of our church, now will I
touch the sées seuerallie, saieng so much of ech of them as shall be
conuenient for the time, and not onelie out of the ancient, but also the
later writers, and somewhat of mine owne experience, beginning first
with the sée of Canturburie, as the most notable, whose archbishop is
the primat of all this land for ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, and most
accompted of commonlie, bicause he is néerer to the prince, and readie
at euerie call.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Canturburie.</span>
The iurisdiction of Canturburie therefore, erected first by Augustine
the moonke, in the time of Ethelbert king of Kent, if you haue respect
to hir prouinciall regiment, extendeth it selfe ouer all the south and
west parts of this Iland, and Ireland, as I haue noted in the chapter
precedent, and few shires there are wherein the archbishop hath not some
peculiars. But if you regard the same onelie that was and is proper vnto
his see, from the beginning, it reacheth but ouer one parcell of Kent,
which Rudburne calleth Cantwarland, the iurisdiction of Rochester
including the rest: so that in this one countie the greatest
archbishoprike and the least bishoprike of all are linked in togither.
That of Canturburie hath vnder it one archdeaconrie, who hath
iurisdiction ouer eleauen deanries or a hundred sixtie one parish
churches; &amp; in the popish time in sted of the 3093 pounds, eighteene
shillings, halfepenie, farthing, which it now paieth vnto hir maiestie,
vnder the name of first frutes, there went out of this see to Rome, at
euerie alienation 10000 ducates or florens, beside 5000 that the new
elect did vsuallie paie for his pall, each ducat being then worth an
English crowne or thereabout, as I haue béene informed.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Rochester.</span>
The sée of Rochester is also included within the limits of Kent, being
erected by Augustine in the 604 of Grace, and reigne of Ceolrijc ouer
the west-Saxons. The bishop of this sée hath one archdeacon, vnder whose
gouernment in causes ecclesiasticall are thrée deanries, or 132 parish
churches: so that hereby it is to be gathered, that there are 393 parish
churches in Kent, ouer which the said two archdeacons haue especiall
cure &amp; charge. He was woont to paie also vnto the court of Rome at his
admission to that see 1300 ducats or florens, as I read, which was an
hard valuation, considering the smalnesse of circuit belonging to his
sée. Howbeit, in my time it is so farre from ease by diminution, that it
is raised to 1432 crownes, &amp;c: or as we resolue them into our pounds,
358 pounds, thrée shillings, six pence, halfepennie, farthing, a
reckoning a great deale more preciselie made than anie bishop of that
sée dooth take any great delight in. He was crosse-bearer in times past
vnto the archbishop of Canturburie. And there are and haue béene few
sées in England, which at one time or other haue not fetched their
bishops for the most part from this see: for as it is of it selfe but a
small thing in déed, so it is commonlie a preparatiue to an higher
place. But of all that euer possessed it, Thomas Kempe had the best
lucke, who being but a poore mans sonne of Wie (vnto which towne he was
a great benefactor) grew first to be doctor of both lawes, then of
diuinitie; and afterward being promoted to this sée, he was translated
from thence to Chichester, thirdlie to London, next of all to Yorke, and
finallie after seauen and twentie yeares to Canturburie, where he became
also cardinall, deacon, and then preest in the court of Rome, according
to this verse, "Bis primas, ter præses, bis cardine functus." Certes I
note this man, bicause he bare some fauour to the furtherance of the
gospell, and to that end he either builded or repared the pulpit in
Paules churchyard, and tooke order for the continuall maintenance of a
sermon there vpon the sabaoth, which dooth continue vnto my time, as a
place from whence the soundest doctrine is alwaies to be looked for, and
for such strangers to resort vnto as haue no habitation in anie parish
within the citie where it standeth.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">London.</span>
The sée of London was erected at the first by Lucius, who made it of an
<span class="page"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[Page 237]</span>
archeflamine and temple of Iupiter an archbishops sée, and temple vnto
the liuing God, and so it continued, vntill Augustine translated the
title thereof to Canturburie. The names of the archbishops of London are
these; Theon, Eluan, Cadoc, Owen, Conan, Palladius, Stephan, Iltutus
restitutus, anno 350, Theodromus, Theodredus, Hilarius, Fastidius, anno
420, Guittelinus, Vodinus slaine by the Saxons, and Theonus Iunior. But
for their iust order of succession as yet I am not resolued,
neuerthelesse the first bishop there was ordeined by Augustine the
moonke, in the yeare of Christ 604, in the time of Ceolrijc, after he
had remooued his see further off into Kent: I wote not vpon what secret
occasion, if not the spéedie hearing of newes from Rome, and readinesse
to flee out of the land, if any trouble should betide him. For
iurisdiction it included Essex, Middlesex, and part of Herefordshire,
which is neither more nor lesse in quantitie than the ancient kingdome
of the east Angles, before it was vnited to the west Saxons. The
cathedrall church belonging to this sée, was first begun by Ethelbert of
Kent, Indic. 1. 598 of Inuber as I find, whilest he held that part of
the said kingdome vnder his gouernement. Afterward when the Danes had
sundrie times defaced it, it was repared and made vp with hard stone,
but in the end it was taken downe, and wholie reedified by Mawrice
bishop of that sée, and sometimes chapleine to the bastard Henrie the
first, allowing him stone and stuffe from Bainards castell néere vnto
Ludgate, then ruinous for the furtherance of his works. Howbeit the
moold of the quire was not statelie inough in the eies of some of his
successors; wherefore in the yeare of Grace 1256, it was taken downe and
brought into another forme, and called the new worke, at which time also
the bodies of diuerse kings and bishops were taken vp and bestowed in
the walles, to the end their memories should be of longer continuance.
The iurisdiction of this sée also vnder the bishop, is committed to
foure archdeacons, to wit, of London, Essex, Middlesex, and Colchester,
who haue amongst them to the number of 363 parish churches, or
thereabouts, beside the peculiars belonging to the archbishop and
chapiter of that house, and at euerie alienation the bishop paieth for
his owne part 1119 pounds, eight shillings and foure pence (but in old
time 3000 florens) which diuerse suppose to be more, than (as it now
standeth) the bishop is able to make of it. Of the archdeconrie, of S.
Albons added therevnto by king Henrie the eight (whereby the bishop hath
fiue eies) I speake not, for although it be vnder the bishop of London
for visitations and synods, yet is it otherwise reputed as member of the
sée of Lincolne, and therefore worthilie called an exempt, it hath also
fiue and twentie parishes, of which foure are in Buckingham, the rest in
Herefordshire.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Chichester.</span>
The first beginning of the sée of Chichester was in the Ile of Seales or
Seolseie, and from thence translated to Chichester, in the time of
William the bastard, and generall remoouing of sées from small villages
vnto the greater townes. It conteineth Sussex onelie vnder hir
iurisdiction, wherein are sixtéene deanries, and 551 parish churches, it
paid at euerie alienation to the sée of Rome 333 ducats: and after
Edbert the first bishop, one Cella succeeded, after whome the
pontificall chaire (not then worth 677 pounds by the yéere as now it is)
was void by many yeares. It was erected in Seoleseie also 711, by the
decrée of a synod holden in Sussex, which borowed it from the
iurisdiction of Winchester, whereof before it was reputed a parcell. Of
all the bishops that haue béene in this sée, Thomas Kempe alwaies
excepted, I read not of anie one that hath béene of more estimation than
William Read, sometime fellow of Merteine college in Oxford, doctor of
diuinitie, and the most profound astronomer that liued in his time, as
appeareth by his collection which sometime I did possesse; his image is
yet in the librarie there, and manie instruments of astronomie reserued
in that house (a college erected sometime by Walter Merton bishop of
Rochester, and lord chancellor of England) he builded also the castell
of Amberleie from the verie foundation, as Edward Scorie or Storie his
successor did the new crosse in the market place of Chichester.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Winchester.</span>
The bishop of Winchester was sometime called bishop of the west Saxons,
and of Dorchester, which towne was giuen to Birinus and his successors,
by Kinigils and Oswald of the Northumbers, in whose time it was erected
by Birinus and his fellowes. In my time it hath iurisdiction onelie ouer
Hamshire, Surrie, Iardeseie, Gardeseie, and the Wight, conteining eight
<span class="page"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[Page 238]</span>
deaneries, two hundred seuentie and six parish churches, and beside all
this he is perpetuall prelate to the honorable order of the Garter,
deuised by Edward the third: he paid in old time to Rome 12000 ducates
or florens, but now his first fruits are 2491 pounds nine shillings
eight pence halfe penie. Canturburie was said to be the higher racke,
but Winchester hath borne the name to be the better mangier. There are
also which make Lucius to be the first founder of an house of praier in
Winchester, as Kinigils did build the second, and Kinwaldus his sonne
the third; but you shall sée the truth herof in the chronologie insuing.
And herevnto if the old catalog of the bishops of this sée be well
considered of, and the acts of the greatest part of them indifferentlie
weighed, as they are to be read in our histories, you shall find the
most egregious hypocrites, the stoutest warriours, the cruellest
tyrants, the richest monimoongers, and politike counsellors in temporall
affaires to haue, I wote not by what secret working of the diuine
prouidence, beene placed here in Winchester, since the foundation of
that sée, which was erected by Birinus 639 (whome pope Honorius sent
hither out of Italie) and first planted at Dorchester, in the time of
Kinigils, then translated to Winchester, where it dooth yet continue.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Salisburie.</span>
Salisburie was made the chéefe sée of Shirburne by bishop Harman
(predecessor to Osmond) who brought it from Shirburne to that citie; it
hath now Barkeshire, Wilshire, and Dorsetshire vnder hir iurisdiction.
For after the death of Hedda, which was 704, Winchester was diuided in
two, so that onelie Hamshire and Surrie were left vnto it, and Wilton,
Dorset, Barkeshire, Summerset, Deuon &amp; Cornewill assigned vnto Shirburne
till other order was taken. Bishop Adeline did first sit in that
bishoprike (704 as I said) and placed his chaire at Shirburne vpon the
said diuision. And as manie lerned bishops did succéed him in that
roome, before and after it was remooued to Sarum; so there was neuer a
more noble ornament to that sée than bishop Iuell, of whose great
learning and iudgement the world it selfe beareth witnesse,
notwithstanding that the papists prefer S. Osmond (as they call him)
because he builded the minster there, and made the portesse called
Ordinale ecclesiastici officij, which old préests were woont to vse. The
bishops also of this sée were sometimes called bishops of Sunning, of
their old mansion house neere vnto Reading (as it should seeme) and
among those that liued before the said Iuell, one Roger builded the
castell of the Vies in the time of Henrie the first, taken in those
daies for the strongest hold in England, as vnto whose gate there were
regals and gripes for six or seuen port cullises. Finallie this sée paid
vnto Rome 4000 florens, but vnto hir maiestie in my time 1367 pounds
twelue shillings eight pence, as I did find of late.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Excester.</span>
Excester hath, Deuonshire and Cornewall, sometime two seuerall
bishopriks, but in the end brought into one of Cornewall, and from
thence to Excester in the time of the Bastard or soone after. It began
vpon this occasion, Anno Gratiæ 905, in a prouinciall councell holden by
the elder Edward &amp; Plegimond archbishop of Canturburie, among the
Gewises, wherein it was found, that the see of Winchester had not onelie
béene without hir pastor by the space of seuen yéeres, but also that hir
iurisdiction was farre greater than two men were able well to gouerne;
therefore from the former two, to wit, Winchester and Shirburne, three
other were taken, whereby that see was now diuided into fiue parts; the
latter thrée being Welles, Kirton, and Cornwall: this of Cornwall hauing
hir sée then at saint Patroks, not farre from north-Wales vpon the riuer
Helmouth: he of Deuon holding his iurisdiction in Deuonshire, Kirton, or
Cridioc. And the bishop of Welles being allowed Dorset and Barkshires
for his part, to gouerne and looke vnto according to his charge.
Finallie, these two of Deuon and Cornwall being vnited, the valuation
thereof was taxed by the sée of Rome at six thousand ducats or florens,
which were trulie paid at euerie alienation; but verie hardlie (as I
gesse) sith that in my time, wherein all things are racked to the verie
vttermost, I find that it is litle worth aboue fiue hundred pounds by
the yéere, bicause hir tenths are but fiftie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bath.</span>
Bath, whose see was sometime at Welles, before Iohn the bishop there
annexed the church of Bath vnto it, which was 1094, hath Summersetshire
onlie, and the valuation thereof in the court of Rome was foure hundred
&amp; thirtie florens: but in hir maiesties books I find it fiue hundred
<span class="page"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[Page 239]</span>
thirtie and three pounds, and about one od shilling: which declareth a
precise examination of the estate of that sée. Of the erection of this
bishoprike, mentioned in the discourse of Excester, I find the former
assertion confirmed by another author, and in somewhat more large maner,
which I will also remember, onelie because it pleaseth me somewhat
better than the words before alleged out of the former writer. This
bishoprike (saith he) was erected 905, in a councell holden among the
Gewises, whereat king Edward of the west-Saxons, and Plegimond
archbishop of Canturburie were present. For that part of the countrie
had béene seuen yéeres without anie pastorall cure. And therfore in this
councell it was agréed, that for the two bishoprikes (whereof one was at
<span class="leftnote">The bishoprike of Shirburne diuided into thrée.</span>
Winchester, another at Shireburne) there should be fiue ordeined,
whereby the people there might be the better instructed. By this meanes
Frithstan was placed at Winchester, and Ethelme at Shireburne, both of
them being then void. Shireburne also susteined the subdiuision; so that
Werstane was made bishop of Cridioc or Deuonshire (whose sée was at
Kirton), Herstan of Cornwall, and Eadulfe of Welles, vnto whome Barkshire
and Dorsetshire were appointed. But now you sée what alteration is made,
by consideration of the limits of their present iurisdictions.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Worcester.</span>
Worcester sometime called Episcopatus Wicciorum (that is, the bishoprike
of the Wiccies or Huiccies) hath Worcester, &amp; part of Warwikeshires. And
before the bishoprike of Glocester was taken out of the same, it paid to
the pope two thousand ducats of gold at euerie change of prelat: but now
the valuation thereof is one thousand fortie nine pounds, seauen pence
halfe penie farthing (except my remembrance doo deceiue me.) This sée
was begunne either in, or not long before the time of Offa king of the
east-Angles, and Boselus was the first bishop there; after whome
succéeded Ostfort, then Egwine who went in pilgrimage to Rome, with
Kinredus of Mercia and the said Offa, and there gat a monasterie (which
he builded in Worcester) confirmed by Constantine the pope. In this sée
was one of your lordships ancestors sometime bishop, whose name was
Cobham, and doctor both of diuinitie and of the canon law, who, during
the time of his pontificalitie there, builded the vault of the north
side of the bodie of the church, and there lieth buried in the same (as
I haue béene informed.) Certes this man was once elected, and should
haue béene archbishop of Canturburie in the roome of Reginald that died
1313 vnder Edward the second: but the pope frustrated his election,
fearing least he would haue shewed himselfe more affectionate towards
his prince than to his court of Rome; wherefore he gaue Canturburie to
the bishop of Worcester then being. And furthermore, least he should
seeme altogither to reiect the said Thomas and displease the king, he
gaue him in the end the bishoprike of Worcester, whereinto he entred
1317, Martij 31, being thursdaie (as appeereth by the register of that
house) after long plée holden for the aforesaid sée of Canturburie in
the court of Rome, wherein most monie did oftenest preuaile. This is
also notable of that sée, that fiue Italians succéeded ech other in the
same, by the popes prouision; as Egidius, Syluester, Egidius his nephue
(for nephues might say in those daies; Father shall I call you vncle?
And vncles also; Son I must call thée nephue) Iulius de Medices,
afterward pope Clement, and Hieronymus de Nugutijs, men verie likelie,
no doubt, to benefit the common people by their doctrine. Some of these
being at the first but poore men in Rome, and yet able by selling all
they had to make a round summe against a rainie daie, came first into
fauor with the pope, then into familiaritie, finallie into orders; and
from thence into the best liuings of the church, farre off where their
parentage could not easilie be heard of, nor made knowne vnto their
neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Glocester.</span>
Glocester hath Glocestershire onelie, wherein are nine deanries, and to
the number of 294 parish churches, as I find by good record. But it
neuer paid anie thing to Rome, bicause it was erected by king Henrie the
eight, after he had abolished the vsurped authoritie of the pope, except
in quéene Maries, if anie such thing were demanded, as I doubt not but
it was: yet is it woorth yeerelie 315 pounds, seauen shillings thrée
pence, as the booke of first fruits declareth.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Hereford.</span>
Hereford hath Herefordshire and part of Shropshire, and it paid to Rome
<span class="page"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[Page 240]</span>
at euerie alienation 1800 ducats at the least, but in my time it paieth
vnto hir maiesties cofers 768 pounds, ten shillings, ten pence, halfe
penie, farthing. In this sée there was a bishop sometime called Iohn
Bruton, vpon whome the king then reigning, by likelihood for want of
competent maintenance, bestowed the keeping of his wardrobe, which he
held long time with great honour, as his register saith. A woonderfull
preferment that bishops should be preferred from the pulpit, to the
custodie of wardrobes: but such was the time. Neuerthelesse his
honorable custodie of that charge is more solemnlie remembred, than anie
good sermon that euer he made, which function peraduenture he committed
to his suffragane, sith bishops in those daies had so much businesse in
the court, that they could not attend to doctrine and exhortation.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Lichfield.</span>
Lichefield, wherevnto Couentrie was added, in the time of Henrie the
first, at the earnest sute of Robert bishop of that see, hath
Staffordshire, Darbishire, part of Shropshire, and the rest of
Warwikeshire, that is void of subiection to the sée of Worcestershire.
It was erected in the time of Peada king of the south Mercians, which
laie on this side the Trent, and therein one Dinas was installed, about
the yeare of Grace 656, after whom Kellac first, then Tunher an
Englishman succéeded, this later being well learned, and consecrated by
the Scots. In the time of the bastard, I wot not vpon what occasion, one
Peter bishop of this sée translated his chaire to Chester, and there
held it for a season, whereby it came to passe that the bishops of
Lichfield were for a while called bishops of Chester. But Robert his
successor not likeing of this president, remooued his chaire from
Chester to Couentrie, and there held it whilest he liued, whereby the
originall diuision of the bishoprike of Lichfield into Lichefield,
Chester, and Couentrie, dooth easilie appeare, although in my time
Lichfield and Couentrie be vnited, and Chester remaineth a bishoprike by
it selfe. It paid the pope at euerie alienation 1733 florens, or (as
some old bookes haue) 3000, a good round summe, but not without a iust
punishment, as one saith, sith that anno 765, Edulfe bishop there vnder
Offa king of Mercia, would by his helpe haue bereaued the archbishop of
Canturburie of his pall, &amp; so did in déed vnder pope Hadrian, holding
the same vntill things were reduced vnto their ancient forme. Before the
time also of bishop Langton, the prebends of this see laie here and
there abroad in the citie, where the vicars also had an house, of which
this honest bishop misliked not a little for sundrie causes; wherefore
he began their close, and bestowed so much in building the same, and
pauing the stréets, that his hungrie kinsmen did not a little grudge at
his expenses, thinking that his emptie cofers would neuer make them
gentlemen, for which preferment the freends of most bishops gaped
earnestlie in those daies. King Iohn was the greatest benefactor vnto
this sée, next vnto Offa; and it is called Lichfield, Quasi mortuorum
campus, bicause of the great slaughter of christians made there (as some
write) vnder Dioclesian. Howbeit in my time the valuation thereof is 703
pounds, fiue shillings two pence, halfepenie, farthing, a summe verie
narrowlie cast by that auditor which tooke it first in hand.</p>

<p>Oxford hath Oxfordshire onelie, a verie yoong iurisdiction, erected by
king Henrie the eight, &amp; where in the time of quéene Marie, one Goldwell
was bishop, who (as I remember) was a Iesuit, dwelling in Rome, and more
conuersant (as the constant fame went) in the blacke art, than skilfull
in the scriptures, and yet he was of great countenance amongst the
Romane monarchs. It is said that obseruing the canons of his order, he
regarded not the temporalities of that sée: but I haue heard since that
he wist well inough what became of those commodities, for by one meane
and other he found the swéetnesse of 354 pounds sixteene shillings thrée
pence halfe penie, yearelie growing to him, which was euen inough (if
not too much) for the maintenance of a frier toward the drawing out of
circles, characters, &amp; lineaments of imagerie, wherein he was passing
skilfull, as the fame then went in Rome, and not vnheard of in Oxford.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Elie.</span>
Elie hath Cambridgshire, and the Ile of Elie. It was erected 1109 by
Henrie the first, being before a rich and wealthie abbeie. One Heruie
also was made bishop there, as I haue found in a register, belonging
sometime to that house being translated from Bangor. Finallie it paid to
the pope at euerie alienation 7000 ducats, as the registers there do
<span class="page"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[Page 241]</span>
testifie at large. Albeit that in my time I find a note of 2134 pounds
sixtéene shillings thrée pence halfe penie farthing, whose disme ioined
to those of all the bishopriks in England, doo yéeld yearelie to hir
maiesties coffers 23370 pounds sixtéene shillings thrée pence halfe
penie farthing: whereby also the huge sums of monie going out of this
land to the court of Rome dooth in some measure appéere. Ethelwold
afterward bishop of Winchester builded the first monasterie of Elie vpon
the ruines of a nunrie then in the kings hands, howbeit the same house,
whereof he himselfe was abbat, was yer long destroied by enimies, and he
in lieu of his old preferment rewarded by king Edgar, with the aforesaid
bishoprike, from whence with more than lionlike boldnesse he expelled
the secular préests, and stored with moonkes prouided from Abandune
néere Oxford, by the helpe of Edgar and Dunstane then metropolitane of
England. There was sometime a greeuous contention betwéene Thomas Lild
bishop of this see, and the king of England, about the yeare of Grace
1355, which I will here deliuer out of an old record, because the matter
is so parciallie penned by some of the brethren of that house, in fauour
of the bishop; &amp; for that I was also abused with the same in the
entrance thereof at the first into my chronologie. The blacke prince
fauoring one Robert Stretton his chapleine, a man vnlearned and not
worthie the name of a clearke, the matter went on so farre, that what
for loue, and somewhat else, of a canon of Lichfield he was chosen
bishop of that see. Herevpon the pope vnderstanding what he was by his
Nuncio here in England, staied his consecration by his letters for a
time, and in the meane season committed his examination to the
archbishop of Canturburie, and the bishop of Rochester, who felt and
dealt so fauourablie with him in golden reasoning, that his worthinesse
was commended to the popes holinesse, &amp; to Rome he goeth. Being come to
Rome the pope himselfe apposed him, and after secret conference vtterlie
disableth his election, till he had prooued by substantiall argument and
of great weight before him also, that he was not so lightlie to be
reiected. Which kind of reasoning so well pleased his holinesse, that Ex
mera plenitudine potestatis, he was made capable of the benefice and so
returneth into England; when he came home, this bishop being in the
kings presence told him how he had doone he wist not what in preferring
so vnméet a man vnto so high a calling. With which speach the king was
so offended, that he commanded him out of hand to auoid out of his
presence. In like sort the ladie Wake then duchesse of Lancaster,
standing by, and hearing the king hir cousine to gather vp the bishop so
roundlie, and thereto an old grudge against him for some other matter,
dooth presentlie picke a quarrell against him about certeine lands then
in his possession, which he defended &amp; in the end obteined against hir
<span class="leftnote">* sic. qu. <em>a fire</em></span>
by plée and course of law: yer long also *afore hapned in a part of
hir house, for which she accused the bishop, and in the end by verdict
of twelue men found that he was priuie vnto the fact of his men in the
said fact, wherfore he was condemned in nine hundred pounds damages,
which he paid euerie penie.</p>

<p>Neuerthelesse, being sore grieued, that she had (as he said) wrested out
such a verdict against him, and therein packed vp a quest at hir owne
choise: he taketh his horsse, goeth to the court, and there complaineth
to the king of his great iniurie receiued at hir hands. But in the
deliuerie of his tale, his speech was so blockish, &amp; termes so euill
fauoredlie (though maliciouslie) placed, that the king tooke yet more
offense with him than before; insomuch that he led him with him into the
parlement house, for then was that court holden, and there before the
lords accused him of no small misdemeanor toward his person by his rude
and threatening speeches. But the bishop egerlie denieth the kings
obiections, which he still auoucheth vpon his honor; and in the end
confirmeth his allegations by witnesse: wherevpon he is banished from
the kings presence during his naturall life by verdict of that house. In
the meane time the duchesse hearing what was doone, she beginneth a new
to be dealing with him: and in a brabling fraie betweene their seruants
one of hir men was slaine, for which he was called before the magistrat,
as chiefe accessarie vnto the fact. But he fearing the sequele of his
third cause by his successe had in the two first, hideth himselfe after
he had sold all his moouables, and committed the monie vnto his trustie
<span class="page"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[Page 242]</span>
friends. And being found giltie by the inquest, the king seizeth vpon
his possessions, and calleth vp the bishop to answer vnto the trespasse.
To be short, vpon safe-conduct the bishop commeth to the kings presence,
where he denieth that he was accessarie to the fact, either before, at,
or after the deed committed, and therevpon craueth to be tried by his
péeres. But this petition was in vaine: for sentence passeth against him
also by the kings owne mouth. Wherevpon he craueth helpe of the
archbishop of Canturburie and priuileges of the church, hoping by such
meanes to be solemnlie rescued. But they fearing the kings displeasure,
who bare small fauour to the clergie of his time, gaue ouer to vse anie
such meanes; but rather willed him to submit himselfe vnto the kings
mercie which he refused, standing vpon his innocencie from the first
vnto the last. Finallie, growing into choler, that the malice of a woman
should so preuaile against him, he writeth to Rome, requiring that his
case might be heard there, as a place wherein greater iustice (saith he)
is to be looked for than to be found in England. Vpon the perusall of
these his letters also, his accusers were called thither. But for so
much as they appéered not at their peremptorie times, they were
excommunicated. Such of them also as died before their reconciliations
were taken out of the churchyards, and buried in the fields and
doong-hilles, "Vnde timor &amp; turba (saith my note) in Anglia." For the
king inhibited the bringing in and receipt of all processes, billes, and
whatsoeuer instruments should come from Rome: such also as aduentured
contrarie to this prohibition to bring them in, were either dismembred
of some ioint, or hanged by the necks. Which rage so incensed the pope,
that he wrote in verie vehement maner to the king of England,
threatening far greater cursses, except he did the sooner staie the
furie of the lady, reconcile himself vnto the bishop, and finallie,
making him amends for all his losses susteined in these broiles. Long it
was yer the king would be brought to peace. Neuerthelesse, in the end he
wrote to Rome about a reconciliation to be had betwéene them: but yer
all things were concluded, God himselfe did end the quarrell, by taking
awaie the bishop. And thus much out of an old pamphlet in effect word
for word: but I haue somewhat framed the forme of the report after the
order that Stephan Birchington dooth deliuer it, who also hath the same
in manner as I deliuer it.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Norwich.</span>
The see of Norwich called in old time Episcopatus Donnicensis, Dononiæ,
or Eastanglorum, was erected at Felstow or Felixstow, where Felix of
Burgundie (sometime schoolemaster to Sigebert of the east-Angles, by
whose persuasion also the said Sigebert erected the vniuersitie at
Cambridge) being made bishop of the east-Angles first placed his sée,
afterward it was remooued from thence to Donwich, &amp; thence to Helmham,
Anno 870, about the death of Celnothus of Canturburie; thirdlie, to
Theodford, or Thetford; &amp; finallie, after the time of the Bastard, to
Norwich. For iurisdiction it conteineth in our daies Norffolke and
Suffolke onelie, whereas at the first it included Cambridgeshire also,
and so much as laie within the kingdome of the east-Angles. It began
about the yéere 632, vnder Cerpenwald king of the east-Saxons, who
bestowed it vpon Felix, whome pope Honorius also confirmed, and after
which he held it by the space of seauenteene yéeres. It paid sometimes
at euerie alienation 5000 ducats to Rome. But in my time hir maiestie
hath 899 pounds, 8 shillings 7 pence farthing, as I haue been informed.
In the same iurisdiction also there were once 1563 parish churches, and
88 religious houses: but in our daies I can not heare of more churches
than 1200: and yet of these I know one conuerted into a barne, whilest
the people heare seruice further off vpon a greene: their bell also when
I heard a sermon there preached in the gréene, hanged in an oke for want
of a stéeple. But now I vnderstand that the oke likewise is gone. There
is neuerthelesse a litle chappellet hard by on that common, but nothing
capable of the multitude of Ashlie towne that should come to the same in
such wise, if they did repaire thither as they ought.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Peterborow.</span>
Peterborow, sometimes a notable monasterie, hath Northampton and Rutland
shires vnder hir iurisdiction, a diocesse erected also by king Henrie
the eight. It neuer paid first fruits to the pope before queene Maries
daies (if it were then deliuered) wherof I doubt, because it was not
recorded in his ancient register of tenths and fruits, although
<span class="page"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[Page 243]</span>
peraduenture the collectors left it not vngathered, I wot not for what
purpose; it yéeldeth now foure hundred and fiftie pounds, one penie
abated. I haue seene and had an ancient <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'iarror'; terrier^2. is a land register. See TN at end.">terrier</ins> of the lands of this
monasterie, which agréeth verie well with the historie of Hugo le Blanc
monke of that house. In the charter also of donation annexed to the
same, I saw one of Wulfhere king of Mercia, signed with his owne, &amp; the
marks of Sigher king of Sussex, Sebbie of Essex, with the additions of
their names: the rest of the witnesses also insued in this order:</p>

<p class="ind1">Ethelred brother to Wulfehere,<br />
Kindburg and Kindswith sisters to Wulfhere,<br />
Deusdedit archbishop,<br />
Ithamar bishop of Rochester,<br />
Wina bishop of London,<br />
Iarnman bishop of Mearc,<br />
Wilfride and Eoppa préests,<br />
Saxulfe the abbat.</p>

<p>Then all the earles and eldermen of England in order; and after all
these, the name of pope Agatho, who confirmed the instrument at the sute
of Wilfride archbishop of Yorke, in a councell holden at Rome 680, of a
hundred &amp; fiue and twentie bishops, wherein also these churches were
appropriated to the said monasterie, to wit, Breding, Reping, Cedenac,
Swinesheued, Lusgerd, Edelminglond, and Barchaing: whereby we haue in
part an euident testimonie how long the practise of appropriation of
benefices hath béene vsed to the hinderance of the gospell, and
maintenance of idle moonks, an humane inuention grounded vpon
hypocrisie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bristow.</span>
Bristow hath Dorsetshire sometime belonging to Salisburie, a sée also
latelie erected by king Henrie the eight, who tooke no small care for
the church of Christ, and therefore eased a number of ancient sées of
some part of their huge and ouer-large circuits, and bestowed those
portions deducted, vpon such other erections as he had appointed for the
better regiment and féeding of the flocke: the value thereof is thrée
hundred foure score and thrée pounds, eight shillings, and foure pence
(as I haue béene informed.)</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Lincolne.</span>
Lincolne of all other of late times was the greatest; and albeit that
out of it were taken the sees of Oxford and Peterborow, yet it still
reteineth Lincolne, Leicester, Huntingdon, Bedford, Buckingham shires,
and the rest of Hertford; so that it extendeth from the Thames vnto the
Humber, and paid vnto the pope fiue thousand ducats (as appeereth by
his note) at euerie alienation. In my time, and by reason of hir
diminution it yéeldeth a tribute to whom tribute belongeth, of the
valuation of eight hundred ninetie and nine pounds, eight shillings,
seauen pence farthing. It began since the conquest, about the beginning
of William Rufus, by one Remigius, who remooued his sée from Dorchester
to Lincolne (not without licence well paid for vnto the king.) And thus
much of the bishopriks which lie within Lhoegres or England, as it was
left vnto Locrinus. Now it followeth that I procéed with Wales.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Landaffe.</span>
Landaffe, or the church of Taw hath ecclesiasticall iurisdiction in
Glamorgan, Monmouth, Brechnoch, and Radnor shires. And although it paid
seuen hundred ducats at euerie exchange of prelat; yet is it scarselie
worth one hundred fiftie and fiue pounds by the yeare (as I haue heard
reported.) Certes it is a poore bishoprike, &amp; (as I haue heard) the late
incumbent thereof being called for not long since by the lord president
in open court made answer. The daffe is here, but the land is gone. What
he meant by it I can not well tell; but I hope, that in the séed time
and the frée planting of the gospell, the meate of the labourer shall
not be diminished and withdrawen.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">S. Dauids.</span>
S. Dauids hath Penbroke and Caermardine shires, whose liuerie or first
fruits to the sée of Rome was one thousand and fiue hundred ducats, at
the hardest (as I thinke.) For if record be of anie sufficient credit,
it is little aboue the value of foure hundred fiftie and seauen pounds,
one shilling, and ten pence farthing, in our time, and so it paieth vnto
hir maiesties coffers; but in time past I thinke it was farre better.
<span class="page"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[Page 244]</span>
The present bishop misliketh verie much of the cold situation of his
cathedrall church; and therfore he would gladlie pull it downe, and set
it in a warmer place: but it would first be learned what suertie he
would put in to sée it well performed: of the rest I speake not.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bangor.</span>
Bangor is in north-Wales, and hath Caernaruon, Angleseie, and Merioneth
shires vnder hir iurisdiction. It paid to Rome 126 ducats, which is
verie much. For of all the bishoprikes in England it is now the least
for reuenues, and not woorth aboue one hundred and one and thirtie
pounds, and sixteene pence to hir maiesties coffers at euerie alienation
(as appéereth by the tenths, which amount to much lesse than those of
some good benefice) for it yeeldeth not yéerelie aboue thirtéene pounds,
thrée shillings, and seauen pence halfe penie, as by that court is
manifest.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">S. Asaphes.</span>
S. Asaphes hath Prestholme and part of Denbigh and Flintshires vnder hir
iurisdiction in causes ecclesiasticall, which being laid togither doo
amount to little more than one good countie, and therefore in respect of
circuit the least that is to be found in Wales, neuerthelesse it paid to
Rome 470 ducates at euerie alienation. In my time the first fruits of
this bishoprike came vnto 187 pounds eleuen shillings six pence; wherby
it séemeth to be somewhat better than Landaffe or Bangor last remembred.
There is one Howell a gentleman of Flintshire in the compasse of this
iurisdiction, who is bound to giue an harpe of siluer yearelie to the
best harper in Wales, but did anie bishop thinke you deserue that in the
popish time? Howell or Aphowell in English is all one (as I haue heard)
and signifie so much as Hugo or Hugh. Hitherto of the prouince of
Canturburie, for so much therof as now lieth within the compasse of this
Iland. Now it resteth that I procéed with the curtailed archbishoprike
of Yorke, I saie curtailed because all Scotland is cut from his
iurisdiction and obedience.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Yorke.</span>
The see of Yorke was restored about the yeare of Grace 625, which after
the comming of the Saxons laie desolate and neglected, howbeit at the
said time Iustus archbishop of Canturburie ordeined Paulinus to be first
bishop there, in the time of Gadwijn king of Northumberland. This
Paulinus sate six yeares yer he was driuen from thence, &amp; after whose
expulsion that seat was void long time, wherby <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Lindeffarne'; 'f' and long 's' confusion. (Printer error).">Lindesfarne</ins> grew into
credit, and so remained vntill the daies of Oswie of Northumberland, who
sent Wilfred the priest ouer into France, there to be consecrated
archbishop of Yorke: but whilest he taried ouer long in those parts,
Oswie impatient of delaie preferred Ceadda or Chad to that roome, who
held it three yeares, which being expired Wilfred recouered his roome,
and held it as he might, vntill it was seuered in two, to wit, Yorke,
Hagulstade, or <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Lindeffarne'; 'f' and long 's' confusion. (Printer error).">Lindesfarne</ins>, where Eata was placed, at which time also
Egfride was made bishop of Lincolne or Lindsie in that part of Mercia
which he had goten from Woolfhere. Of it selfe it hath now iurisdiction
ouer Yorkeshire, Notinghamshire (whose shire towne I meane the new part
thereof with the bridge was builded by king Edward the first surnamed
the elder before the conquest) and the rest of Lancastershire onelie not
subiect to the sée of Chester; and when the pope bare authoritie in this
realme, it paid vnto his see 1000 ducates, beside 5000 for the pall of
the new elect, which was more than he could well spare of late,
considering the curtailing &amp; diminution of his sée, thorough the
erection of a new metropolitane in Scotland, but in my time it yéeldeth
1609 pounds ninetéene shillings two pence to hir maiestie, whom God long
preserue vnto vs to his glorie, hir comfort, and our welfares.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Chester.</span>
Chester vpon Dee, otherwise called Westchester, hath vnder hir
iurisdiction in causes ecclesiasticall, Chestershire, Darbishire, the
most part of Lancastershire (to wit vnto the Ribell) Richmond and a part
of Flint and Denbigh shires in Wales, was made a bishoprike by king H.
8. anno regni 33. Iulij 16, and so hath continued since that time, being
valued 420 pounds by the yeare beside od twentie pence (a streict
reckoning) as the record declareth.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Durham.</span>
Durham hath the countie of Durham and Northumberland with the Dales
onelie vnder hir iurisdiction, and hereof the bishops haue sometimes
béene earles palantines &amp; ruled the rost vnder the name of the
bishoprike and succession of S. Cuthbert. It was a sée (in mine opinion)
more profitable of late vnto hir maiesties coffers by 221 pounds
<span class="page"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[Page 245]</span>
eighteene shillings ten pence farthing, and yet of lesse countenance
than hir prouinciall, neuertheles the sunneshine thereof (as I heare) is
now somewhat eclipsed and not likelie to recouer the light, for this is
not a time wherein the church may looke to increase in hir estate. I
heare also that some other flitches haue forgone the like collops, but
let such matters be scanned by men of more discretion. Capgraue saith
how that the first bishop of this sée was called bishop of Lindseie (or
Lincolne) &amp; that Ceadda laie in Liechfield of the Mercians in a mansion
house néere the church. But this is more worthie to be remembred, that
Cuthred of the Northumbers, and Alfred of the West-saxons bestowed all
the land betwéene the These &amp; the Tine now called the bishoprike vpon S.
Cuthbert, beside whatsoeuer belonged to the see of Hagulstade. Edgar of
Scotland also in the time of the Bastard gaue Coldingham and Berwike
withall their appurtenances to that house; but whether these donations
be extant or no as yet I cannot tell. Yet I thinke not but that Leland
had a sight of them, from whome I had this ground. But whatsoeuer this
bishoprike be now, in externall &amp; outward apparance, sure it is that it
paid in old time 9000 ducates at euerie alienation to Rome, as the
record expresseth. Aidan a Scot or Irishman was the first bishop of this
sée, who held himselfe (as did manie of his successors) at Colchester
and in Lindesfarne Ile, till one came that remooued it to Durham. And
now iudge you whether the allegation of Capgraue be of anie accompt or
not.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Caerleill.</span>
Caerleill was erected 1132 by Henrie the first, and hereof one
Ethelwoolfe confessor to Osmond bishop of Sarum was made the first
bishop, hauing Cumberland &amp; Westmerland assigned to his share; of the
deaneries and number of parish churches conteined in the same as yet I
haue no knowledge, more than of manie other. Howbeit hereof I am sure,
that notwithstanding the present valuation be risen to 531 pounds
foureteene shillings eleuen pence halfe penie, the pope receiued out of
it but 1000 florens, and might haue spared much more, as an aduersarie
thereto confessed sometime euen before the pope himselfe, supposing no
lesse than to haue gained by his tale, and so peraduenture should haue
doone, if his platforme had taken place. But as wise men oft espie the
practises of flatteries, so the pope saw to what end this profitable
speach was vttered. As touching Caerleill it selfe it was sometime
sacked by the Danes, and eftsoones repared by William Rufus, &amp; planted
with a colonie of southerne men. I suppose that in old time it was
called Cairdoill. For in an ancient booke which I haue séene, and yet
haue, intituled, Liber formularum literarum curiæ Romanæ, octo
capitulorum, episcopatus Cardocensis. And thus much generallie of the
names and numbers of our bishoprikes of England, whose tenths in old
time yearelie amounting vnto 21111 pounds, twelue shillings one penie
halfe penie farthing, of currant monie in those daies, doo euidentlie
declare, what store of coine was transported out of the land vnto the
papall vses, in that behalfe onelie.</p>

<p>Certes I take this not to be one quarter of his gaines gotten by England
in those daies, for such commodities were raised by his courts holden
here, so plentifullie gat he by his perquisits, as elections,
procurations, appeales, preuentions, pluralities, tot quots, trialities,
tollerations, legitimations, bulles, seales, préests, concubines, eating
of flesh and white meats, dispensations for mariages, &amp; times of
celebration, Peter pence, and such like faculties, that not so little as
1200000 pounds went yearelie from hence to Rome. And therefore no
maruell though he séeke much in these daies to reduce vs to his
obedience. But what are the tenths of England (you will saie) in
comparison of all those of Europe. For notwithstanding that manie good
bishoprikes latelie erected be left out of his old bookes of record,
which I also haue séene, yet I find neuertheles that the whole sum of
them amounted to not aboue 61521 pounds as monie went 200 yeares before
my time, of which portion poore saint Peter did neuer heare, of so much
as one graie grote. Marke therfore I praie you whether England were not
fullie answerable to a third part of the rest of his tenths ouer all
Europe, and therevpon tell me whether our Iland was one of the best
paire of bellowes or not, that blue the fire in his kitchen, wherewith
to make his pot seeth, beside all other commodities.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[Page 246]</span></p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Man.</span>
Beside all these, we haue another bishoprike yet in England almost
slipped out of my remembrance, because it is verie obscure, for that the
bishop thereof hath not wherewith to mainteine his countenance
sufficientlie, and that is the see of Mona or Man, somtime named
Episcopatus Sodorensis, whereof one Wimundus was ordeined the first
bishop, and Iohn the second, in the troublesome time of king Stephan.
The gift of this prelacie resteth in the earles of Darbie, who nominate
such a one from time to time therto as to them dooth séeme conuenient.
Howbeit if that sée did know and might reape hir owne commodities, and
discerne them from other mens possessions (for it is supposed that the
mother hath deuoured the daughter) I doubt not but the state of hir
bishop would quicklie be amended. Hauing therefore called this later sée
after this maner vnto mind, I suppose that I haue sufficientlie
discharged my dutie concerning the state of our bishoprike, and maner
how the ecclesiasticall iurisdiction of the church of England is diuided
among the shires and counties of this realme. Whose bishops as they haue
béene heretofore of lesse learning, and yet of greater port &amp; dooings in
the common-wealth, than at this present, so are they now for the most
part the best learned that are to be found in anie countrie of Europe,
sith neither high parentage, nor great riches (as in other countries)
but onelie learning and vertue, commended somewhat by fréendship, doo
bring them to this honour.</p>

<p>I might here haue spoken more at large of diuerse other bishopriks,
sometime in this part of the Iland, as of that of Caerlheon tofore
ouerthrowen by Edelfred in the behalfe of Augustine the moonke (as
Malmesburie saith) where Dubritius gouerned, which was afterward
translated to S. Dauids, and taken for an archbishoprike: secondlie of
the bishoprike of Leircester called Legerensis, whose fourth bishop
(Vnwon) went to Rome with Offa king of Mercia: thirdlie of Ramsbirie
<span class="leftnote">Gloucester's verie ancient bishoprike.</span>
 or Wiltun, and of Glocester (of which you shall read in Matth. Westm. 489)
where the bishop was called Eldad: also of Hagulstade, one of the members
whereinto the see of Yorke was diuided after the expulsion of Wilfrid.
For (as I read) when Egfrid the king had driuen him awaie, he diuided
his see into two parts, making Bosa ouer the Deiranes that held his sée
at Hagulstade, or Lindfarne: and Eatta ouer the Bernicians, who sate at
Yorke: and thereto placing Edhedus ouer Lindseie (as is afore noted)
whose successors were Ethelwine, Edgar, and Kinibert, notwithstanding
that one Sexulfus was ouer Lindseie before Edhedus, who was bishop of
the Mercians and middle England, till he was banished from Lindseie, and
came into those quarters to séeke his refuge and succour.</p>

<p>I could likewise intreat of the bishops of Whiteherne, or Ad Candidam
Casam, an house with the countrie wherein it stood belonging to the
prouince of Northumberland, but now a parcell of Scotland; also of the
erection of the late sée at Westminster by Henrie the eight. But as the
one so the other is ceased, and the lands of this later either so
diuided or exchanged for worse tenures, that except a man should sée it
with his eies, &amp; point out with his finger where euerie parcell of them
is bestowed, but a few men would beléeue what is become of the same. I
might likewise and with like ease also haue added the successors of the
bishops of euerie sée to this discourse of their cathedrall churches and
places of abode, but it would haue extended this treatise to an
vnprofitable length. Neuerthelesse I will remember the fame of London my
natiue citie, after I haue added one word more of the house called Ad
Candidam Casam, in English Whiteherne, which taketh denomination of the
white stone wherwith it was builded, and was séene far off as standing
vpon an hill to such as did behold it.</p>

<p>And thus much of the archbishops, bishops, and deanes of that honorable
sée. I call it honorable, because it hath had a succession for the most
part of learned and wise men, albeit that otherwise it be the most
troublesome seat in England, not onelie for that it is néere vnto checke,
<span class="page"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[Page 249]</span>
but also the prelats thereof are much troubled with sutors, and no lesse
subiect to the reproches of the common sort, whose mouthes are alwaies
wide open vnto reprehension, and eies readie to espie anie thing that
they may reprooue and carpe at. I would haue doone so much for euerie
see in England, if I had not had consideration of the greatnesse of the
volume, and small benefit rising by the same, vnto the commoditie of the

<small>OF VNIUERSITIES.</small><br />

CHAP. III.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">Manie vniuersities somtime in England.</span>
There haue béene heretofore, and at sundrie times, diuerse famous
vniuersities in this Iland, and those euen in my daies not altogither
forgotten, as one at Bangor, erected by Lucius, and afterward conuerted
into a monasterie, not by Congellus (as some write) but by Pelagius the
monke. The second at Carlheon vpon Vske, neere to the place where the
riuer dooth fall into the Seuerne, founded by king Arthur. The third at
Theodford, wherein were 600 students, in the time of one Rond sometime
king of that region. The fourth at Stanford, suppressed by Augustine the
monke, and likewise other in other places, as Salisburie, Eridon or
Criclade, Lachlade, Reading, and Northampton; albeit that the two last
rehearsed were not authorised, but onelie arose to that name by the
departure of the students from Oxford in time of ciuill dissention vnto
the said townes, where also they continued but for a little season. When
that of Salisburie began, I can not tell; but that it flourished most
vnder Henrie the third, and Edward the first, I find good testimonie by
the writers, as also by the discord which fell 1278, betwéene the
chancellor for the scholers there on the one part, and William the
archdeacon on the other, whereof you shall sée more in the chronologie
<span class="leftnote">Thrée vniuersities in England.</span>
here following. In my time there are thrée noble vniuersities in
England, to wit, one at Oxford, the second at Cambridge, and the third
in London; of which, the first two are the most famous, I meane
Cambridge and Oxford, for that in them the vse of the toongs,
philosophie, and the liberall sciences, besides the profound studies of
the ciuill law, physicke, and theologie, are dailie taught and had:
whereas in the later, the laws of the realme are onelie read and
learned, by such as giue their minds vnto the knowledge of the same. In
the first there are not onelie diuerse goodlie houses builded foure
square for the most part of hard fréestone or bricke, with great numbers
of lodgings and chambers in the same for students, after a sumptuous
sort, through the excéeding liberalitie of kings, quéenes, bishops,
noblemen and ladies of the land: but also large liuings and great
reuenues bestowed vpon them (the like whereof is not to be séene in anie
other region, as Peter Martyr did oft affirme) to the maintenance onelie
of such conuenient numbers of poore mens sonnes as the seuerall stipends
bestowed vpon the said houses are able to support.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">When the vniuersities were builded vncerteine.</span>
When these two schooles should be first builded, &amp; who were their
originall founders, as yet it is vncerteine: neuerthelesse, as there is
great likelihood that Cambridge was begun by one Cantaber a Spaniard (as
I haue noted in my chronologie) so Alfred is said to be the first
beginner of the vniuersitie at Oxford, albeit that I cannot warrant the
same to be so yong, sith I find by good authoritie, that Iohn of
Beuerleie studied in the vniuersitie hall at Oxford, which was long
before Alfred was either borne or gotten. Some are of the opinion that
Cantabrigia was not so called of Cantaber, but Cair Grant of the
finisher of the worke, or at the leastwise of the riuer that runneth by
the same, and afterward by the Saxons Grantcester. An other sort affirme
that the riuer is better written Canta than Granta, &amp;c: but whie then is
not the towne called Canta, Cantium, or Cantodunum, according to the
same? All this is said onlie (as I thinke) to deface the memorie of
Cantaber, who comming from the Brigants, or out of Biscaie, called the
<span class="page"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[Page 250]</span>
said towne after his owne and the name of the region from whence he
came. Neither hath it béene a rare thing for the Spaniards heretofore to
come first into Ireland, and from thense ouer into England, sith the
chronologie shall declare that it hath béene often seene, and that out
of Britaine, they haue gotten ouer also into Scithia, and contrariwise:
coasting still through Yorkeshire, which of them also was called
Brigantium, as by good testimonie appeareth.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Oxford fiftie miles from London.</span>
Of these two, that of Oxford (which lieth west and by north from London)
standeth most pleasantlie, being inuironed in maner round about with
woods on the hilles aloft, and goodlie riuers in the bottoms and vallies
beneath, whose courses would bréed no small commoditie to that citie and
countrie about, if such impediments were remooued as greatlie annoie the
same, and hinder the cariage which might be made thither also from
London.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Cambridge six and fortie miles from London.</span>
That of Cambridge is distant from London about fortie and six miles
north and by east, and standeth verie well, sauing that it is somewhat
néere vnto the fens, whereby the wholesomenesse of the aire there is not
a little corrupted. It is excellentlie well serued with all kinds of
prouision, but especiallie of freshwater fish and wildfoule, by reason
of the riuer that passeth thereby; and thereto the Ile of Elie, which is
so néere at hand. Onlie wood is the chéefe want to such as studie there,
wherefore this kind of prouision is brought them either from Essex, and
other places thereabouts, as is also their cole; or otherwise the
necessitie thereof is supplied with gall (a bastard kind of Mirtus as I
take it) and seacole, whereof they haue great plentie led thither by the
Grant. Moreouer it hath not such store of medow ground as may suffice
for the ordinarie expenses of the towne and vniuersitie, wherefore the
inhabitants are inforced in like sort to prouide their haie from other
villages about, which minister the same vnto them in verie great
aboundance.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Longitude &amp; latitude of both.</span>
Oxford is supposed to conteine in longitude eightéene degrees and eight
and twentie minuts, and in latitude one and fiftie degrées and fiftie
minuts; whereas that of Cambridge standing more northerlie, hath twentie
degrees and twentie minuts in longitude, and therevnto fiftie and two
degrées and fifteene minuts in latitude, as by exact supputation is
easie to be found.</p>

<p>The colleges of Oxford, for curious workemanship and priuat commodities,
are much more statelie, magnificent, &amp; commodious than those of
Cambridge: and therevnto the stréets of the towne for the most part more
large and comelie. But for vniformitie of building, orderlie compaction,
<span class="leftnote">Cambridge burned not long since.</span>
and politike regiment, the towne of Cambridge, as the newer workmanship,
excéedeth that of Oxford (which otherwise is and hath béene the greater
of the two) by manie a fold (as I gesse) although I know diuerse that
are of the contrarie opinion. This also is certeine, that whatsoeuer the
difference be in building of the towne stréets, the townesmen of both
are glad when they may match and annoie the students, by incroching vpon
their liberties, and kéepe them bare by extreame sale of their wares,
whereby manie of them become rich for a time, but afterward fall againe
into pouertie, bicause that goods euill gotten doo seldome long indure.</p>

<p>Castels also they haue both, and in my iudgement is hard to be said,
whether of them would be the stronger, if ech were accordinglie repared:
howbeit that of Cambridge is the higher, both for maner of building and
situation of ground, sith Oxford castell standeth low and is not so
apparant to our sight. That of Cambridge was builded (as they saie) by
Gurguintus, sometime king of Britaine, but the other by the lord Robert
de Oilie, a noble man which came in with the conqueror, whose wife
Editha, a woman giuen to no lesse superstition than credulitie, began
also the abbeie of Oseneie neere vnto the same, vpon a fond (but yet a
rare) occasion, which we will héere remember, though it be beside my
purpose, to the end that the reader may see how readie the simple people
of that time were to be abused by the practise of the cleargie. It
happened on a time as this ladie walked about the fields, néere vnto the
aforesaid castell, to recreate hir selfe with certeine of hir maidens,
that a number of pies sat chattering vpon the elmes, which had beene
planted in the hedgerowes, and in fine so troubled hir with their noise,
that she wished them all further off, or else hir selfe at home againe,
and this happened diuerse times. In the end being wearie of hir walke,
<span class="page"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[Page 251]</span>
she demanded of hir chapleine the cause wherefore these pies did so
molest &amp; vexe hir. Oh madam (saith he) the wiliest pie of all, these are
no pies but soules in purgatorie that craue reléefe. And is it so in
déed quoth she? Now De pardieux, if old Robert will giue me leaue, I
will doo what I can to bring these soules to rest. Herevpon she
consulted, craued, wept, and became so importunate with hir husband,
that he ioined with hir, and they both began that synagog 1120, which
afterward prooued to be a notable den. In that church also lieth this
ladie buried with hir image, hauing an heart in hir hand couched vpon
the same, in the habit of a vowesse, and yet to be séene, except the
weather haue worne out the memoriall. But to procéed with my purpose.</p>

<p>In each of these vniuersities also is likewise a church dedicated to the
virgin Marie, wherein once in the yeare, to wit, in Iulie, the scholers
are holden, and in which such as haue béene called to anie degrée in the
yeare precedent, doo there receiue the accomplishment of the same, in
solemne and sumptuous maner. In Oxford this solemnitie is called an Act,
but in Cambridge they vse the French word Commensement; and such resort
is made yearelie vnto the same from all parts of the land, by the
fréends of those which doo procéed, that all the towne is hardlie able
to receiue and lodge those gests. When and by whome the churches
aforesaid were builded, I haue elsewhere made relation. That of Oxford
also was repared in the time of Edward the fourth, and Henrie the
seuenth, when doctor Fitz Iames a great helper in that worke was warden
of Merton college, but yer long after it was finished, one tempest in a
night so defaced the same, that it left few pinacles standing about the
church and stéeple, which since that time haue neuer béene repared.
There were sometime foure and twentie parish churches in the towne and
suburbes, but now there are scarselie sixtéene. There haue béene also
1200 burgesses, of which 400 dwelled in the suburbes, and so manie
students were there in the time of Henrie the third, that he allowed
them twentie miles compasse about the towne, for their prouision of
vittels.</p>

<p>The common schooles of Cambridge also are farre more beautifull than
those of Oxford, onelie the diuinitie schoole at Oxford excepted, which
for fine and excellent workemanship, commeth next the moold of the kings
chappell in Cambridge, than the which two with the chappell that king
Henrie the seauenth did build at Westminster, there are not (in mine
opinion) made of lime &amp; stone thrée more notable piles within the
compasse of Europe.</p>

<p>In all other things there is so great equalitie betwéene these two
vniuersities, as no man can imagin how to set downe any greater; so that
they séeme to be the bodie of one well ordered common wealth, onlie
diuided by distance of place, and not in fréendlie consent and orders.
In speaking therefore of the one, I can not but describe the other; and
in commendation of the first, I can not but extoll the latter; and so
much the rather, for that they are both so déere vnto me, as that I can
not readilie tell vnto whether of them I owe the most good will. Would
to God my knowledge were such, as that neither of them might haue cause
to be ashamed of their pupill; or my power so great, that I might
woorthilie requite them both for those manifold kindnesses that I haue
receiued of them. But to leaue these things, and procéed with other more
conuenient for my purpose. The manner to liue in these vniuersities, is
not as in some other of forren countries we sée dailie to happen, where
the students are inforced for want of such houses, to dwell in common
innes, and tauerns, without all order or discipline. But in these our
colleges we liue in such exact order, and vnder so precise rules of
gouernement, as that the famous learned man Erasmus of Roterodame being
here among vs 50 yeres passed, did not let to compare the trades in
liuing of students in these two places, euen with the verie rules and
orders of the ancient moonks: affirming moreouer in flat words, our
orders to be such as not onlie came néere vnto, but rather far exceeded
all the monastical instituti&#333;s that euer were deuised.</p>

<p>In most of our colleges there are also great numbers of students, of
which manie are found by the reuenues of the houses, and other by the
purueiances and helpe of their rich fréends; whereby in some one college
you shall haue two hundred scholers, in others an hundred and fiftie, in
<span class="page"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[Page 252]</span>
diuerse a hundred and fortie, and in the rest lesse numbers; as the
capacitie of the said houses is able to receiue: so that at this
present, of one sort and other, there are about thrée thousand students
nourished in them both (as by a late surueie it manifestlie appeared.)
They were erected by their founders at the first, onelie for poore mens
sons, whose parents were not able to bring them vp vnto learning: but
now they haue the least benefit of them, by reason the rich doo so
incroch vpon them. And so farre hath this inconuenience spread it selfe,
that it is in my time an hard matter for a poore mans child to come by a
felowship (though he be neuer so good a scholar &amp; woorthie of that
roome.) Such packing also is vsed at elections, that not he which best
deserueth, but he that hath most friends, though he be the woorst
scholer, is alwaies surest to spéed; which will turne in the end to the
ouerthrow of learning. That some gentlemen also, whose friends haue
beene in times past benefactors to certeine of those houses, doo intrude
into the disposition of their estates, without all respect of order or
estatutes deuised by the founders, onelie thereby to place whome they
thinke good (and not without some hope of gaine) the case is too too
euident: and their attempt would soone take place, if their superiors
did not prouide to bridle their indeuors. In some grammar schooles
likewise, which send scholers to these vniuersities, it is lamentable to
see what briberie is vsed; for yer the scholer can be preferred, such
bribage is made, that poore mens children are commonlie shut out, and
the richer sort receiued (who in time past thought it dishonor to liue
as it were vpon almes) and yet being placed, most of them studie little
other than histories, tables, dice, and trifles, as men that make not
the liuing by their studie the end of their purposes, which is a
lamentable hearing. Beside this, being for the most part either
gentlemen, or rich mens sonnes, they oft bring the vniuersities into
much slander. For standing vpon their reputation and libertie, they
ruffle and roist it out, excéeding in apparell, and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Possibly 'haunting', or 'frequenting'.">hanting</ins> riotous
companie (which draweth them from their bookes vnto an other trade.) And
for excuse when they are charged with breach of all good order, thinke
it sufficient to saie, that they be gentlemen, which gréeueth manie not
a litle. But to proceed with the rest.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Readers in priuat houses.</span>
Euerie one of these colleges haue in like maner their professors or
readers of the toongs and seuerall sciences, as they call them, which
dailie trade vp the youth there abiding priuatlie in their halles, to
the end they may be able afterward (when their turne commeth about,
which is after twelue termes) to shew themselues abroad, by going from
thence into the common schooles and publike disputations (as it were "In
aream") there to trie their skilles, and declare how they haue profited
since their comming thither.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Publike readers mainteined by the prince.</span>
Moreouer, in the publike schooles of both the vniuersities, there are
found at the princes charge (and that verie largelie) fiue professors
and readers, that is to saie, of diuinitie, of the ciuill law, physicke,
the Hebrue, and the Gréeke toongs. And for the other lectures, as of
<span class="rightnote">Studie of the quadriuials and perspectiues neglected.</span>
philosophie, logike, rhetorike, and the quadriuials, although the latter
(I meane arythmetike, musike, geometrie, and astronomie, and with them
all skill in the perspectiues are now smallie regarded in either of
them) the vniuersities themselues doo allow competent stipends to such
as reade the same, whereby they are sufficientlie prouided for, touching
the maintenance of their estates, and no lesse incoraged to be diligent
in their functions.</p>

<p>These professors in like sort haue all the rule of disputations and
other schoole exercises, which are dailie vsed in common schooles
seuerallie assigned to ech of them, and such of their hearers, as by
their skill shewed in the said disputations, are thought to haue
atteined to anie conuenient ripenesse of knowledge, according to the
custome of other vniuersities, although not in like order, are permitted
solemnlie to take their deserued degrees of schoole in the same science
and facultie wherein they haue spent their trauell. From that time
forward also, they vse such difference in apparell as becommeth their
callings, tendeth vnto grauitie, and maketh them knowne to be called to
some countenance.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Sophisters.</span>
The first degree, is that of the generall sophisters, from whence when
they haue learned more sufficientlie the rules of logike, rhetorike, and
obteined thereto competent skill in philosophie, and in the
<span class="rightnote">Batchelers of Art.</span>
mathematicals, they ascend higher vnto the estate of batchelers of
<span class="page"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[Page 253]</span>
art, after foure yeares of their entrance into their sophistrie. From
thence also giuing their minds to more perfect knowledge in some or all
the other liberall sciences, &amp; the toongs, they rise at the last (to
<span class="leftnote">Masters of art.</span>
wit, after other thrée or foure yéeres) to be called masters of art, ech
of them being at that time reputed for a doctor in his facultie, if he
professe but one of the said sciences (beside philosophie) or for his
generall skill, if he be exercised in them all. After this they are
permitted to choose what other of the higher studies them liketh to
follow, whether it be diuinitie, law, or, physike; so that being once
masters of art, the next degrée if they follow physike, is the
doctorship belonging to that profession; and likewise in the studie of
the law, if they bend their minds to the knowledge of the same. But if
they meane to go forward with diuinitie, this is the order vsed in that
profession. First, after they haue necessarilie proceeded masters of
art, they preach one sermon to the people in English, and another to the
vniuersitie in Latine. They answer all commers also in their owne
persons vnto two seuerall questions of diuinitie in the open schooles,
at one time, for the space of two hours; and afterward replie twise
against some other man vpon a like number, and on two seuerall daies in
the same place: which being doone with commendation, he receiueth the
<span class="leftnote">Batcheler of diuinitie.</span>
fourth degree, that is, batcheler of diuinitie, but not before he hath
beene master of art by the space of seauen yéeres, according to their
statutes.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Doctor.</span>
The next and last degrée of all is the doctorship after other three
yeares, for the which he must once againe performe all such exercises
and acts as are afore remembred, and then is he reputed able to gouerne
and teach others, &amp; likewise taken for a doctor. I haue read that Iohn
of Beuerleie was the first doctor that euer was in Oxford, as Beda was
in Cambridge. But I suppose herein that the word doctor is not so
strictlie to be taken in this report as it is now vsed, sith euerie
teacher is in Latine called by that name, as also such in the primitiue
church as kept schooles of catechists, wherein they were trained vp in
the rudiments and principles of religion, either before they were
admitted vnto baptisme, or anie office in the church.</p>

<p>Thus we sée, that from our entrance into the vniuersitie vnto the last
degrée receiued, is commonlie eighteene or peraduenture twentie yéeres,
in which time if a student hath not obteined sufficient learning,
thereby to serue his owne turne, and benefit his common wealth, let him
neuer looke by tarieng longer to come by anie more. For after this time
&amp; 40 yéeres of age, the most part of students doo commonlie giue ouer
their woonted diligence, &amp; liue like drone bées on the fat of colleges,
withholding better wits from the possession of their places, &amp; yet
dooing litle good in their own vocation &amp; calling. I could rehearse a
number (if I listed) of this sort, aswell in the one vniuersitie as the
other. But this shall suffice in sted of a larger report, that long
continuance in those places is either a signe of lacke of friends, or of
<span class="leftnote">This Fox builded Corpus Christi college in Oxford.</span>
learning, or of good and vpright life, as bishop Fox sometime noted, who
thought it sacrilege for a man to tarrie anie longer at Oxford than he
had a desire to profit.</p>

<p>A man may (if he will) begin his studie with the lawe, or physike (of
which this giueth wealth, the other honor) so soone as he commeth to the
vniuersitie, if his knowledge in the toongs and ripenesse of iudgement
serue therefore: which if he doo, then his first degrée is bacheler of
law, or physicke, and for the same he must performe such acts in his
owne science, as the bachelers or doctors of diuinitie, doo for their
parts, the onelie sermons except, which belong not to his calling.
Finallie, this will I saie, that the professors of either of those
faculties come to such perfection in both vniuersities, as the best
students beyond the sea doo in their owne or else where. One thing onlie
I mislike in them, and that is their vsuall going into Italie, from
whense verie few without speciall grace doo returne good men, whatsoeuer
<span class="leftnote">So much also may be inferred of lawiers.</span>
they pretend of conference or practise, chiefelie the physicians who
vnder pretense of séeking of forreine simples doo oftentimes learne the
framing of such compositions as were better vnknowen than practised, as
I haue heard oft alledged, and therefore it is most true that doctor
Turner said; Italie is not to be séene without a guide, that is, without
speciall grace giuen from God, bicause of the licentious and corrupt
behauiour of the people.</p>

<p>There is moreouer in euerie house a maister or prouost, who hath vnder
<span class="page"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[Page 254]</span>
him a president, &amp; certeine censors or deanes, appointed to looke to the
behauior and maners of the students there, whom they punish verie
seuerelie if they make anie default, according to the quantitie and
qualitie of their trespasses. And these are the vsual names of
gouernours in Cambridge. Howbeit in Oxford the heads of houses are now
and then called presidents in respect of such bishops as are their
visitors &amp; founders. In ech of these also they haue one or moe
thresurers whom they call Bursarios or Bursers beside other officers,
whose charge is to sée vnto the welfare and maintenance of these houses.
Ouer each vniuersitie also there is a seuerall chancelor, whose offices
are perpetuall, howbeit their substitutes, whom we call vicechancelors,
are changed euerie yeare, as are also the proctors, taskers, maisters of
the streates and other officers, for the better maintenance of their
policie and estate.</p>

<p>And thus much at this time of our two vniuersities in each of which I
haue receiued such degree as they haue vouchsafed rather of their fauour
than my desert to yéeld and bestow vpon me, and vnto whose students I
wish one thing, the execution whereof cannot be preiudiciall to anie
that meaneth well, as I am resolutelie persuaded, and the case now
standeth in these our daies. When anie benefice therefore becommeth
void, it were good that the patrone did signifie the vacation therof to
the bishop, and the bishop the act of the patrone to one of the
vniuersities, with request that the vicechancellor with his assistents
might prouide some such able man to succeed in the place, as should by
their iudgement be méet to take the charge vpon him. Certes if this
order were taken then should the church be prouided of good pastors, by
whome God should be glorified, the vniuersities better stored, the
simoniacall practises of a number of patrons vtterlie abolished and the
people better trained to liue in obedience toward God and their prince,
which were an happie estate.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">London.</span>
To these two also we may in like sort ad the third, which is at London
(seruing onelie for such as studie the lawes of the realme) where there
are sundrie famous houses, of which three are called by the name of Ins
of the court, the rest of the chancerie, and all builded before time for
the furtherance and commoditie of such as applie their minds to our
common lawes. Out of these also come manie scholers of great fame,
whereof the most part haue heretofore béene brought vp in one of the
aforesaid vniuersities, and prooue such commonlie as in processe of
time, rise vp (onelie through their profound skill) to great honor in
the common-wealth of England. They haue also degrées of learning among
themselues, and rules of discipline, vnder which they liue most ciuilie
in their houses, albeit that the yoonger sort of them abroad in the
streats are scarse able to be bridled by anie good order at all. Certes
this errour was woont also greatlie to reigne in Cambridge and Oxford,
betweene the students and the burgesses: but as it is well left in these
two places, so in forreine counteies it cannot yet be suppressed.
<span class="leftnote">Grammar schooles.</span>
Besides these vniuersities, also there are great number of Grammer
schooles through out the realme, and those verie liberallie indued, for
the better reliefe of poore scholers, so that there are not manie
corporat townes now vnder the quéenes dominion, that <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hain', which is an enclosed park.">haue</ins> not one Gramar
schoole at the least, with a sufficient liuing for a maister and vsher
appointed to the same.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Windsor, Winchester, Eaton, Westminster.</span>
There are in like maner diuerse collegiat churches as Windsor,
Wincester, Eaton, Westminster (in which I was sometime an vnprofitable
Grammarian vnder the reuerend father master Nowell now deane of Paules)
and in those a great number of poore scholers dailie mainteened by the
liberalitie of the founders, with meat, bookes, and apparell, from
whence after they haue béene well entered in the knowledge of the Latine
and Gréeke toongs, and rules of versifieng (the triall whereof is made
by certeine apposers yearelie appointed to examine them) they are sent
to certeine especiall houses in each vniuersitie, where they are
<span class="leftnote">* <em>and</em>?</span>
receiued * the trained vp, in the points of higher knowledge in their
priuat hals, till they be adiudged meet to shew their faces in the
schooles, as I haue said alreadie. And thus much haue I thought good to
note of our vniuersities, and likewise of colleges in the same, whose
names I will also set downe here, with those of their founders, to the
end the zeale which they bare vnto learning may appeare, and their
remembrance neuer perish from among the wise and learned.</p>

<p>There are also in Oxford certeine hostels or hals, which may rightwell

<p>The students also that remaine in them, are called hostelers or
halliers. Hereof it came of late to passe, that the right reuerend
father in God Thomas late archbishop of Canturburie being brought vp in
such an house at Cambridge, was of the ignorant sort of Londoners called
an hosteler, supposing that he had serued with some inholder in the
stable, and therfore in despite diuerse hanged vp bottles of haie at his
gate, when he began to preach the gospell, whereas in déed he was a
gentleman borne of an ancient house &amp; in the end a faithfull witnesse of
Iesus Christ, in whose quarrell he refused not to shed his bloud and
yéeld vp his life vnto the furie of his aduersaries.</p>

<p>Besides these there is mention and record of diuerse other hals or
hostels, that haue béene there in times past, as Beefe hall, Mutton
hall, &amp;c: whose ruines yet appéere: so that if antiquitie be to be

<p>And thus much in generall of our noble vniuersities, whose lands some
gréedie gripers doo gape wide for, and of late haue (as I heare)
propounded sundrie reasons, whereby they supposed to haue preuailed in
their purposes. But who are those that haue attempted this sute, other
than such as either hate learning, pietie, and wisedome; or else haue
spent all their owne, and know not otherwise than by incroching vpon
other men how to mainteine themselues? When such a motion was made by
some vnto king Henrie the eight, he could answer them in this maner; Ah
sirha, I perceiue the abbeie lands haue fleshed you and set your téeth
on edge, to aske also those colleges. And whereas we had a regard onelie
to pull downe sinne by defacing the monasteries, you haue a desire also
to ouerthrow all goodnesse by subuersion of colleges. I tell you sirs
that I iudge no land in England better bestowed than that which is giuen
to our vniuersities, for by their maintenance our realme shall be well
gouerned when we be dead and rotten. As you loue your welfares therfore,
<span class="leftnote">Now abbeies be gone, our dingthrifts prie
after church and college possessions.</span>
follow no more this veine, but content your selues with that you haue
alreadie, or else seeke honest meanes whereby to increase your liuelods,
for I loue not learning so ill, that I will impaire the reuenues of anie
one house by a pennie, whereby it may be vpholden. In king Edwards daies
likewise the same was once againe attempted [as I haue heard] but in
vaine, for saith the duke of Summerset among other spéeches tending to
that end, who also made answer therevnto in the kings presence by his
assignation; If lerning decaie, which of wild men maketh ciuill, of
<span class="page"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[Page 257]</span>
blockish and rash persons wise and godlie counsellors, of obstinat
rebels obedient subiects, and of euill men good and godlie christians;
what shall we looke for else but barbarisme and tumult? For when the
lands of colleges be gone, it shall be hard to saie, whose staffe shall
stand next the doore, for then I doubt not but the state of bishops,
rich farmers, merchants, and the nobilitie shall be assailed, by such as
liue to spend all, and thinke that what so euer another man hath is more
meet for them, and to be at their commandement, than for the proper
owner that hath sweat and laboured for it. In quéene Maries daies the
weather was too warme for anie such course to be taken in hand, but in
the time of our gratious quéene Elizabeth, I heare that it was after a
sort in talke the third time, but without successe as mooued also out of
season, and so I hope it shall continue for euer. For what comfort
should it be for anie good man to sée his countrie brought into the
estate of the old Gothes &amp; Vandals, who made lawes against learning, and
would not suffer anie skilfull man to come into their councell house, by
meanes whereof those people became sauage, tyrants, and mercilesse
helhounds, till they restored learning againe, and thereby fell to
ciuilitie.</p>

<small>OF THE PARTITION OF ENGLAND INTO SHIRES AND COUNTIES.</small><br />

CHAP. IV.</h3>

<p>In reding of ancient writers, as Cæsar, Tacitus, and others, we find
mention of sundrie regions to haue béene sometime in this Iland, as the
Nouantæ, Selgouæ, Dannonij, Gadeni, Oradeni, Epdij, Cerones, Carnonacæ,
Careni, Cornabij, Caledonij, Decantæ, Logi, Mertæ, Vacomagi, Venicontes,
Texali or Polij, Denani, Elgoui, Brigantes Parisi, Ordouici aliàs
Ordoluci, Cornauij, Coritani, Catieuchlani, Simeni, Trinouantes, Demetæ,
Cangi, Silures, Dobuni, Atterbatij, Cantij, Regni, Belgæ, Durotriges,
Dumnonij, Giruij, Murotriges, Seueriani, Iceni, Tegenes, Casij,
Cænimagni, Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bibroci, and Kentishmen, and such
like. But sith the seuerall places where most of them laie, are not yet
verie perfectlie knowne vnto the learned of these daies, I doo not meane
to pronounce my iudgement vpon such doubtfull cases, least that in so
dooing I should but increase coniectures, and leading peraduenture the
reader from the more probable, intangle his mind in the end with such as
are of lesse value, and things nothing so likelie to be true, as those
which other men haue remembred and set downe before me. Neither will I
speake oughts of the Romane partitions, &amp; limits of their legions, whose
number and place of abode, except of the Victorian and Augustane, is to
me vtterlie vnknowne.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Alfred brought England into shires, which the Britons
diuided by cantreds, and the first Saxons by families.</span>
It shall suffice therfore to begin with such a ground as from whence
some better certeintie of things may be deriued, and that is with the
estate of our Iland in the time of Alfred, who first diuided England
into shires, which before his daies, and since the comming of the
Saxons, was limited out by families and hidelands, as the Britons did
the same in their time, by hundreds of townes, which then were called
cantreds; as old records doo witness.</p>

<p>Into how manie shires the said Alfred did first make this partition of
the Iland, it is not yet found out; howbeit if my coniecture be anie
thing at all, I suppose that he left not vnder eight and thirtie, sith
we find by no good author, that aboue fifteene haue beene added by anie
of his successours, since the time of his decease. This prince therefore
<span class="leftnote">Shire and share all one.</span>
hauing made the generall partition of his kingdome into shires, or
shares, he diuided againe the same into lathes, as lathes into hundreds,
and hundreds into tithings, or denaries, as diuers haue written; and
maister Lambert following their authorities, hath also giuen out, saieng
almost after this maner in his description of Kent; "The Danes (saith
he) both before, &amp; in the time of king Alfred, had flocked by the sea
coasts of this Iland in great numbers, sometimes wasting and spoiling
with sword and fire, wheresoeuer they might arriue, and somtime taking
<span class="page"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[Page 258]</span>
great booties with them to their ships, without dooing anie further hurt
<span class="rightnote">Englishmen noisome to their owne countrie.</span>
or damage to the countrie. This inconuenience continuing for manie
yéeres togither, caused our husbandmen to abandon their tillage, and
gaue occasion and hardinesse to euill disposed persons, to fall to the
like pillage, as practising to follow the Danes in these their thefts
and robberies. And the better to cloake their mischeefe withall, they
feigned themselues to be Danish pirats, and would sometime come a land
in one port, and sometime in another, driuing dailie great spoiles (as
the Danes had doone) vnto their ships before them. The good king Alfred
therefore (who had maruellouslie trauelled in repelling the barbarous
Danes) espieng this outrage, and thinking it no lesse the part of a
politike prince, to root out the noisome subiect, than to hold out the
forren aduersarie: by the aduise of his nobilitie, and the example of
Moses (who followed the counsell of Iethro his father in law to the like
effect) diuided the whole realme into certeine parts or sections, which
(of the Saxon word Schyran, signifieng to cut) he termed shires, or as
we yet speake, shares, or portions, of which some one hath fortie miles
in length (as Essex) and almost so manie broad, Hereford foure &amp; twentie
in length, and twentie in breadth, and Warwike six and thirtie in
length, &amp;c: and some of them also conteine ten, twelue, thirteene,
sixtéene, twentie, or thirtie hundreds, more or lesse, as some hundreds
doo sixteene, twentie, thirtie, fortie, fiftie or sixtie townes, out of
which the king was alwaies to receiue an hundred able men to serue him
in the warres, or a hundred men able to be pledges, and ouer each of the
<span class="leftnote">Earle and alderman.</span>
portions he appointed either an earle or alderman, or both, to whome he
committed the gouernement of the same. These shires also he brake into
lesser parts, whereof some were called lathes, of the word Gelathian,
which is to assemble togither; other hundreds, for that they enioied
iurisdiction ouer an hundred pledges; and other tithings, bicause there
were in each of them to the number of ten persons, whereof euerie one
from time to time was suertie for others good abearing. He prouided also
that euerie man should procure himselfe to be receiued into some
tithing, to the end, that if anie were found of so small and base a
credit, that no man would become pledge or suertie for him, he should
forthwith be committed to prison, least otherwise he might happen to doo
more harme abroad. Hitherto master Lambert." By whose words we may
gather verie much of the state of this Iland in the time of Alfred,
whose institution continued after a sort vntill the comming of the
Normans, who changed the gouernement of the realme in such wise (by
bringing in of new officers and offices, after the maner of their
countries) that verie little of the old regiment remained more than the
bare names of some officers (except peraduenture in Kent) so that in
these daies it is hard to set downe anie great certeintie of things as
they stood in Alfreds time, more than is remembred and touched at this
present.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">What a lath is.</span>
Some as it were roming or rouing at the name Lath, doo saie that it is
deriued of a barne, which is called in old English a lath, as they
coniecture. From which spéech in like sort some deriue the word Laistow,
as if it should be trulie written Lath stow, a place wherein to laie vp
or laie on things, of whatsoeuer condition. But hereof as yet I cannot
absolutelie be satisfied, although peraduenture some likelihood in their
iudgements may séeme to be therein. Other vpon some further
consideration affirme that they were certeine circuits in euerie countie
or shire conteining an appointed number of townes, whose inhabitants
alwaies assembled to know and vnderstand of matters touching their
portions, in to some one appointed place or other within their limits,
especiallie whilest the causes were such as required not the aid or
<span class="leftnote">Léetes.</span>
assistance of the whole countie. Of these lathes also (as they saie)
some shires had more, some lesse, as they were of greatnesse. (And M.
Lambert séemeth to be of the opinion, that the leets of our time wherein
these pledges be yet called Franci plegij of the word Free burgh) doo
yeeld some shadow of that politike institution of Alfred. But sith my
skill is so small in these cases that I dare not iudge anie thing at all
as of mine owne knowledge, I will not set downe anie thing more than I
read, least I should roue at randon in our obscure antiquities, and
reading no more of lathes my next talke shall be of hundreds.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Hundred or wapentake.</span>
The hundred and the wapentake is all one, as I read in some, and by this
<span class="page"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[Page 259]</span>
diuision not a name appertinent to a set number of townes (for then all
hundreds should be of equall quantitie) but a limited iurisdiction,
within the compasse whereof were an hundred persons called
<span class="leftnote">Denarie or tithing.</span>
pledges (as I said) or ten denaries, or tithings of men, of
which ech one was bound for others good abering, and laudable
behauiour in the common-wealth of the realme. The chiefe man likewise of
euerie denarie or tithing was in those daies called a tithing man, in
<span class="rightnote">Tithing man in Latine Decurio Borsholder.</span>
Latine Decurio, but now in most places a borsholder or burgholder, as in
<span class="leftnote">Burrow.</span>
Kent; where euerie tithing is moreouer named a burgh or burrow, although
that in the West countrie he be still called a tithing man, and his
circuit a tithing, as I haue heard at large. I read furthermore (and it
is partlie afore noted) that the said Alfred caused ech man of frée
condition (for the better maintenance of his peace) to be ascribed into
some hundred by placing himselfe in one denarie or other, where he might
alwais haue such as should sweare or saie vpon their certeine knowledge
for his honest behauiour and ciuill conuersation if it should happen at
anie time, that his credit should come in question. In like sort I
gather out of Leland and other, that if anie small matter did fall out
worthie to be discussed, the tithing man or borsholder (now officers, at
the commandement of the high constable of which euerie hundred hath one
at the least) should decide the same in their léetes, whereas the great
causes were referred to the hundreds, the greater to the lathes, and the
greatest of all to the shire daies, where the earles or aldermen did set
themselues, &amp; make finall ends of the same, according vnto iustice. For
<span class="leftnote">Twelue men.</span>
this purpose likewise in euerie hundred were twelue men chosen of good
age and wisedome, and those sworne to giue their sentences without
respect of person, and in this maner (as they gather) were things
handeled in those daies. Which waie the word wapentake came in vse, as
yet I cannot tell; howbeit the signification of the same declareth (as I
conceiue) that at the chiefe towne the soldiers which were to serue in
that hundred did méet, fetch their weapons, &amp; go togither from thence to
the field, or place of seruice by an ordinarie custome, then generallie
knowen amongst them. It is supposed also that the word Rape commeth a
Rapiendo, as it were of catching and snatching, bicause the tenants of
the hundred or wapentakes met vpon one or sundrie daies &amp; made quicke
dispatch of their lords haruest at once and in great hast. But whether
it be a true imagination or not as yet I am vncerteine, and therefore it
lieth not in me to determine anie thing thereof: wherefore it shall
suffice to haue touched them in this maner.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Fortie shires in England, thirtéene in Wales.</span>
In my time there are found to be in England fourtie shires, and likewise
thirtéene in Wales, and these latter erected of late yeares by king
Henrie the eight, who made the Britons or Welshmen equall in all
respects vnto the English, and brought to passe that both nations should
indifferentlie be gouerned by one law, which in times past were ordred
by diuerse, and those far discrepant and disagreing one from another: as
by the seuerall view of the same is yet easie to be discerned. The names
of the shires in England are these, whereof the first ten lie betwéene
the British sea and the Thames, as Polydor also dooth set them downe.</p>

<div class="shires">
<p>
Kent.<br />
Sussex.<br />
Surreie.<br />

Cornewall.</p>
</div>

<p>There are moreouer on the northside of the Thames, and betwéene the same
and the riuer Trent, which passeth through the middest of England (as
Polydor saith) sixtéene other shires, whereof six lie toward the east,
the rest toward the west, more into the middest of the countrie.</p>

<div class="shires">
<p>
Essex, somtime all forrest saue one hundred.<br />
Middlesex.<br />

<p>So that in the portion sometime called Lhoegres, there are now fortie shires.
In Wales furthermore are thirtéene, whereof seuen are in Southwales:</p>

<p>In Northwales likewise are six, that is to saie</p>

<div class="shires">
<p>
Angleseie.<br />
Carnaruon.<br />
Merioneth.<br />
Denbigh.<br />
Flint.<br />
Montgomerie.</p>
</div>

<p>Which being added to those of England yéeld fiftie and thrée shires or
counties, so that vnder the quéenes Maiestie are so manie counties,
whereby it is easilie discerned, that hir power farre excéedeth that of
Offa, who of old time was highlie honored for that he had so much of
Britaine vnder his subiection as afterward conteined thirtie nine
shires, when the diuision was made, whereof I spake before.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Od parcels of shires.</span>
This is moreouer to be noted in our diuision of shires, that they be not
alwaies counted or laid togither in one parcell, whereof I haue great
maruell. But sith the occasi&#333; hath growen (as I take it) either by
priuilege or some like occasion, it is better briefelie to set downe how
some of these parts lie than to spend the time in séeking a iust cause
of this their od diuision. First therefore I note that in the part of
Buckinghamshire betweene Amondesham, and Beconsfield, there is a peece
of Hartfordshire to be found, inuironed round about with the countie of
Buckingham, and yet this patch is not aboue three miles in length and
two in breadth at the verie most. In Barkeshire also betwéene Ruscombe
and Okingham is a péece of Wilshire, one mile in breadth and foure miles
in length, whereof one side lieth on the Loden riuer. In the borders of
Northamptonshire directlie ouer against Luffeld a towne in
Buckinghamshire, I find a parcell of Oxfordshire not passing two miles
in compasse.</p>

<p>With Oxfordshire diuerse doo participate, in so much that a péece of
Glocestershire, lieth halfe in Warwikeshire &amp; halfe in Oxfordshire, not
verie far from Horneton. Such another patch is there, of Glocestershire
not far from long Compton, but lieng in Oxford countie: &amp; a péece of
Worcestershire, directlie betwéene it &amp; Glocestershire. Glocester hath
the third péece vpon the north side of the Winrush neere Falbrocke, as
Barkeshire hath one parcell also vpon the selfe side of the same water,
in the verie edge of Glocestershire: likewise an other in Oxfordshire,
not verie farre from Burford: and the third ouer against Lach lade, which
<span class="page"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[Page 261]</span>
which is parted from the main countie of Barkeshire, by a little strake
of Oxfordshire. Who would thinke that two fragments of Wilshire were to
be seene in Barkeshire vpon the Loden, and the riuer that falleth into
it: whereof and the like sith there are verie manie, I thinke good to
giue this briefe admonition. For although I haue not presentlie gone
thorough with them all, yet these may suffice to giue notice of this
thing, wherof most readers (as I persuade my selfe) are ignorant.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Lieutenants.</span>
But to procéed with our purpose. Ouer ech of these shires in time of
necessitie is a seuerall lieutenant chosen vnder the prince, who being a
noble man of calling, hath almost regall authoritie ouer the same for
the time being in manie cases which doo concerne his office: otherwise
<span class="leftnote">Shiriffes.</span>
it is gouerned by a shiriffe (a word deriued of Schire and Greue, and
pronounced as Shire and Reue) whose office is to gather vp and bring his
accounts into the excheker, of the profits of his countie receiued,
whereof he is or may be called Quæstor comitatus or Prouinciæ. This
officer is resident and dwelling somewhere within the same countie, and
called also a viscount, Quasi vicarius comitis or Procomes, in respect
of the earle (or as they called him in time past the alderman) that
beareth his name of the countie, although it be seldome séene in
England, that the earle hath anie great store of possessions, or oughts
to doo in the shire whereof he taketh his name, more than is allowed to
him, through his personall resiance, if he happen to dwell and be
resident in the same.</p>

<p>In the election also of these magistrates, diuerse able persons aswell
for wealth as wisedome are named by the commons, at a time and place
appointed for their choise, whose names being deliuered to the prince,
he foorthwith pricketh some such one of them, as he pleaseth to assigne
vnto that office, to whome he committeth the charge of the countie, and
who herevpon is shiriffe of that shire for one whole yeare, or vntill a
<span class="leftnote">Vndershiriffes.</span>
new be chosen. The shiriffe also hath his vnder shiriffe that ruleth &amp;
holdeth the shire courts and law daies vnder him, vpon sufficient
caution vnto the high shiriffe for his true execution of iustice,
preseruation from impeachment, and yéelding of accompt when he shall be
<span class="leftnote">Bailiffes.</span>
therevnto called. There are likewise vnder him certeine bailiffes, whose
office is to serue and returne such writs and processes as are directed
vnto them from the high shiriffe: to make seisure of the goods and
cattels, and arrest the bodies of such as doo offend, presenting either
their persons vnto him, or at the leastwise taking sufficient bond, or
other assurance of them for their dutifull appearance at an appointed
time, when the shiriffe by order of law ought to present them to the
iudges according to his charge. In euerie hundred also are one or more
<span class="leftnote">High constables.</span>
high constables according to the quantitie thereof, who receiuing the
writs and injunctions from the high shiriffe vnder his seale, or from
anie other officers of the prince, either for the prouision of vittels
or for other causes, or priuat purueiance of cates for the maintenance
<span class="leftnote">Petie constables.</span>
of the roiall familie, doo forthwith charge the petie constables of
euerie towne within their limits, with the execution of the same.</p>

<p>In each countie likewise are sundrie law daies holden at their appointed
<span class="leftnote">Motelagh.</span>
seasons, of which some retaine the old Saxon name, and are called
Motelagh, of the word motes and law. They haue also an other called the
<span class="rightnote">Shiriffes turne.</span>
shiriffes turne, which they hold twise in their times, in euerie
hundred, according to the old order appointed by king Edgar (as king
Edward reduced the folkmote ordeined by king Arthur to be held yearelie
on the first of Maie, vntill the first of euerie moneth) and in these
two latter such small matters as oft arise amongst the inferior sort of
people, are heard and well determined. They haue finallie their quarter
sessions, wherein they are assisted by the iustices and gentlemen of the
<span class="leftnote">Gaile deliuerie or great assises.</span>
countrie, &amp; twise in the yeare gaile deliuerie, at which time the iudges
ride about in their circuits, into euerie seuerall countie (where the
nobilitie and gentlemen with the iustices there resiant associat them) &amp;
minister the lawes of the realme, with great solemnitie &amp; iustice.
Howbeit in dooing of these things, they reteine still the old order of
the land in vse before the conquest. For they commit the full
examination of all causes there to be heard, to the consideration of
twelue sober, graue, and wise men, chosen out of the same countie; and
foure of them of necessitie out of the hundred where the action lieth,
<span class="page"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[Page 262]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Inquests.</span>
or the defendant inhabiteth (which number they call an inquest) &amp; of
these inquests there are more or lesse impanneled at euerie assise, as
the number of cases there to be handled dooth craue and require, albeit
that some one inquest hath often diuerse matters to consider of. And
when they haue (to their vttermost power) consulted and debated of such
things as they are charged withall, they returne againe to the place of
iustice, with their verdict in writing, according wherevnto the iudge
dooth pronounce his sentence, be it for life or death, or anie other
matter what soeuer is brought before him. It is also verie often séene,
that such as are nominated to be of these inquests, doo after their
charge receiued seldome or neuer eat or drinke, vntill they haue agréed
upon their verdict, and yeelded it vp vnto the iudge of whome they
receiued the charge; by meanes whereof sometimes it commeth to passe
that diuerse of the inquest haue béene welneere famished, or at least
taken such a sickenesse thereby, as they haue hardlie auoided. And this
commeth by practise, when the one side feareth the sequele, and
therefore conueieth some one or more into the iurie, that will in his
behalfe neuer yéeld vnto the rest, but of set purpose put them to this
trouble.</p>

<p>Certes it is a common practise (if the vnder shiriffe be not the better
man) for the craftier or stronger side to procure and packe such a
quest, as he himselfe shall like of, whereby he is sure of the issue
before the charge be giuen: and beside this if the matter doo iustlie
procéed against him, it is a world to sée now and then how the honest
yeomen that haue Bona fide discharged their consciences shall be sued of
<span class="leftnote">Atteinct.</span>
an atteinct, &amp; bound to appéere at the Starre chamber, with what rigor
they shall be caried from place to place, countie to countie, yea and
sometime in carts, which hath and dooth cause a great number of them to
absteine from the assises, &amp; yeeld to paie their issues, rather than
they would for their good meaning be thus disturbed &amp; dealt withall.
Sometimes also they bribe the bailiffes to be kept at home, whervpon
poore men, not hauing in their pursses wherewith to beare their costes,
are impanelled vpon iuries, who verie often haue neither reason nor
iudgement to performe the charge they come for. Neither was this kind of
seruice at anie time halfe so painefull as at this present: for vntill
of late yeares (that the number of lawiers and atturneies hath so
exceedinglie increased, that some shifts must néeds be found and matters
sought out, whereby they may be set on worke) a man should not haue
heard at one assise of more than two or thrée Nisi priùs, but verie
seldome of an atteinct, wheras now an hundred &amp; more of the first and
one or two of the later are verie often perceiued, and some of them for
a cause arising of sixpence or tweluepence. Which declareth that men are
growen to be farre more contentious than they haue béene in time past,
and readier to reuenge their quarels of small importance, whereof the
lawiers complaine not. But to my purpose, from whence I haue now
digressed.</p>

<p>Beside these officers afore mentioned, there are sundrie other in euerie
countie, as crowners, whose dutie is to inquire of such as come to their
death by violence, to attach &amp; present the plées of the crowne, to make
inquirie of treasure found, &amp;c. There are diuerse also of the best
<span class="leftnote">Iustices of peax &amp; quorum.</span>
learned of the law, beside sundrie gentlemen, where the number of
lawiers will not suffice (and whose reuenues doo amount to aboue twentie
pounds by the yeare) appointed by especiall commission from the prince,
to looke vnto the good gouernement of hir subiects, in the counties
where they dwell. And of these the least skilfull in the law are of the
peace, the other both of the peace and quorum, otherwise called of Oier
and Determiner, so that the first haue authoritie onelie to heare, the
other to heare and determine such matters as are brought vnto their
presence. These also doo direct their warrants to the kéepers of the
gailes within their limitations, for the safe kéeping of such offendors
as they shall iudge worthie to commit vnto their custodie there to be
kept vnder ward, vntill the great assises, to the end their causes may
be further examined before the residue of the countie, &amp; these officers
were first deuised about the eightéene yeare of Edward the third, as I
haue béene informed.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Quarter sessions.</span>
They méeting also &amp; togither with the shiriffes, doo hold their
aforesaid sessions at foure times in the yeare, whereof they are called
quarter sessions, and herein they inquire of sundrie trespasses, and the
<span class="page"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[Page 263]</span>
common annoiances of the kings liege people, and diuerse other things,
<span class="rightnote">Petie sessions.</span>
determining vpon them as iustice dooth require. There are also a third
kind of sessions holden by the high constables and bailiffes afore
mentioned, called petie sessions, wherein the weights and measures are
perused by the clarke of the market for the countie, who sitteth with
them. At these méetings also vittellers, and in like sort seruants,
labourers, roges and runnagates, are often reformed for their excesses,
although the burning of vagabounds through their eare be referred to the
quarter sessions or higher courts of assise, where they are iudged
either to death, if they be taken the third time, &amp; haue not since their
second apprehension applied themselues to labour, or else to be set
perpetuallie to worke in an house erected in euerie shire for that
purpose, of which punishment they stand in greatest feare.</p>

<p>I might here deliuer a discourse of sundrie rare customes and courts,
surnamed barons, yet mainteined and holden in England: but forsomuch as
some of the first are beastlie, and therefore by the lords of the soiles
now liuing conuerted into monie, being for the most part deuised in the
beginning either by malicious or licentious women, in méere contempt and
slauish abuse of their tenants, vnder pretense of some punishment due
for their excesses, I passe ouer to bring them vnto light, as also the
remembrance of sundrie courts baron likewise holden in strange maner;
yet none more absurd and far from law than are kept yearlie at Kings
hill in Rochford, and therfore may well be called a lawlesse court, as
most are that were deuised vpon such occasions. This court is kept vpon
wednesdaie insuing after Michaelmasse daie after midnight, so that it is
begun and ended before the rising of the sunne. When the tenants also
are altogither in an alehouse, the steward secretlie stealeth from them
with a lanterne vnder his cloke, and goeth to the Kings hill, where
sitting on a mole-hill he calleth them with a verie soft voice, writing
their appéerance vpon a péece of paper with a cole, hauing none other
light than that which is inclosed in the lanterne: so soone as the
tenants also doo misse the steward, they runne to the hill with all
their might, and there answer all at once, Here here, wherby they escape
their amercements: which they should not doo if he could haue called
ouer his bill of names before they had missed him in the alehouse. And
this is the verie forme of the court deuised at the first (as the voice
goeth) vpon a rebellion made by the tenants of the honour of Raibie
against their lord, in perpetuall memorie of their disobedience shewed.
I could beside this speake also of some other, but sith one hath taken
vpon him to collect a number of them into a particular treatise, I
thinke it sufficient for me to haue said so much of both.</p>

<p>And thus much haue I thought good to set downe generallie of the said
counties and their maner of gouernance, although not in so perfect order
as the cause requireth, bicause that of all the rest there is nothing
wherewith I am lesse acquainted than with our temporall regiment, which
(to saie truth) smallie concerneth my calling. What else is to be added
after the seuerall shires of England with their ancient limits (as they
agreed with the diuision of the land in the time of Ptolomie and the
Romans) and commodities yet extant, I reserue vnto that excellent
treatise of my fréend W. Cambden, who hath trauelled therein verie
farre, &amp; whose worke written in Latine shall in short time (I hope) be
published, to the no small benefit of such as will read and peruse the
same.</p>

<h3><a name="d2-cap5" id="d2-cap5"></a>
<small>OF DEGREES OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF ENGLAND.</small><br />

CHAP. V.</h3>

<p>We in England diuide our people commonlie into foure sorts, as
gentlemen, citizens or burgesses, yeomen, which are artificers, or
laborers. Of gentlemen the first and chéefe (next the king) be the
prince, dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, and barons: and these are
called gentlemen of the greater sort, or (as our common vsage of spéech
<span class="page"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[Page 264]</span>
is) lords and noblemen: and next vnto them be knights, esquiers, and
last of all they that are simplie called gentlemen; so that in effect
our gentlemen are diuided into their conditions, wherof in this chapiter
I will make particular rehearsall.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Prince.</span>
The title of prince dooth peculiarlie belong with vs to the kings eldest
sonne, who is called prince of Wales, and is the heire apparant to the
crowne; as in France the kings eldest sonne hath the title of Dolphine,
and is named peculiarlie Monsieur. So that the prince is so termed of
the Latine word Princeps, sith he is (as I may call him) the cheefe or
principall next the king. The kings yoonger sonnes be but gentlemen by
birth (till they haue receiued creation or donation from their father of
higher estate, as to be either visconts, earles, or dukes) and called
after their names, as lord Henrie, or lord Edward, with the addition of
the word Grace, properlie assigned to the king and prince, and now also
by custome conueied to dukes, archbishops, and (as some saie) to
marquesses and their wiues.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Duke.</span>
The title of duke commeth also of the Latine word Dux, à ducendo,
bicause of his valor and power ouer the armie: in times past a name of
office due to the emperour, consull, or chéefe gouernour of the whole
armie in the Romane warres: but now a name of honor, although perished
in England, whose ground will not long beare one duke at once; but if
there were manie as in time past, or as there be now earles, I doo not
thinke but that they would florish and prosper well inough.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Marquesse.</span>
In old time he onelie was called marquesse, Qui habuit terram
limitaneam, a marching prouince vpon the enimies countries, and thereby
bound to kéepe and defend the frontiers. But that also is changed in
common vse, and reputed for a name of great honor next vnto the duke,
euen ouer counties, and sometimes small cities, as the prince is pleased
to bestow it.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Earle.</span>
The name of earle likewise was among the Romans a name of office, who
had Comites sacri palatij, comites ærarij, comites stabuli, comites
patrimonij, largitionum, scholarum, commerciorum, and such like. But at
the first they were called Comites, which were ioined in commission with
the proconsull, legate, or iudges for counsell and aids sake in each of
those seuerall charges. As Cicero epistola ad Quintum fratrem
remembreth, where he saith; "Atque inter hos quos tibi comites, &amp;
adiutores, negotiorum publicorum dedit ipsa respublica duntaxat finibus
his præstabis, quos ante præscripsi, &amp;c." After this I read also that
euerie president in his charge was called Comes, but our English Saxons
vsed the word Hertoch and earle for Comes, and indifferentlie as I
gesse, sith the name of duke was not in vse before the conquest.
Coropius saith, that Comes and Graue is all one, to wit the viscont,
<span class="leftnote">Viscont.</span>
called either Procomes, or Vicecomes: and in time past gouerned in the
countie vnder the earle, but now without anie such seruice or office, it
is also become a name of dignitie next after the earle, and in degrée
before the baron. His reléefe also by the great charter is one hundred
pounds, as that of a baronie a hundred marks, and of a knight fiue at
the most for euerie fée.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Baron.</span>
The baron, whose degrée answered to the dignitie of a senator in Rome,
is such a frée lord as hath a lordship or baronie, whereof he beareth
his name, &amp; hath diuerse knights or fréeholders holding of him, who with
him did serue the king in his wars, and held their tenures in Baronia,
that is, for performance of such seruice. These Bracton (a learned
writer of the lawes of England in king Henrie the thirds time) tearmeth
Barones, quasi robur belli. The word Baro indéed is older than that it
may easilie be found from whence it came: for euen in the oldest
histories both of the Germans and Frenchmen, written since the conquest,
we read of barons, and those are at this daie called among the Germans
Liberi vel Ingenui, or Freihers in the Germane toong as some men doo
coniecture, or (as one saith) the citizens and burgesses of good townes
and cities were called Barones. Neuerthelesse by diligent inquisition it
is imagined, if not absolutelie found, that the word Baro and Filius in
the old Scithian or Germane language are all one; so that the kings
children are properlie called Barones, from whome also it was first
translated to their kindred, and then to the nobilitie and officers of
greatest honour indifferentlie. That Baro and Filius signifieth one
<span class="page"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[Page 265]</span>
thing, it yet remaineth to be séene, although with some corruption: for
to this daie, euen the common sort doo call their male children barnes
here in England, especiallie in the north countrie, where that word is
yet accustomablie in vse. And it is also growne into a prouerbe in the
south, when anie man susteineth a great hinderance, to saie, I am
beggered and all my barnes. In the Hebrue toong (as some affirme) it
signifieth Filij solis, and what are the nobilitie in euerie kingdome
but Filij or serui regum? But this is farre fetched, wherefore I
conclude, that from hensefoorth the originall of the word Baro shall not
be anie more to seeke: and the first time that euer I red thereof in
anie English historie, is in the reigne of Canutus, who called his
nobilitie and head officers to a councell holden at Cirnecester, by that
name, 1030, as I haue else-where remembred. Howbeit the word Baro dooth
not alwaies signifie or is attributed to a noble man by birth or
creation, for now and then it is a title giuen vnto one or other with
his office, as the chéefe or high tribune of the excheker is of custome
called lord chéefe baron, who is as it were the great or principall
receiuer of accounts next vnto the lord treasuror, as they are vnder him
are called Tribuni ærarij, &amp; rationales. Hervnto I may ad so much of the
word lord, which is an addition going not seldome and in like sort with
sundrie offices, and to continue so long as he or they doo execute the
same, and no longer.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bishops.</span>
Vnto this place I also referre our bishops, who are accounted
honourable, called lords, and hold the same roome in the parlement house
with the barons, albeit for honour sake the right hand of the prince is
giuen vnto them, and whose countenances in time past were much more
glorious than at this present it is, bicause those lustie prelats sought
after earthlie estimation and authoritie with farre more diligence than
after the lost shéepe of Christ, of which they had small regard, as men
being otherwise occupied and void of leisure to attend vpon the same.
Howbeit in these daies their estate remaineth no lesse reuerend than
before, and the more vertuous they are that be of this calling, the
better are they estéemed with high and low. They reteine also the
ancient name (lord) still, although it be not a little impugned by such
as loue either to heare of change of all things, or can abide no
<span class="rightnote">1. Sam <sup>b</sup> 15.<br />
1. Reg. <sup>3</sup> 7.</span>
superiours. For notwithstanding it be true, that in respect of function,
the office of the eldership is equallie distributed betwéene the bishop
and the minister, yet for ciuill gouernements sake, the first haue more
authoritie giuen vnto them by kings and princes, to the end that the
rest maie thereby be with more ease reteined within a limited compasse
of vniformitie, than otherwise they would be, if ech one were suffered
to walke in his owne course. This also is more to be maruelled at, that
verie manie call for an alteration of their estate, crieng to haue the
word lord abolished, their ciuill authoritie taken from them, and the
present condition of the church in other things reformed; whereas to
saie trulie, few of them doo agrée vpon forme of discipline and
gouernement of the church succedent: wherein they resemble the Capuans,
of whome Liuie dooth speake in the slaughter of their senat. Neither is
it possible to frame a whole monarchie after the patterne of one towne
or citie, or to stirre vp such an exquisite face of the church as we
imagine or desire, sith our corruption is such that it will neuer yéeld
to so great perfection: for that which is not able to be performed in a
priuat house, will much lesse be brought to passe in a common-wealth and
kingdome, before such a prince be found as Xenophon describeth, or such
an orator as Tullie hath deuised. But whither am I digressed from my
discourse of bishops, whose estates doo daily decaie, &amp; suffer some
diminution? Herein neuerthelesse their case is growne to be much better
than before, for whereas in times past the cleargie men were feared
bicause of their authoritie and seuere gouernment vnder the prince, now
are they beloued generallie for their painefull diligence dailie shewed
in their functions and callings, except peraduenture of some hungrie
wombes, that couet to plucke &amp; snatch at the loose ends of their best
commodities; with whom it is (as the report goeth) a common guise, when
a man is to be preferred to an ecclesiasticall liuing, what part thereof
he will first forgo and part with to their vse. Finallie, how it
standeth with the rest of the clergie for their places of estate, I
neither can tell nor greatlie care to know. Neuerthelesse with what
degrées of honour and worship they haue béene matched in times past
<span class="page"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[Page 266]</span>
<span class="rightnote">De Asia, cap. 12.</span>
Iohannes Bohemus in his De omnium gentium moribus, and others doo
expresse; and this also found beside their reports, that in time past
euerie bishop, abbat, and pelting prior were placed before the earles
and barons in most statutes, charters, and records made by the prince,
as maie also appeare in the great charter, and sundrie yeares of Henrie
the third, wherein no duke was heard of. But as a number of their odious
comparisons and ambitious titles are now decaied and worthilie shroonke
in the wetting, so giuing ouer in these daies to mainteine such pompous
vanitie, they doo thinke it sufficient for them to preach the word, &amp;
hold their liuings to their sées (so long as they shall be able) from
the hands of such as indeuour for their owne preferrement to fléece and
diminish the same. This furthermore will I adde generallie in
commendation of the cleargie of England, that they are for their
knowlege reputed in France, Portingale, Spaine, Germanie and Polonia, to
be the most learned diuines, although they like not anie thing at all of
their religion: and thereto they are in deed so skilfull in the two
principall toongs, that it is accounted a maime in anie one of them, not
to be exactlie seene in the Greeke and Hebrue, much more then to be
vtterlie ignorant or nothing conuersant in them. As for the Latine toong
<span class="leftnote">No Gréeke, no grace.</span>
it is not wanting in anie of the
ministerie, especiallie in such as haue beene made within this twelue or
fourtéene yeares, whereas before there was small choise, and manie cures
were left vnserued, bicause they had none at all. And to saie truth, our
aduersaries were the onelie causers hereof. For whilest they made no
<span class="leftnote">Bene con, bene can, bene le.</span>
further accompt of their priesthood, than to construe, sing, read their
seruice and their portesse, it came to passe that vpon examination had,
few made in quéene Maries daies, and the later end of king Henrie, were
able to doo anie more, and verie hardlie so much, so void were they of
further skill, and so vnapt to serue at all.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Duke, marquesse, earle, viscont.</span>
Dukes, marquesses, earles, visconts, and barons, either be created of
the prince, or come to that honor by being the eldest sonnes or highest
in succession to their parents. For the eldest sonne of a duke during
his fathers life is an erle, the eldest sonne of an erle is a baron, or
sometimes a viscont, according as the creation is. The creation I call
the originall donation and condition of the honour giuen by the prince
for good seruice doone by the first ancestor, with some aduancement,
which with the title of that honour is alwaies giuen to him and his
heires males onelie. The rest of the sonnes of the nobilitie by the
rigor of the law be but esquiers: yet in common spéech all dukes and
marquesses sonnes, and earles eldest sonnes be called lords, the which
name commonlie dooth agrée to none of lower degrée than barons, yet by
law and vse these be not esteemed barons.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Barons.</span>
The baronie or degrée of lords dooth answer to the degree of senators of
Rome (as I said) and the title of nobilitie (as we vse to call it in
England) to the Romane Patricij. Also in England no man is commonlie
created baron, except he maie dispend of yearelie reuenues a thousand
pounds, or so much as maie fullie mainteine &amp; beare out his countenance
and port. But visconts, erles, marquesses, and dukes excéed them
according to the proportion of their degrée &amp; honour. But though by
chance he or his sonne haue lesse, yet he kéepeth this degree: but if
the decaie be excessiue and not able to mainteine the honour, as
Senatores Romani were amoti à senatu: so sometimes they are not admitted
to the vpper house in the parlement although they keepe the name of lord
still, which can not be taken from them vpon anie such occasion. The
most of these names haue descended from the French inuention, in whose
histories we shall read of them eight hundred yeares passed.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Of the second degrée of gentlemen.</span>
This also is worthie the remembrance, that Otto the first emperour of
that name, indeuouring to restore the decaied estate of Italie vnto some
part of hir pristinate magnificence, did after the French example giue
Dignitates &amp; prædia to such knights and souldiers as had serued him in
the warres, whom he also adorned with the names of dukes, marquesses,
earles, valuasors or capteins, and valuasines.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Prædia.</span>
His Prædia in like maner were tributes, tolles, portage, bankage,
stackage, coinage, profits by saltpits, milles, water-courses (and
whatsoeuer emoluments grew by them) &amp; such like. But at that present I
read not that the word Baro was brought into those parts. And as for the
valuasors, it was a denomination applied vnto all degrées of honor vnder
<span class="page"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[Page 267]</span>
the first three (which are properlie named the kings capteins) so that
they are called Maiores, minores, &amp; minimi valuasores. This also is to
be noted, that the word capteine hath two relations, either as the
possessor therof hath it from the prince, or from some duke, marquesse,
or earle, for each had capteins vnder them. If from the prince, then are
<span class="leftnote">Valuasores.</span>
they called Maiores valuasores, if from anie of his thrée péeres, then
were they Minores valuasores: but if anie of these Valuasors doo
substitute a deputie, those are called Minimi valuasores, and their
deputies also Valuasini, without regard vnto which degrée the valuasor
dooth apperteine: but the word Valuasor is now growne out of vse,
wherefore it sufficeth to haue said thus much of that function.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Knights.</span>
Knights be not borne, neither is anie man a knight by succession, no not
the king or prince: but they are made either before the battell, to
incourage them the more to aduenture &amp; trie their manhood: or after the
battell ended, as an aduancement for their courage and prowesse alreadie
<span class="leftnote">Milites.</span>
shewed (&amp; then are they called Milites;) or out of the warres for some
great seruice doone, or for the singular vertues which doo appeare in
them, and then are they named Equites aurati, as common custome
intendeth. They are made either by the king himselfe, or by his
commission and roiall authoritie giuen for the same purpose: or by his
lieutenant in the warres. This order seemeth to answer in part to that
<span class="leftnote">Equites aurati.</span>
which the Romans called Equitum Romanorum. For as Equites Romani were
chosen Ex censu, that is, according to their substance and riches; so be
knights in England most commonlie according to their yearelie reuenues
or aboundance of riches, wherewith to mainteine their estates. Yet all
that had Equestrem censum, were not chosen to be knights, and no more be
all made Knights in England that may spend a knights lands, but they
onelie whome the prince will honour. Sometime diuerse ancient gentlemen,
burgesses, and lawiers, are called vnto knighthood by the prince, and
neuerthelesse refuse to take that state vpon them, for which they are of
custome punished by a fine, that redoundeth vnto his cofers, and to saie
truth, is oftentimes more profitable vnto him than otherwise their
seruice should be, if they did yeeld vnto knighthood. And this also is a
cause, wherefore there be manie in England able to dispend a knights
liuing, which neuer come vnto that countenance, and by their owne
consents. The number of the knights in Rome was also vncerteine: and so
is it of knights likewise with vs, as at the pleasure of the prince. And
whereas the Equites Romani had Equum publicum of custome bestowed vpon
them, the knights of England haue not so, but beare their owne charges
in that also, as in other kind of furniture, as armorie méet for their
defense and seruice. This neuerthelesse is certeine, that who so may
dispend 40 pounds by the yeare of frée land, either at the coronation of
the king, or mariage of his daughter, or time of his dubbing, may be
inforced vnto the taking of that degrée, or otherwise paie the reuenues
of his land for one yeare, which is onelie fortie pounds by an old
proportion, and so for a time be acquited of that title. We name him
knight in English that the French calleth Cheualier, and the Latins
Equitem, or Equestris ordinis virum. And when any man is made a knight,
he knéeling downe is striken of the king or his substitute with his
sword naked vpon the backe or shoulder, the prince, &amp;c: saieng, "Soyes
cheualier au nom de Dieu." And when he riseth vp the king saith
"Aduances bon cheualier." This is the maner of dubbing knights at this
present, and the tearme (dubbing) is the old tearme for that purpose and
not creation, howbeit in our time the word (making) is most in vse among
the common sort.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Knights of the bath.</span>
At the coronation of a king or queene, there be other knights made with
longer and more curious ceremonies, called knights of the bath. But how
soeuer one be dubbed or made knight, his wife is by and by called madame
or ladie, so well as the barons wife; he himselfe hauing added to his
name in common appellation this syllable Sir, which is the title whereby
we call our knights in England. His wife also of courtesie so long as
she liueth is called my ladie, although she happen to marie with a
gentleman or man of meane calling, albeit that by the c&#333;omon law she
hath no such prerogatiue. If hir first husband also be of better birth
than hir second, though this later likewise be a knight, yet in that she
<span class="page"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[Page 268]</span>
pretendeth a priuilege to loose no honor through courtesie yéelded to
hir sex, she will be named after the most honorable or worshipfull of
both, which is not séene elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Knights of the garter.</span>
The other order of knighthood in England, and the most honorable is that
of the garter, instituted by king Edward the third, who after he had
gained manie notable victories, taken king Iohn of France, and king
Iames of Scotland (and kept them both prisoners in the Tower of London
at one time) expelled king Henrie of Castile the bastard out of his
realme, and restored Don Petro vnto it (by the helpe of the prince of
Wales and duke of Aquitaine his eldest sonne called the Blacke prince)
he then inuented this societie of honour, and made a choise out of his
owne realme and dominions, and throughout all christendome of the best,
most excellent and renowmed persons in all vertues and honour, and
adorned them with that title to be knights of his order, giuing them a
garter garnished with gold and pretious stones, to weare dailie on the
left leg onlie: also a kirtle, gowne, cloke, chaperon, collar, and other
solemne and magnificent apparell, both of stuffe and fashion exquisite &amp;
heroicall to weare at high feasts, &amp; as to so high and princelie an
order apperteineth. Of this companie also he and his successors kings
and queenes of England, be the souereignes, and the rest by certeine
statutes and lawes amongst themselues be taken as brethren and fellowes
in that order, to the number of six and twentie, as I find in a certeine
treatise written of the same, an example whereof I haue here inserted
word for word, as it was deliuered vnto me, beginning after this maner.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Round table.</span>
I might at this present make a long tractation of the round table and
estate of the knights thereof, erected sometimes by Arthur the great
monarch, of this Iland; and therevnto intreat of the number of his
knights, and ceremonies belonging to the order, but I thinke in so
dooing that I should rather set downe the latter inuentions of other
men, than a true description of such ancient actions as were performed
in deed. I could furthermore with more facilitie describe the roialtie
of Charles the great &amp; his twelue péeres, with their solemne rites and
vsages: but vnto this also I haue no great deuotion, considering the
truth hereof is now so stained with errours and fables inserted into the
same by the lewd religious sort, that except a man should professe to
lie with them for companie, there is little sound knowledge to be
gathered hereof worthie the remembrance. In like maner diuerse aswell
subiects as princes haue attempted to restore againe a round table in
<span class="leftnote">Roger Mortimer.</span>
this land (as for example Roger lord Mortimer at Killingworth) but such
were the excessiue charges apperteining therevnto (as they did make
allowance) and so great molestation dailie insued therevpon, beside the
bréeding of sundrie quarrels among the knights, and such as resorted
hitherto from forreine countries (as it was first vsed) that in fine
they gaue it ouer, and suffered their whole inuentions to perish and
decaie, till Edward the third deuised an other order not so much
pestered with multitude of knights as the round table, but much more
honorable for princelie port and countenance, as shall appeare
hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The occasion of the deuise.</span>
The order of the garter therefore was deuised in the time of king Edward
the third, and (as some write) vpon this occasion. The quéenes maiestie
then liuing, being departed from his presence the next waie toward hir
lodging, he following soone after happened to find hir garter, which
slacked by chance and so fell from hir leg, vnespied in the throng by
such as attended vpon hir. His groomes &amp; gentlemen also passed by it,
disdaining to stoope and take vp such a trifle: but he knowing the
owner, commanded one of them to staie and reach it vp to him. Why and
like your grace (saieth a gentleman) it is but some womans garter that
hath fallen from hir as she followed the quéenes maiestie. What soeuer
<span class="leftnote">Peradventure but a blue ribbon.</span>
it be (quoth the king) take it vp and giue it me. So when he had
receiued the garter, he said to such as stood about him: You my maisters
doo make small account of this blue garter here (and therewith held it
out) but if God lend me life for a few moneths, I will make the proudest
of you all to reuerence the like. And euen vpon this slender occasion he
gaue himselfe to the deuising of this order. Certes I haue not read of
anie thing, that hauing had so simple a begining hath growne in the end
to so great honour and estimation. But to proceed. After he had studied
awhile about the performance of his deuise, and had set downe such
<span class="page"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[Page 269]</span>
orders as he himselfe inuented concerning the same, he proclamed a
roiall feast to be holden at Windsore, whither all his nobilitie
resorted with their ladies, where he published his institution, and
foorthwith inuested an appointed number into the afore said fellowship,
whose names insue, himselfe being the souereigne and principall of that
companie. Next vnto himselfe also he placed</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Admission.</span>
Being elected, preparation is made for his installing at Windsore (the
place appointed alwaies for this purpose) whereat it is required that
his banner be set vp, of two yardes and a quarter in length, and thrée
quarters in bredth, besides the fringe. Secondlie his sword of
whatsoeuer length him séemeth good. Thirdlie his helme, which from the
charnell vpwards ought to be of thrée inches at the least. Fourthlie the
crest, with mantels to the helme belonging, of such conuenient stuffe
and bignesse, as it shall please him to appoint.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[Page 270]</span></p>

<p class="ind">Item a plate of armes at the backe of his stall, and crest with mantels
and beasts supportant, to be grauen in the mettall.</p>

<p class="ind">Item lodging scutcheons of his armes, inuironed with a garter, and
painted in paper or cloth of buckram, which when he trauelleth by the
waie are to be fixed in the common Ins where he dooth lodge, as a
testimonie of his presence and staies from time to time as he did
trauell.</p>

<p class="ind">Item two mantels, one to remaine in the college at Windsore, the other
to vse at his pleasure, with the scutcheon of the armes of S. George in
the garter with laces, tasselets, and knops of blue silke and gold
belonging to the same.</p>

<p class="ind">Item a surcote or gowne of red or crimosine veluet, with a whood of the

<p class="ind">Item a collar of the garter of thirtie ounces of gold Troie weight.</p>

<p class="ind">Item a scutcheon of the armes of S. George in the garter to set vpon the
mantell. And this furniture is to be prouided against his installation.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Installation.</span>
When anie knight is to be installed, he hath with his former letters, a
garter sent vnto him, and when he commeth to be installed, he is brought
into the chapter house, where incontinentlie his commission is read
before the souereigne, or his deputie, and the assemblie present: from
hence he is lead by two knights of the said order, accompanied with the
other of the nobilitie, and officers toward the chappell, hauing his
mantell borne before him, either by a knight of the order, or else the
king at armes, to whome it secondarilie apperteineth to beare it. This
<span class="leftnote">Mantell.</span>
mantell shall be deliuered vnto him for his habit, after his oth taken
before his stall, and not before: which doone, he shall returne vnto the
chapter house, where the souereigne, or his deputie, shall deliuer him
his collar, and so he shall haue the full possession of his habit. As
<span class="leftnote">Stall.</span>
for his stall, it is not giuen according vnto the calling and
countenance of the receiuer, but as the place is that happeneth to be
void, so that each one called vnto this knighthood (the souereigne, and
emperours, and kings, and princes alwaies excepted) shall haue the same
seat, which became void by the death of his predecessor, howsoeuer it
fall out: wherby a knight onlie oftentimes dooth sit before a duke,
without anie murmuring or grudging at his roome, except it please the
souereigne, once in his life onelie to make a generall alteration of
those seats, and to set each one according to his degrée.</p>

<p>Now as touching the apparell of these knights, it remaineth such as king
Edward, the first deuiser of this order left it, that is to saie, euerie
yeare one of the colours, that is to say, scarlet, sanguine in grain,
blue and white. In like sort the kings grace hath at his pleasure the
content of cloth for his gowne and whood, lined with white satine or
damaske, and multitude of garters with letters of gold.</p>

<p class="ind">The prince hath fiue yardes of cloth for his gowne and whood, and
<span class="leftnote">A timber conteineth fortie skins, peltes, or felles.</span>
garters with letters of gold at his pleasure, beside fiue timber of the
finest mineuer.</p>

<p class="ind">A duke hath fiue yardes of woollen cloth, fiue timber of mineuer, 120

<p class="ind">A marques hath fiue yards of woollen cloth, fiue timber of mineuer, 110

<p>And this order to be holden generallie among the knights of this
companie, which are six and twentie in number, and whose patrone in time
of superstition was supposed to be S. George, of whome they were also
called S. Georges knights as I haue heard reported. Would to God they
might be called knights of honor, or by some other name, for the title
of saint George argueth a wrong patrone.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Installation.</span>
Furthermore at his installation he is solemnelie sworne, the maner
whereof I haue thought good also to annex, in this maner. You being
chosen to be one of the honorable companie of the order of the Garter,
shall promise and sweare vpon the holie euangelies by you bodilie
touched, to be faithfull and true to the kings maiestie, and to obserue
and kéepe all the points of the statutes of the said order, and euerie
article in them conteined, the same being agréeable and not repugnant to
the kings highnesse other godlie procéedings, so far as to you belongeth
&amp; apperteineth, as God you helpe, &amp;c. And thus much haue I thought good
to note touching the premisses.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Estatutes.</span>
As touching the estatutes belonging to this order they are manie, and
therefore not to be touched here. Howbeit if anie doubt doo arise aboue
the interpretation of them, the king who is the perpetuall souereigne of
that order hath to determine and resolue the same. Neither are anie
chosen therevnto vnder the degree of a knight, and that is not a
gentelman of bloud and of sound estimation.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Gentleman of bloud.</span>
And for the better vnderstanding what is meant by a gentleman of bloud,
he is defined to descend of thrée descents of noblenesse, that is to
saie, of name and of armes both by father and mother.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Degrées of reproch.</span>
There are also foure degrées of reproch, which may inhibit from the
entrance into this order: of which the first is heresie lawfullie
prooued, the second high treason, the third is flight from the battell,
the fourth riot and prodigall excesse of expenses, whereby he is not
likelie to hold out, and mainteine the port of knight of this order,
according to the dignitie thereof. Moreouer touching the wearing of
<span class="leftnote">Apparell.</span>
their aforesaid apparell, it is their custome to weare the same, when
they enter into the chappell of S. George or be in the chapter house of
their order, or finallie doo go about anie thing apperteining to that
companie. In like sort they weare also their mantels vpon the euen of S.
George, and go with the souereigne, or his deputie in the same in maner
of procession from the kings great chamber vnto the chappell, or vnto
the college, and likewise backe againe vnto the aforsaid place, not
putting it from them, vntill supper be ended, and the auoid doone. The
next daie they resort vnto the chappell also in the like order, &amp; from
thence vnto diner, wearing afterward their said apparell vnto euening
praier, and likewise all the supper time, vntill the auoid be finished.
In the solemnitie likewise of these feasts, the thirtéene chanons there,
and six and twentie poore knights haue mantels of the order, whereof
those for the chanons are of Murreie with a roundell of the armes of S.
George, the other of red, with a scutcheon onelie of the said armes.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Sicke or absent.</span>
If anie knight of this order be absent from this solemnitie vpon the
euen and daie of S. George, and be inforced not to be present either
through bodilie sicknesse, or his absence out of the land: he dooth in
the church, chappell, or chamber where he is remaining, prouide an
honorable stall for the kings maiestie in the right hand of the place
with a cloth of estat, and cushions, and scutchion of the garter, and
therein the armes of the order. Also his owne stall of which side soeuer
it be distant from the kings or the emperours in his owne place,
appointed so nigh as he can, after the maner and situation of his stall
at Windsore, there to remaine, the first euening praier on the euen of
S. George, or thrée of the clocke, and likewise the next daie during the
time of the diuine seruice, vntill the morning praier, and the rest of
the seruice be ended: and to weare in the meane time his mantell onelie,
<span class="page"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[Page 272]</span>
with the George and the lace, without either whood, collar or surcote.
Or if he be so sicke that he doo kéepe his bed, he dooth vse to haue
that habit laid vpon him during the times of diuine seruice aforesaid.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Offering.</span>
At the seruice time also vpon the morrow after S. George, two of the
chiefe knights (sauing the deputie of the souereigne if he himselfe be
absent) shall offer the kings banner of armes, then other two the sword
with the hilts forwards, which being doone the first two shall returne
againe, and offer the helme and crest, hauing at each time two heralds
of armes going before, according to the statutes. The lord deputie or
lieutenant vnto the kings grace, for the time being, alone and assisted
with one of the chiefe lords, dooth deliuer at his offering a péece of
gold, and hauing all the king of armes and heralds going before him, he
so procéedeth to the offering. When he hath thus offered for the prince,
he returneth with like solemnitie vnto his stall, and next of all goeth
againe with one herald to offer for himselfe, whose oblation being made,
euerie knight according to their stals, with an herald before him
procéedeth to the offering.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Buriall.</span>
What solemnitie is vsed at the buriall of anie knight of the Garter, it
is but in vaine to declare: wherefore I will shew generallie what is
doone at the disgrading of one of these knights, if through anie
grieuous offense he be separated from this companie. Whereas otherwise
the signe of the order is neuer taken from him vntill death doo end &amp;
finish vp his daies. Therfore when anie such thing is doone,
promulgation is made therof after this maner insuing.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Disgrading.</span>
Be it knowne vnto all men that N.N. knight of the most noble order of
the Garter, is found giltie of the abhominable and destestable crime of
high treason, for he hath most traitorouslie conspired against our most
high and mightie prince souereigne of the said order, contrarie to all
right, his dutie, and the faithfull oth, which he hath sworne and taken.
For which causes therefore he hath deserued to be deposed from this
noble order, and fellowship of this Garter. For it may not be suffered
that such a traitor and disloiall member remaine among the faithfull
knights of renowmed stomach &amp; bountifull prowes, or that his armes
should be mingled with those of noble chiualrie. Wherefore our most
excellent prince and supreme of this most honorable order, by the aduise
and counsell of his collegues, willeth and commandeth that his armes
which he before time hath deserued shall be from hencefoorth be taken
awaie and throwne downe: and he himselfe cleane cut off from the
societie of this renowmed order, and neuer from this daie reputed anie
more for a member of the same, that all other by his example may
hereafter beware how they commit the like trespasse, or fall into such
notorious infamie and rebuke. This notice being giuen, there resorteth
vnto the partie to be disgraded certeine officers with diuerse of his
late fellowes appointed, which take from him his George, and other
inuestiture, after a solemne maner.</p>

<p>And hitherto of this most honorable order, hoping that no man will be
offended with me, in vttering thus much. For sith the noble order of the
Toison Dor or golden fléese, with the ceremonies apperteining vnto the
creation and inuestiture of the six and thirtie knights thereof: and
likewise that of saint Michaell and his one and thirtie knights, are
discoursed vpon at large by the historiographers of their owne
countries, without reprehension or checke, especiallie by Vincentius
Lupan. lib. 1. de Mag. Franc. cap. de equitibus ordinis, where he
calleth them Cheualliers sans reproche, and thereto addeth that their
chaine is commonlie of two hundred crownes at the least, and honour
thereof so great, that it is not lawfull for them to sell, giue or laie
the same to morgage (would to God they might once brooke their name,
Sans reproche, but their generall deling in our time with all men, will
not suffer some of the best of their owne countries to haue that opinion
of them) I trust I haue not giuen anie cause of displeasure, briefelie
to set foorth those things that apperteine vnto our renowmed order of
<span class="leftnote">* Some think that this was the answer of the quéene,
when the king asked what men would think of her,
in loosing the garter after such a maner.</span>
the Garter, in whose compasse is written commonlie, *"Honi soit qui
mal y pense," which is so much to saie, as, "Euill come to him that
euill thinketh:" a verie sharpe imprecation, and yet such as is not
contrarie to the word, which promiseth like measure to the meter, as he
dooth mete to others.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[Page 273]</span></p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Bannerets.</span>
There is yet an other order of knights in England called knights
Bannerets, who are made in the field with the ceremonie of cutting awaie
the point of his penant of armes, and making it as it were a banner, so
that being before but a bacheler knight, he is now of an higher degree,
and allowed to displaie his armes in a banner, as barrons doo. Howbeit
these knights are neuer made but in the warres, the kings standard being
vnfolded.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Esquire.</span>
Esquire (which we call commonlie squire) is a French word, and so much
in Latine as Scutiger vel armiger, and such are all those which beare
armes, or armoires, testimonies of their race from whence they be
descended. They were at the first costerels or bearers of the armes of
barons, or knights, &amp; thereby being instructed in martiall knowledge,
had that name for a dignitie giuen to distinguish them from common
souldiers called Gregarij milites when they were togither in the field.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Gentlemen.</span>
Gentlemen be those whome their race and bloud, or at the least their
vertues doo make noble and knowne. The Latines call them Nobiles &amp;
generosos, as the French do Nobles or Gentlehommes. The etymologie of
the name expoundeth the efficacie of the word: for as Gens in Latine
betokeneth the race and surname: so the Romans had Cornelios, Sergios,
Appios, Curios, Papyrios, Scipiones, Fabios, Æmilios, Iulios, Brutos,
&amp;c: of which, who were Agnati, and therefore kept the name, were also
called Gentiles, gentlemen of that or that house and race.</p>

<p>Moreouer as the king dooth dubbe knights, and createth the barons and
higher degrees, so gentlemen whose ancestors are not knowen to come in
with William duke of Normandie (for of the Saxon races yet remaining we
now make none accompt, much lesse of the British issue) doo take their
beginning in England, after this maner in our times. Who soeuer studieth
<span class="leftnote">Lawiers students in vniuersities.<br />
Physicians.<br />
Capteins.</span>
the lawes of the realme, who so abideth in the vniuersitie giuing his
mind to his booke, or professeth physicke and the liberall sciences, or
beside his seruice in the roome of a capteine in the warres, or good
counsell giuen at home, whereby his common-wealth is benefited, can liue
without manuell labour, and thereto is able and will beare the port,
charge, and countenance of a gentleman, he shall for monie haue a cote
and armes bestowed vpon him by heralds (who in the charter of the same
doo of custome pretend antiquitie and seruice, and manie gaie things)
and therevnto being made so good cheape be called master, which is the
title that men giue to esquiers and gentlemen, and reputed for a
gentleman euer after. Which is so much the lesse to be disalowed of, for
that the prince dooth loose nothing by it, the gentleman being so much
subiect to taxes and publike paiments as is the yeoman or husbandman,
which he likewise dooth beare the gladlier for the sauing of his
reputation. Being called also to the warres (for with the gouernment of
the common-wealth he medleth litle) what soeuer it cost him, he will
both arraie &amp; arme himselfe accordinglie, and shew the more manly
courage, and all the tokens of the person which he representeth. No man
hath hurt by it but himselfe, who peraduenture will go in wider buskens
than his legs will beare, or as our prouerbe saith, now and then beare a
bigger saile than his boat is able to susteine.</p>

<p>Certes the making of new gentlemen bred great strife sometimes amongst
the Romans, I meane when those which were Noui homines, were more
allowed of for their vertues newlie séene and shewed, than the old smell
of ancient race, latelie defaced by the cowardise &amp; euill life of their
nephues &amp; defendants* could make the other to be. But as enuie hath no
<span class="leftnote">* Sic.&mdash;qu. de<em>p</em>endants?</span>
affinitie with iustice and equitie, so it forceth not what language the
malicious doo giue out, against such as are exalted for their wisdomes.
This neuerthelesse is generallie to be reprehended in all estates of
gentilitie, and which in short time will turne to the great ruine of our
countrie, and that is the vsuall sending of noblemens &amp; meane gentlemens
sonnes into Italie, from whence they bring home nothing but meere
atheisme, infidelitie, vicious conuersation, &amp; ambitious and proud
behauiour, wherby it commeth to passe that they returne far worsse men
than they went out. A gentleman at this present is newlie come out of
Italie, who went thither an earnest protestant, but comming home he
could saie after this maner: Faith &amp; truth is to be kept, where no losse
or hinderance of a further purpose is susteined by holding of the same;
and forgiuenesse onelie to be shewed when full reuenge is made. Another
<span class="page"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[Page 274]</span>
no lesse forward than he, at his returne from thence could ad thus much;
He is a foole that maketh accompt of any religion, but more foole that
will loose anie part of his wealth, or will come in trouble for constant
leaning to anie: but if he yéeld to loose his life for his possession,
he is stark mad, and worthie to be taken for most foole of all the rest.
This gaie bootie gate these gentlemen by going into Italie, and hereby a
man may see what fruit is afterward to be looked for where such blossoms
doo appéere. I care not (saith a third) what you talke to me of God, so
as I may haue the prince &amp; the lawes of the realme on my side. Such men
as this last, are easilie knowen; for they haue learned in Italie, to go
vp and downe also in England, with pages at their héeles finelie
apparelled, whose face and countenance shall be such as sheweth the
master not to be blind in his choise. But least I should offend too
much, I passe ouer to saie anie more of these Italionates and their
demeanor, which alas is too open and manifest to the world, and yet not
called into question.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Citizens and burgesses.</span>
Citizens and burgesses haue next place to gentlemen, who be those that
are free within the cities, and are of some likelie substance to beare
office in the same. But these citizens <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ro'">or</ins>
burgesses <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'rae'">are</ins> to serue the
commonwealth in their cities and boroughs, or in corporat townes where
they dwell. And in the common assemblie of the realme wherein our lawes
are made, for in the counties they beare but little swaie (which
assemblie is called the high court of parlement) the ancient cities
appoint foure, and the boroughs two burgesses to haue voices in it, and
giue their consent or dissent vnto such things as passe or staie there
in the name of the citie or borow, for which they are appointed.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Merchants.</span>
In this place also are our merchants to be installed, as amongst the
citizens (although they often change estate with gentlemen, as gentlemen
doo with them, by a mutuall conuersion of the one into the other) whose
number is so increased in these our daies, that their onelie maintenance
is the cause of the exceeding prices of forreine wares, which otherwise
when euerie nation was permitted to bring in hir owne commodities, were
farre better cheape and more plentifullie to be had. Of the want of our
commodities here at home, by their great transportation of them into
other countries, I speake not, sith the matter will easilie bewraie it
selfe. Certes among the Lacedemonians it was found out, that great
numbers of merchants were nothing to the furtherance of the state of the
commonwealth: wherefore it is to be wished that the huge heape of them
were somewhat restreined, as also of our lawiers, so should the rest
liue more easilie vpon their owne, and few honest chapmen be brought to
decaie, by breaking of the bankerupt. I doo not denie but that the nauie
of the land is in part mainteined by their traffike, and so are the high
prices of wares kept vp now they haue gotten the onelie sale of things,
vpon pretense of better furtherance of the common-wealth into their owne
hands: whereas in times past when the strange bottoms were suffered to
come in, we had sugar for foure pence the pound, that now at the writing
of this treatise is well worth halfe a crowne, raisons or corints for a
penie that now are holden at six pence, and sometime at eight pence and
ten pence the pound: nutmegs at two pence halfe penie the ounce: ginger
at a penie an ounce, prunes at halfe penie farding: great raisons three
pound for a penie, cinamon at foure pence the ounce, cloues at two
pence, and pepper at twelue, and sixteene pence the pound. Whereby we
may sée the sequele of things not alwaies but verie seldome to be such
as is pretended in the beginning. The wares that they carrie out of the
realme, are for the most part brode clothes and carsies of all colours,
likewise cottons, fréeses, rugs, tin, wooll, our best béere, baies,
bustian, mockadoes tufted and plaine, rash, lead, fells, &amp;c: which being
shipped at sundrie ports of our coasts, are borne from thence into all
quarters of the world, and there either exchanged for other wares or
readie monie: to the great gaine and commoditie of our merchants. And
whereas in times past their cheefe trade was into Spaine, Portingall,
France, Flanders, Danske, Norwaie, Scotland, and Iseland onelie: now in
these daies, as men not contented with these iournies, they haue sought
out the east and west Indies, and made now and then suspicious voiages
not onelie vnto the Canaries, and new Spaine, but likewise into Cathaia,
Moscouia, Tartaria, and the regions thereabout, from whence (as they
saie) they bring home great commodities. But alas I sée not by all their
<span class="page"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[Page 275]</span>
trauell that the prices of things are anie whit abated. Certes this
enormitie (for so I doo accompt of it) was sufficientlie prouided for,
An. 9 Edward 3. by a noble estatute made in that behalfe, but vpon what
occasion the generall execution thereof is staied or not called on, in
good sooth I cannot tell. This onelie I know, that euerie function and
seuerall vocation striueth with other, which of them should haue all the
water of commoditie run into hir owne cesterne.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Yeomen.</span>
Yeomen are those, which by our law are called Legales homines, free men
borne English, and may dispend of their owne free land in yearelie
reuenue, to the summe of fortie shillings sterling, or six pounds as
monie goeth in our times. Some are of the opinion by Cap. 2. Rich. 2.
an. 20. that they are the same which the French men call varlets, but as
that phrase is vsed in my time it is farre vnlikelie to be so. The truth
is that the word is deriued from the Saxon terme Zeoman or Geoman, which
signifieth (as I haue read) a settled or staid man, such I meane as
being maried and of some yeares, betaketh himselfe to staie in the place
of his abode for the better maintenance of himselfe and his familie,
whereof the single sort haue no regard, but are likelie to be still
fleeting now hither now thither, which argueth want of stabilitie in
determination and resolution of iudgement, for the execution of things
of anie importance. This sort of people haue a certeine preheminence,
and more estimation than labourers &amp; the common sort of artificers, &amp;
these commonlie liue wealthilie, kéepe good houses, and trauell to get
riches. They are also for the most part farmers to gentlemen (in old
time called Pagani, &amp; opponuntur militibus, and therfore Persius calleth
himselfe Semipaganus) or at the leastwise artificers, &amp; with grasing,
frequenting of markets, and kéeping of seruants (not idle seruants as
the gentlemen doo, but such as get both their owne and part of their
masters liuing) do come to great welth, in somuch that manie of them are
able and doo buie the lands of vnthriftie gentlemen, and often setting
their sonnes to the schooles, to the vniuersities, and to the Ins of the
court; or otherwise leauing them sufficient lands wherevpon they may
liue without labour, doo make them by those meanes to become gentlemen:
these were they that in times past made all France afraid. And albeit
they be not called master as gentlemen are, or sir as to knights
apperteineth, but onelie Iohn and Thomas, &amp;c: yet haue they beene found
to haue doone verie good seruice: and the kings of
<span class="leftnote">Englishmen on foot and Frenchmen on horssebacke best.</span>
England in foughten battels,
were woont to remaine among them (who were their footmen) as the French
kings did amongst their horssemen: the prince thereby shewing where his
chiefe strength did consist.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote"><em>Capite censi or Proletarij.</em></span>
The fourth and last sort of people in England are daie labourers, poore
husbandmen, and some retailers (which haue no frée land) copie holders,
and all artificers, as tailers, shomakers,
<span class="rightnote">No slaues nor bondmen in England.</span>
carpenters, brickmakers, masons, &amp;c. As for slaues
and bondmen we haue none, naie such is the priuilege of our countrie by
the especiall grace of God, and bountie of our princes, that if anie
come hither from other realms, so soone as they set foot on land they
become so frée of condition as their masters, whereby all note of
seruile bondage is vtterlie remooued from them, wherein we resemble (not
the Germans who had slaues also, though such as in respect of the slaues
of other countries might well be reputed frée, but) the old Indians and
the Taprobanes, who supposed it a great iniurie to nature to make or
suffer them to be bond, whome she in hir woonted course dooth product
and bring foorth frée. This fourth and last sort of people therefore
haue neither voice nor authoritie in the common wealth, but are to be
ruled, and not to rule other: yet they are not altogither neglected, for
in cities and corporat townes, for default of yeomen they are faine to
make up their inquests of such maner of people. And in villages they are
commonlie made churchwardens, sidemen, aleconners, now and then
constables, and manie times inioie the name of hedboroughes. Vnto this
sort also may our great swarmes of idle seruing men be referred, of
whome there runneth a prouerbe; Yoong seruing men old beggers, bicause
seruice is none heritage. These men are profitable to none, for if their
condition be well perused, they are enimies to their masters, to their
freends, and to themselues: for by them oftentimes their masters are
incouraged vnto vnlawfull exactions of their tenants, their fréends
brought vnto pouertie by their rents inhanced, and they themselues
<span class="page"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[Page 276]</span>
brought to confusion by their owne prodigalitie and errors, as men that
hauing not wherewith of their owne to mainteine their excesses, doo
search in high waies, budgets, cofers, males, and stables, which way to
supplie their wants. How diuerse of them also coueting to beare an high
saile doo insinuate themselues with yoong gentlemen and noble men newlie
come to their lands, the case is too much apparant, whereby the good
natures of the parties are not onelie a little impaired, but also their
liuelihoods and reuenues so wasted and consumed, that if at all yet not
in manie yeares they shall be able to recouer themselues. It were verie
good therefore that the superfluous heapes of them were in part
diminished. And sith necessitie inforceth to haue some, yet let wisdome
moderate their numbers, so shall their masters be rid of vnnecessarie
charge, and the common wealth of manie théeues. No nation cherisheth
such store of them as we doo here in England, in hope of which
maintenance manie giue themselues to idlenesse, that otherwise would be
brought to labour, and liue in order like subiects. Of their whoredomes
I will not speake anie thing at all, more than of their swearing, yet is
it found that some of them doo make the first a cheefe piller of their
building, consuming not onelie the goods but also the health &amp; welfare
of manie honest gentlemen, citizens, wealthie yeomen, &amp;c: by such
vnlawfull dealings. But how farre haue I waded in this point, or how
farre may I saile in such a large sea? I will therefore now staie to
speake anie more of those kind of men. In returning therefore to my
matter, this furthermore among other things I haue to saie of our
husbandmen and artificers, that they were neuer so excellent in their
trades as at this present. But as the workemanship of the later sort was
neuer more fine and curious to the eie, so was it neuer lesse strong and
substantiall for continuance and benefit of the buiers. Neither is there
anie thing that hurteth the common sort of our artificers more than
hast, and a barbarous or slauish desire to turne the penie, and by
ridding their worke to make spéedie vtterance of their wares: which
inforceth them to bungle vp and dispatch manie things they care not how
so they be out of their hands, whereby the buier is often sore
defrauded, and findeth to his cost, that hast maketh wast, according to
the prouerbe.</p>

<p>Oh how manie trades and handicrafts are now in England, whereof the
common wealth hath no néed? How manie néedfull commodities haue we which
are perfected with great cost, &amp;c: and yet may with farre more ease and
lesse cost be prouided from other countries if we could vse the meanes.
I will not speake of iron, glasse, and such like, which spoile much
wood, and yet are brought from other countries better chéepe than we can
make them here at home, I could exemplifie also in manie other. But to
leaue these things and procéed with our purpose, and herein (as occasion
serueth) generallie by waie of conclusion to speake of the common-wealth
of England, I find that it is gouerned and mainteined by three sorts of
persons.</p>

<p class="ind">1 The prince, monarch, and head gouernour, which is called the king, or
(if the crowne fall to the woman) the quéene: in whose name and by whose
authoritie all things are administred.</p>

<p class="ind">2 The gentlemen, which be diuided into two sorts, as the baronie or
estate of lords (which conteineth barons and all aboue that degree) and
also those that be no lords, as knights, esquiers, &amp; simple gentlemen,
as I haue noted alreadie. Out of these also are the great deputies and
high presidents chosen, of which one serueth in Ireland, as another did
sometime in Calis, and the capteine now at Berwike; as one lord
president dooth gouerne in Wales, and the other the north parts of this
Iland, which later with certeine councellors and iudges were erected by
king Henrie the eight. But forsomuch as I haue touched their conditions
elsewhere, it shall be inough to haue remembred them at this time.</p>

<p class="ind">3 The third and last sort is named the yeomanrie, of whom &amp; their
sequele, the labourers and artificers, I haue said somewhat euen now.
Whereto I ad that they be not called masters and gentlemen, but goodmen,
as goodman Smith, goodman Coot, goodman Cornell, goodman Mascall,
goodman Cockswet, &amp;c: &amp; in matters of law these and the like are called
thus, Giles lewd-yeoman, Edward Mountford yeoman, Iames Cocke yeoman,
<span class="page"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[Page 277]</span>
Herrie Butcher yeoman, &amp;c: by which addition they are exempt from the
vulgar and common sorts. Cato calleth them Aratores &amp; optimos ciues rei
publicæ, of whom also you may read more in the booke of common wealth
which sir Thomas Smith sometime penned of this land.</p>

<p>Of gentlemen also some are by the prince chosen, and called to great
offices in the common wealth, of which said offices diuerse concerne the
whole realme; some be more priuat and peculiar to the kings house. And
they haue their places and degrées, prescribed by an act of parlement
made An. 31 Henr. octaui, after this maner insuing.</p>

<p>These foure the lord Chancellor, the lord Treasuror (who is Supremus
ærarij Anglici quæstor <em>or</em> Tribunus ærarius maximus) the lord President
of the councell, and the lord Priuie seale, being persons of the degrée
of a baron or aboue, are in the same act appointed to sit in the
parlement and in all assemblies or councell aboue all dukes, not being
of the bloud roiall, Videlicet the kings brother, vncle, or nephue.</p>

<p>And these six, the lord great Chamberleine of England: the lord high
Constable of England: the lord Marshall of England: the lord Admirall of
England: the lord great master or Steward of the kings house: and the
lord Chamberleine: by that act are to be placed in all assemblies of
councell, after the lord priuie seale, according to their degrées and
estats: so that if he be a baron, then he is to sit aboue all barons: or
an earle, aboue all earles.</p>

<p>And so likewise the kings secretarie, being a baron of the parlement,
hath place aboue all barons, and if he be a man of higher degrée, he
shall sit and be placed according therevnto.</p>

<small>OF THE FOOD AND DIET OF THE ENGLISH.</small><br />

CHAP. VI.</h3>

<p>The situation of our region, lieng néere vnto the north, dooth cause the
heate of our stomaches to be of somewhat greater force: therefore our
bodies doo craue a little more ample nourishment, than the inhabitants
of the hotter regions are accustomed withall, whose digestiue force is
not altogither so vehement, bicause their internall heat is not so
strong as ours, which is kept in by the coldnesse of the aire, that from
time to time (speciallie in winter) dooth enuiron our bodies.</p>

<p>It is no maruell therefore that our tables are oftentimes more
plentifullie garnished than those of other nations, and this trade hath
continued with vs euen since the verie beginning. For before the Romans
found out and knew the waie vnto our countrie, our predecessors fed
largelie vpon flesh and milke, whereof there was great aboundance in
this Ile, bicause they applied their chéefe studies vnto pasturage and
féeding. After this maner also did our Welsh Britons order themselues in
<span class="page"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[Page 279]</span>
their diet so long as they liued of themselues, but after they became to
be vnited and made equall with the English they framed their appetites
to liue after our maner, so that at this daie there is verie little
difference betwéene vs in our diets.</p>

<p>In Scotland likewise they haue giuen themselues (of late yeares to
speake of) vnto verie ample and large diet, wherein as for some respect
nature dooth make them equall with vs: so otherwise they far excéed vs
in ouer much and distemperate gormandize, and so ingrosse their bodies
that diuerse of them doo oft become vnapt to anie other purpose than to
spend their times in large tabling and bellie chéere. Against this
pampering of their carcasses dooth Hector Boetius in his description of
the countrie verie sharpelie inueigh in the first chapter of that
treatise. Henrie Wardlaw also bishop of S. Andrewes, noting their
vehement alteration from competent frugalitie into excessiue gluttonie,
to be brought out of England with Iames the first (who had béene long
time prisoner there vnder the fourth &amp; fift Henries, and at his returne
caried diuerse English gentlemen into his countrie with him, whome he
verie honorablie preferred there) dooth vehementlie exclame against the
same in open parlement holden at Perth 1433, before the three estats,
and so bringeth his purpose to passe in the end by force of his learned
persuasions, that a law was presentlie made there for the restreint of
superfluous diet, amongest other things baked meats (dishes neuer before
this mans daies seene in Scotland) were generallie so prouided for by
vertue of this act, that it was not lawfull for anie to eat of the same
vnder the degrée of a gentleman, and those onelie but on high and
festiuall daies, but alas it was soone forgotten.</p>

<p>In old time these north Britons did giue themselues vniuersallie to
great abstinence, and in time of warres their souldiers would often féed
but once or twise at the most in two or thrée daies (especiallie if they
held themselues in secret, or could haue no issue out of their bogges
and marises, through the presence of the enimie) and in this distresse
they vsed to eat a certeine kind of confection, whereof so much as a
beane would qualifie their hunger aboue common expectation. In woods
moreouer they liued with hearbes and rootes, or if these shifts serued
not thorough want of such prouision at hand, then vsed they to créepe
into the water or said moorish plots vp vnto the chins, and there
remaine a long time, onelie to qualifie the heats of their stomachs by
violence, which otherwise would haue wrought and béene readie to
oppresse them for hunger and want of sustinance. In those daies likewise
it was taken for a great offense ouer all, to eat either goose, hare, or
henne, bicause of a certeine superstitious opinion which they had
conceiued of those three creatures, howbeit after that the Romans (I
saie) had once found an entrance into this Iland, it was not long yer
open shipwracke was made of this religious obseruation, so that in
processe of time, so well the north and south Britons as the Romans,
gaue ouer to make such difference in meats, as they had doone before.</p>

<p>From thencefoorth also vnto our daies, and euen in this season wherein
we liue, there is no restreint of anie meat, either for religions sake
or publike order in England, but it is lawfull for euerie man to féed
vpon what soeuer he is able to purchase, except it be vpon those daies
whereon eating of flesh is especiallie forbidden by the lawes of the
realme, which order is taken onelie to the end our numbers of cattell
may be the better increased, &amp; that aboundance of fish which the sea
yéeldeth, more generallie receiued. Beside this there is great
consideration had in making of this law for the preseruation of the
nauie, and maintenance of conuenient numbers of sea faring men, both
which would otherwise greatlie decaie, if some meanes were not found
whereby they might be increased. But how soeuer this case standeth,
white meats, milke, butter &amp; cheese, which were neuer so deere as in my
time, and woont to be accounted of as one of the chiefe staies
throughout the Iland, are now reputed as food appertinent onelie to the
inferiour sort, whilest such as are more wealthie, doo féed vpon the
flesh of all kinds of cattell accustomed to be eaten, all sorts of fish
taken vpon our coasts and in our fresh riuers, and such diuersitie of
wild and tame foules as are either bred in our Iland or brought ouer
vnto vs from other countries of the maine.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[Page 280]</span></p>

<p>In number of dishes and change of meat, the nobilitie of England (whose
cookes are for the most part musicall headed Frenchmen and strangers)
doo most exceed, sith there is no daie in maner that passeth ouer their
heads, wherein they haue not onelie béefe, mutton, veale, lambe, kid,
porke, conie, capon, pig, or so manie of these as the season yeeldeth:
but also some portion of the red or fallow déere, beside great varietie
of fish and wild foule, and thereto sundrie other delicates wherein the
swéet hand of the seafaring Portingale is not wanting: so that for a man
to dine with one of them, and to tast of euerie dish that standeth
before him (which few vse to doo, but ech one feedeth vpon that meat him
best liketh for the time, the beginning of euerie dish notwithstanding
being reserued vnto the greatest personage that sitteth at the table, to
whome it is drawen vp still by the waiters as order requireth, and from
whome it descendeth againe euen to the lower end, whereby each one may
tast thereof) is rather to yéeld vnto a conspiracie with a great deale
of meat for the spéedie suppression of naturall health, then the vse of
a necessarie meane to satisfie himselfe with a competent repast, to
susteine his bodie withall. But as this large feeding is not séene in
their gests, no more is it in their owne persons, for sith they haue
dailie much resort vnto their tables (and manie times vnlooked for) and
thereto reteine great numbers of seruants, it is verie requisit &amp;
expedient for them to be somewhat plentifull in this behalfe.</p>

<p>The chiefe part likewise of their dailie prouision is brought in before
them (commonlie in siluer vessell if they be of the degrée of barons,
bishops and vpwards) and placed on their tables, wherof when they haue
taken what it pleaseth them, the rest is reserued, and afterward sent
downe to their seruing men and waiters, who féed thereon in like sort
with conuenient moderation, their reuersion also being bestowed vpon the
poore, which lie readie at their gates in great numbers to receiue the
same. This is spoken of the principall tables whereat the nobleman, his
ladie and guestes are accustomed to sit, beside which they haue a
certeine ordinarie allowance dailie appointed for their hals, where the
chiefe officers and household seruants (for all are not permitted by
custome to waite vpon their master) and with them such inferiour guestes
doo féed as are not of calling to associat the noble man himselfe (so
that besides those afore mentioned, which are called to the principall
table, there are commonlie fortie or thrée score persons fed in those
hals, to the great reliefe of such poore sutors and strangers also as
oft be partakers thereof and otherwise like to dine hardlie. As for
drinke it is vsuallie filled in pots, gobblets, iugs, bols of siluer in
noble mens houses, also in fine Venice glasses of all formes, and for
want of these elsewhere in pots of earth of sundrie colours and moulds
whereof manie are garnished with siluer) or at the leastwise in pewter,
all which notwithstanding are seldome set on the table, but each one as
necessitie vrgeth, calleth for a cup of such drinke as him listeth to
haue: so that when he hath tasted of it he deliuered the cup againe to
some one of the standers by, who making it cleane by pouring out the
drinke that remaineth, restoreth it to the cupbord from whence he
fetched the same. By this deuise (a thing brought vp at the first by
Mnesteus of Athens, in conseruation of the honour of Orestes, who had
not yet made expiation for the death of his adulterous parents Egistus
and Clitemnestra) much idle tippling is furthermore cut off, for if the
full pots should continuallie stand at the elbow or néere the trencher,
diuerse would alwaies be dealing with them, whereas now they drinke
seldome and onelie when necessitie vrgeth, and so auoid the note of
great drinking, or often troubling of the seruitours with filling of
their bols. Neuerthelesse in the noble mens hals, this order is not
vsed, neither in anie mans house commonlie vnder the degrée of a knight
or esquire of great reuenues. It is a world to sée in these our daies,
wherin gold and siluer most aboundeth, how that our gentilitie as
lothing those mettals (bicause of the plentie) do now generallie choose
rather the Venice glasses both for our wine and béere, than anie of
those mettals or stone wherein before time we haue béene accustomed to
drinke, but such is the nature of man generallie that it most coueteth
things difficult to be atteined; &amp; such is the estimation of this
stuffe, that manie become rich onelie with their new trade vnto Murana
(a towne néere to Venice situat on the Adriatike sea) from whence the
verie best are dailie to be had, and such as for beautie doo well néere
<span class="page"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[Page 281]</span>
match the christall or the ancient Murrhina vasa, whereof now no man
hath knowledge. And as this is séene in the gentilitie, so in the
wealthie communaltie the like desire of glasse is not neglected, whereby
the gaine gotten by their purchase is yet much more increased to the
benefit of the merchant. The poorest also will haue glasse if they may,
but sith the Venecian is somewhat too déere for them, they content
themselues with such as are made at home of ferne and burned stone, but
in fine all go one waie, that is, to shards at the last, so that our
great expenses in glasses (beside that they bréed much strife toward
such as haue the charge of them) are worst of all bestowed in mine
opinion, bicause their péeces doo turne vnto no profit. If the
<span class="leftnote">Ro. Bacon.</span>
philosophers stone were once found, and one part hereof mixed with
fortie of molten glasse, it would induce such a mettallicall toughnesse
therevnto, that a fall should nothing hurt it in such maner, yet it
might peraduenture bunch or batter it, neuerthelesse that inconuenience
were quickelie to be redressed by the hammer. But whither am I slipped?</p>

<p>The gentlemen and merchants keepe much about one rate, and each of them
contenteth himselfe with foure, fiue, or six dishes, when they haue but
small resort, or peraduenture with one, or two, or thrée at the most,
when they haue no strangers to accompanie them at their tables. And yet
their seruants haue their ordinarie diet assigned, beside such as is
left at their masters boordes, &amp; not appointed to be brought thither the
second time, which neuerthelesse is often séene generallie in venison,
lambe, or some especiall dish, whereon the merchant man himselfe liketh
to feed when it is cold, or peraduenture for sundrie causes incident to
the féeder is better so, than if it were warme or hot. To be short, at
such time as the merchants doo make their ordinarie or voluntarie
feasts, it is a world to see what great prouision is made of all maner
of delicat meats, from euerie quarter of the countrie, wherein beside
that they are often comparable herein to the nobilitie of the land, they
will seldome regard anie thing that the butcher vsuallie killeth, but
reiect the same as not worthie to come in place. In such cases also
geliffes of all colours mixed with a varietie in the representation of
sundrie floures, herbs, trees, formes of beasts, fish, foules and
fruits, and therevnto marchpaine wrought with no small curiositie, tarts
of diuerse hewes and sundrie denominations, conserues of old fruits
forren and home-bred, suckets, codinacs, marmilats, marchpaine,
sugerbread, gingerbread, florentines, wild foule, venison of all sorts,
and sundrie outlandish confections, altogether seasoned with suger
(which Plinie calleth Mel ex arundinibus, a deuise not common nor
greatlie vsed in old time at the table, but onelie in medicine, although
it grew in Arabia, India &amp; Sicilia) doo generallie beare the swaie,
besides infinit deuises of our owne not possible for me to remember. Of
the potato and such venerous roots as are brought out of Spaine,
Portingale, and the Indies to furnish vp our bankets, I speake not,
wherin our Mures of no lesse force, and to be had about Crosbie
Rauenswath, doo now begin to haue place.</p>

<p>But among all these, the kind of meat which is obteined with most
difficultie and cost, is commonlie taken for the most delicat, and
therevpon each guest will soonest desire to feed. And as all estats doo
excéed herin, I meane for strangenesse and number of costlie dishes, so
these forget not to vse the like excesse in wine, in somuch as there is
no kind to be had (neither anie where more store of all sorts than in
England, although we haue none growing with vs but yearelie to the
proportion of 20000 or 30000 tun and vpwards, notwithstanding the dailie
restreincts of the same brought ouer vnto vs) wherof at great méetings
there is not some store to be had. Neither doo I meane this of small
wines onlie, as Claret, White, Red, French, &amp;c: which amount to about
fiftie six sorts, according to the number of regions from whence they
come: but also of the thirtie kinds of Italian, Grecian, Spanish,
Canarian, &amp;c: whereof Veruage, Cate pument, Raspis, Muscadell, Romnie,
Bastard Tire, Oseie, Caprike, Clareie &amp; Malmeseie are not least of all
accompted of, bicause of their strength and valure. For as I haue said
in meat, so the stronger the wine is, the more it is desired, by means
wherof in old time, the best was called Theologicum, bicause it was had
from the cleargie and religious men, vnto whose houses manie of the
laitie would often send for bottels filled with the same, being sure
that they would neither drinke nor be serued of the worst, or such as
<span class="page"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[Page 282]</span>
was anie waies mingled or brued by the vintener: naie the merchant would
haue thought that his soule should haue gone streightwaie to the diuell,
if he should haue serued them with other than the best. Furthermore when
these haue had their course which nature yéeldeth, sundrie sorts of
artificiall stuffe, as ypocras &amp; wormewood wine must in like maner
succéed in their turnes, beside stale ale and strong béere, which
neuerthelesse beare the greatest brunt in drinking, and are of so manie
sorts and ages as it pleaseth the bruer to make them.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Béere.</span>
The béere that is vsed at noble mens tables in their fixed and standing
houses, is commonlie of a yeare old, or peraduenture of two yeares
tunning or more, but this is not generall. It is also brued in March and
therefore called March béere, but for the household it is vsuallie not
vnder a moneths age, ech one coueting to haue the same stale as he may,
so that it be not sowre, and his bread new as is possible so that it be
not hot.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Artificer.</span>
The artificer and husbandman make greatest accompt of such meat as they
may soonest come by, and haue it quickliest readie, except it be in
London when the companies of euery trade doo meet on their quarter
daies, at which time they be nothing inferiour to the nobilitie. Their
food also consisteth principallie in béefe and such meat as the butcher
selleth, that is to saie, mutton, veale, lambe, porke, &amp;c: whereof he
findeth great store in the markets adioining, beside souse, brawne,
bacon, fruit, pies of fruit, foules of sundrie sorts, cheese, butter,
egs, &amp;c: as the other wanteth it not at home, by his owne prouision,
which is at the best hand, and commonlie least charge. In feasting also
this latter sort, I meane the husbandmen doo excéed after their maner:
especiallie at bridales, purifications of women, and such od méetings,
where it is incredible to tell what meat is consumed &amp; spent, ech one
bringing such a dish, or so manie with him as his wife &amp; he doo consult
vpon, but alwaies with this consideration, that the léefer fréend shall
haue the better prouision. This also is commonlie séene at these
bankets, that the good man of the house is not charged with any thing
sauing bread, drink, sauce, houseroome, and fire. But the artificers in
cities and good townes doo deale far otherwise, for albeit that some of
them doo suffer their iawes to go oft before their clawes, and diuerse
of them by making good cheere doo hinder themselues and other men: yet
the wiser sort can handle the matter well inough in these iunkettings,
and therfore their frugalitie deserueth commendation. To conclude, both
the artificer and the husbandman are sufficientlie liberall, &amp; verie
fréendlie at their tables, and when they méet, they are so merie without
malice, and plaine without inward Italian or French craft and subtiltie,
that it would doo a man good to be in companie among them. Herein onelie
are the inferiour sort somewhat to be blamed, that being thus assembled,
their talke is now and then such as <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'savoureth'">sauoureth</ins> of scurrilitie and
ribaldrie, a thing naturallie incident to carters and clownes, who
thinke themselues not to be merie &amp; welcome, if their foolish veines in
this behalfe be neuer so little restreined. This is moreouer to be added
in these méetings, that if they happen to stumble vpon a péece of
venison, and a cup of wine or verie strong beere or ale (which latter
they commonlie prouide against their appointed daies) they thinke their
<span class="leftnote">I haue dined so well as my lord maior.</span>
chéere so great, and themselues to haue fared so well, as the lord Maior
of London, with whome when their bellies be full they will not often
sticke to make comparison, because that of a subiect there is no publike
officer of anie citie in Europe, that may compare in port and
countenance with him during the time of his office.</p>

<p>I might here talke somewhat of the great silence that is vsed at the
tables of the honorable and wiser sort, generallie ouer all the realme
(albeit that too much deserueth no c&#333;mendation, for it belongeth to
gests neither to be muti nor loquaces) likewise of the moderate eating
and drinking that is dailie séene, and finallie of the regard that each
one hath to keepe himselfe from the note of surffetting and dronkennesse
(for which cause salt meat, except béefe, bacon, and porke are not anie
whit esteemed, and yet these thrée may not be much powdered) but as in
rehearsall thereof I should commend the noble man, merchant, and frugall
artificer, so I could not cleare the meaner sort of husbandmen, and
countrie inhabitants of verie much babbling (except it be here and there
some od yeoman) with whome he is thought to be the meriest that talketh
<span class="page"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[Page 283]</span>
of most ribaldrie, or the wisest man that speaketh fastest among them, &amp;
now and then surffetting and dronkennesse, which they rather fall into
for want of héed taking, than wilfullie following or delighting in those
errours of set mind and purpose. It may be that diuers of them liuing at
home with hard and pinching diet, small drinke, and some of them hauing
scarse inough of that, are soonest ouertaken when they come vnto such
bankets, howbeit they take it generallie as no small disgrace if they
happen to be cupshotten, so that it is a greefe vnto them though now
sans remedie sith the thing is doone and past. If the freends also of
the wealthier sort come to their houses from farre, they are commonlie
so welcome till they depart as vpon the first daie of their comming,
wheras in good townes and cities, as London, &amp;c: men oftentimes
complaine of little roome, and in reward of a fat capon or plentie of
béefe and mutton, largelie bestowed vpon them in the countrie, a cup of
wine or béere with a napkin to wipe their lips, and an "You are
heartelie welcome" is thought to be great interteinement, and therefore
the old countrie clearkes haue framed this saieng in that behalfe, I
meane vpon the interteinment of townesmens and Londoners after the daies
of their aboad in this maner:</p>

<p class="ind1">Primus iucundus, tollerabilis estq; secundus,<br />
Tertius est vanus, sed fetet quatriduanus.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bread.</span>
The bread through out the land is made of such graine as the soile
yéeldeth, neuerthelesse the gentilitie commonlie prouide themselues
sufficientlie of wheat for their owne tables, whilest their household
and poore neighbours in some shires are inforced to content themselues
with rie, or barleie, yea and in time of dearth manie with bread made
either of beans, peason, or otes, or of altogither and some acornes
among, of which scourge the poorest doo soonest tast, sith they are
least able to prouide themselues of better. I will not saie that this
extremitie is oft so well to be seene in time of plentie as of dearth,
but if I should I could easilie bring my triall. For albeit that there
be much more ground eared now almost in euerie place, than hath beene of
late yeares, yet such a price of corne continueth in each towne and
market without any iust cause (except it be that landlords doo get
licences to carie corne out of the land onelie to kéepe vp the peeces
for their owne priuate gaines and ruine of the common-wealth) that the
artificer and poore laboring man, is not able to reach vnto it, but
<span class="leftnote">A famine at hand is first séene in the horsse manger
when the poore doo fall to horssecorne.</span>
is driuen to content himselfe with horsse-corne, I meane, beanes,
peason, otes, tares, and lintels: and therefore it is a true prouerbe,
and neuer so well verified as now, that hunger setteth his first foot
into the horsse manger. If the world last a while after this rate,
wheate and rie will be no graine for poore men to feed on, and some
caterpillers there are that can saie so much alreadie.</p>

<p>Of bread made of wheat we haue sundrie sorts, dailie brought to the
table, whereof the first and most excellent is the mainchet, which we
<span class="leftnote">Primarius panis.</span>
commonlie call white bread, in Latine Primarius panis, wherof Budeus
also speaketh, in his first booke De asse, and our good workemen deliuer
commonlie such proportion, that of the flower of one bushell with
another they make fortie cast of manchet, of which euerie lofe weigheth
eight ounces into the ouen and six ounces out, as I haue béene informed.
<span class="leftnote">Cheat bread.</span>
The second is the cheat or wheaton bread, so named bicause the colour
therof resembleth the graie or yellowish wheat, being cleane and well
dressed, and out of this is the coursest of the bran (vsuallie called
<span class="leftnote">Rauelled bread.</span>
gurgeons or pollard) taken. The raueled is a kind of cheat bread also,
but it reteineth more of the grosse, and lesse of the pure substance of
the wheat: and this being more sleightlie wrought vp, is vsed in the
halles of the nobilitie, and gentrie onelie, whereas the other either is
<span class="leftnote">The size of bread is verie ill kept or not at all
looked vnto in the countrie townes and markets.</span>
or should be baked in cities &amp; good townes of an appointed size
(according to such price as the corne dooth beare) and by a statute
prouided by king Iohn in that behalfe. The raueled cheat therfore is
generallie so made that out of one bushell of meale, after two and
twentie pounds of bran be sifted and taken from it (wherevnto they ad
the gurgeons that rise from the manchet) they make thirtie cast, euerie
lofe weighing eightéene ounces into the ouen and sixteene ounces out:
and beside this they so handle the matter that to euerie bushell of
<span class="page"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[Page 284]</span>
meale they ad onelie two and twentie or thrée and twentie pound of
water, washing also in some houses there corne before it go to the mill,
whereby their manchet bread is more excellent in colour and pleasing to
<span class="leftnote">Browne bread.</span>
the eie, than otherwise it would be. The next sort is named browne bread
of the colour, of which we haue two sorts, one baked vp as it c&#333;meth
from the mill, so that neither the bran nor the floure are anie whit
diminished, this Celsus called Autopirus panis, lib. 2. and putteth it
in the second place of nourishment. The other hath little or no floure
<span class="leftnote">Panis Cibarius.</span>
left therein at all, howbeit he calleth it Panem Cibarium, and it is not
onlie the woorst and weakest of all the other sorts, but also appointed
in old time for seruants, slaues, and the inferiour kind of people to
féed vpon. Herevnto likewise, bicause it is drie and brickie in the
working (for it will hardlie be made vp handsomelie into loaues) some
adde a portion of rie meale in our time, whereby the rough drinesse or
drie roughnes therof is somwhat qualified, &amp; then it is named miscelin,
that is, bread made of mingled corne, albeit that diuerse doo sow or
mingle wheat &amp; rie of set purpose at the mill, or before it come there,
and sell the same at the markets vnder the aforesaid name.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Summer wheat and winter barleie verie rare in England.</span>
In champeigne countries much rie and barleie bread is eaten, but
especiallie where wheat is scant and geson. As for the difference that
is betwéene the summer and winter wheat, most husbandmen know it not,
sith they are neither acquainted with summer wheat, nor winter barleie:
yet here and there I find of both sorts, speciallie in the north and
about Kendall, where they call it March wheat, and also of summer rie,
but in so small quantities as that I dare not pronounce them to be
greatlie common among vs.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Drinke.</span>
Our drinke, whose force and continuance is partlie touched alreadie, is
made of barleie, water, and hops, sodden and mingled togither, by the
industrie of our bruers, in a certeine exact proportion. But before our
barleie doo come vnto their hands, it susteineth great alteration, and
<span class="leftnote">Malt.</span>
is conuerted into malt, the making whereof, I will here set downe in
such order, as my skill therein may extend vnto (for I am scarse a good
malster) chiefelie for that forreine writers haue attempted to describe
the same, and the making of our beere, wherein they haue shot so farre
wide, as the quantitie of ground was betwéene themselues &amp; their marke.
In the meane time beare with me, gentle reader (I beséech thée) that
lead thee from the description of the plentifull diet of our countrie,
vnto the fond report of a seruile trade, or rather from a table
delicatelie furnished, into a mustie malthouse: but such is now thy hap,
wherfore I praie thée be contented.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Making of malt.</span>
Our malt is made all the yeare long in some great townes, but in
gentlemens and yeomens houses, who commonlie make sufficient for their
owne expenses onelie, the winter halfe is thought most méet for that
commoditie: howbeit the malt that is made when the willow dooth bud, is
commonlie worst of all, neuerthelesse each one indeuoureth to make it of
the best barleie, which is steeped in a cesterne, in greater or less
quantitie, by the space of thrée daies and three nights, vntill it be
throughlie soked. This being doone, the water is drained from it by
little and little, till it be quite gone. Afterward they take it out,
and laieng it vpon the cleane floore on a round heape, it resteth so
vntill it be readie to shoote at the root end, which maltsters call
Comming. When it beginneth therefore to shoot in this maner, they saie
it is come, and then foorthwith they spread it abroad, first thicke, and
afterward thinner and thinner vpon the said floore (as it commeth) and
there it lieth (with turning euerie daie foure or fiue times) by the
space of one and twentie daies at the least, the workeman not suffering
it in anie wise to take anie heat, whereby the bud end should spire,
that bringeth foorth the blade, and by which ouersight or hurt of the
stuffe it selfe the malt would be spoiled, and turne small commoditie to
the bruer. When it hath gone or béene turned so long vpon the floore,
they carie it to a kill couered with haire cloth, where they giue it
gentle heats (after they haue spread it there verie thin abroad) till it
be drie, &amp; in the meane while they turne it often, that it may be
vniformelie dried. For the more it be dried (yet must it be doone with
soft fire) the swéeter and better the malt is, and the longer it will
continue, whereas if it be not dried downe (as they call it) but
slackelie handled, it will bréed a kind of worme, called a wiuell, which
groweth in the floure of the corne, and in processe of time will so eat
<span class="page"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[Page 285]</span>
out it selfe, that nothing shall remaine of the graine but euen the
verie rind or huske.</p>

<p>The best malt is tried by the hardnesse &amp; colour, for if it looke fresh
with a yellow hew, &amp; thereto will write like a péece of chalke, after
you haue bitten a kirnell in sunder in the middest, then you may assure
your selfe that it is dried downe. In some places it is dried at leisure
with wood alone, or strawe alone, in other with wood and strawe
togither, but of all the strawe dried, is the most excellent. For the
wood dried malt when it is brued, beside that the drinke is higher of
colour, it dooth hurt and annoie the head of him that is not vsed
thereto, bicause of the smoake. Such also as vse both indifferentlie doo
barke, cleaue, and drie their wood in an ouen, thereby to remooue all
moisture that shuld procure the fume, and this malt is in the second
place, &amp; with the same likewise, that which is made with dried firze,
broome, &amp;c: whereas if they also be occupied gréene, they are in maner
so preiudiciall to the corne, as is the moist wood. And thus much of our
malts, in bruing whereof some grinde the same somewhat groselie, and in
séething well the liquor that shall be put vnto it, they adde to euerie
nine quarters of mault one of headcorne, which consisteth of sundrie
graine, as wheate, and otes groond. But what haue I to doo with this
matter, or rather so great a quantitie, wherewith I am not acquainted.
Neuerthelesse, sith I haue taken occasion to speake of bruing, I will
exemplifie in such a proportion as I am best skilled in, bicause it is
the vsuall rate for mine owne familie, and once in a moneth practised by
my wife &amp; hir maid seruants, who procéed withall after this maner, as
she hath oft informed me.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bruing of beere.</span>
Hauing therefore groond eight bushels of good malt vpon our querne,
where the toll is saued, she addeth vnto it halfe a bushell of wheat
meale, and so much of otes small groond, and so tempereth or mixeth them
with the malt, that you cannot easilie discerne the one from the other,
otherwise these later would clunter, fall into lumps, and thereby become
vnprofitable. The first liquor which is full eightie gallons, according
to the proportion of our furnace, she maketh boiling hot, and then
powreth it softlie into the malt, where it resteth (but without
stirring) vntill hir second liquor be almost readie to boile. This doone
she letteth hir mash run till the malt be left without liquor, or at the
leastwise the greatest part of the moisture, which she perceiueth by the
staie and soft issue thereof, and by this time hir second liquor in the
furnace is ready to séeth, which is put also to the malt as the first
woort also againe into the furnace wherevnto she addeth two pounds of
the best English hops, and so letteth them seeth togither by the space
of two houres in summer, or an houre and an halfe in winter, whereby it
getteth an excellent colour, and continuance without impeachment, or
<span class="leftnote">Charwoort.</span>
anie superfluous tartnesse. But before she putteth hir first woort into
the furnace, or mingleth it with the hops, she taketh out a vessel full,
of eight or nine gallons, which she shutteth vp close, and suffereth no
aire to come into it till it become yellow, and this she reserueth by it
selfe vnto further vse, as shall appeare herafter, calling it Brackwoort
or Charwoort, and as she saith it addeth also to the colour of the
drinke, whereby it yeeldeth not vnto amber or fine gold in hew vnto the
eie. By this time also hir second woort is let runne, and the first
being taken out of the furnace and placed to coole, she returneth the
middle woort vnto the furnace, where it is striken ouer, or from whence
it is taken againe, when it beginneth to boile and mashed the second
time, whilest the third liquor is heat (for there are thrée liquors) and
this last put into the furnace, when the second is mashed againe. When
she hath mashed also the last liquor (and set the second to coole by the
first) she letteth it runne, and then séetheth it againe with a pound
and an halfe of new hops, or peraduenture two pounds as she séeth cause
by the goodnesse or basenesse of the hops, &amp; when it hath sodden in
summer two houres &amp; in winter an houre &amp; an halfe, she striketh it also
and reserueth it vnto mixture with the rest when time dooth serue
therefore. Finallie when she setteth hir drinke togither, she addeth to
hir brackwoort or charwoort halfe an ounce of arras, and halfe a
quarterne of an ounce of baiberries finelie powdered, and then putting
the same into hir woort with an handfull of wheat flowre, she procéedeth
<span class="page"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[Page 286]</span>
in such vsuall order as common bruing requireth. Some in stéed of arras
&amp; baies adde so much long pepper onelie, but in hir opinion and my
liking it is not so good as the first, and hereof we make thrée
hoggesheads of good beere, such (I meane) as is méet for poore men as I
am to liue withall, whose small maintenance (for what great thing is
fortie pounds a yeare Computatis computandis able to performe) may
indure no déeper cut, the charges whereof groweth in this manner. I
value my malt at ten shillings, my wood at foure shillings which I buie,
my hops at twentie pence, the spice at two pence, seruants wages two
shillings six pence with meat and drinke, and the wearing of my vessell
at twentie pence, so that for my twentie shillings I haue ten score
gallons of béere or more, notwithstanding the losse in seething, which
some being loth to forgo doo not obserue the time, and therefore spéed
thereafter in their successe, and worthilie. The continuance of the
drinke is alwaie determined after the quantitie of the hops, so that
being well hopped it lasteth longer. For it féedeth vpon the hop, and
holdeth out so long as the force of the same continueth, which being
extinguished the drinke must be spent or else it dieth, and becommeth of
no value.</p>

<p>In this trade also our bruers obserue verie diligentlie the nature of
the water, which they dailie occupie; and soile through which it
passeth, for all waters are not of like goodnesse, sith the fattest
standing water is alwaies the best: for although the waters that run by
chalke or cledgie soiles be good, and next vnto the Thames water which
is the most excellent, yet the water that standeth in either of these is
the best for vs that dwell in the countrie, as whereon the sunne lieth
longest, and fattest fish is bred. But of all other the fennie and
morish is the worst, and the cléerest spring water next vnto it. In this
busines therfore the skilfull workeman dooth redeeme the iniquitie of
that element, by changing of his proportions, which trouble in ale
(sometime our onelie, but now taken with manie for old and sickmens
drinke) is neuer séene nor heard of. Howbeit as the beere well sodden in
the bruing, and stale, is cleere and well coloured as muscadell or
malueseie, or rather yellow as the gold noble as our potknights call it:
so our ale which is not at all or verie little sodden, and without hops,
is more thicke, fulsome, and of no such continuance, which are thrée
notable things to be considered in that liquor. But what for that?
Certes I know some aleknights so much addicted therevnto, that they will
not ceasse from morow vntill euen to visit the same, clensing house
after house, till they defile themselues, and either fall quite vnder
the boord, or else not daring to stirre from their stooles, sit still
pinking with their narrow eies as halfe sleeping, till the fume of their
aduersarie be digested that he may go to it afresh. Such flights also
haue the alewiues for the vtterance of this drinke, that they will mixe
it with rosen and salt: but if you heat a knife red hot, and quench it
in the ale so neere the bottome of the pot as you can put it, you shall
sée the rosen come foorth hanging on the knife. As for the force of
salt, it is well knowne by the effect, for the more the drinker tipleth,
the more he may, and so dooth he carrie off a drie dronken noll to bed
with him, except his lucke be the better. But to my purpose.</p>

<p>In some places of England, there is a kind of drinke made of apples,
<span class="leftnote">Cider.<br />
Perrie.</span>
which they call cider or pomage, but that of peares is named pirrie, and
both are groond and pressed in presses made for the nonce. Certes these
two are verie common in Sussex, Kent, Worcester, and other stéeds, where
these sorts of fruits doo abound, howbeit they are not their onelie
drinke at all times, but referred vnto the delicate sorts of drinke, as
<span class="leftnote">Metheglin.</span>
metheglin is in Wales, whereof the Welshmen make no lesse accompt (and
not without cause if it be well handled) than the Gréekes did of their
Ambrosia or Nectar, which for the pleasantnesse thereof, was supposed to
be such as the gods themselues did delite in. There is a kind of swish
swash made also in Essex, and diuerse other places, with honicombs and
water, which the homelie countrie wiues, putting some pepper and a
<span class="leftnote">Mead.</span>
little other spice among, call mead, verie good in mine opinion for such
as loue to be loose bodied at large, or a little eased of the cough,
otherwise it differeth so much fr&#333; the true metheglin, as chalke from
cheese. Truelie it is nothing else but the washing of the combes, when
the honie is wroong out, and one of the best things that I know
<span class="leftnote">Hydromel.</span>
belonging thereto is, that they spend but little labour and lesse cost in
<span class="page"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[Page 287]</span>
making of the same, and therefore no great losse if it were neuer
occupied. Hitherto of the diet of my countrimen, &amp; somewhat more at
large peraduenture than manie men will like of, wherefore I thinke good
now to finish this tractation, and so will I, when I haue added a few
other things incident vnto that which goeth before, whereby the whole
processe of the same shall fullie be deliuered, &amp; my promise to my
fréend in this behalfe performed.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Lesse time spent in eating than heretofore.</span>
Heretofore there hath béene much more time spent in eating and drinking
than commonlie is in these daies, for whereas of old we had breakefasts
in the forenoone, beuerages, or nuntions after dinner, and thereto reare
suppers generallie when it was time to go to rest (a toie brought into
England by hardie Canutus and a custome whereof Athenæus also speaketh
lib. 1, albeit Hippocrates speake but of twise at the most lib. 2. De
rat. vict. in feb. ac.) Now these od repasts thanked be God are verie
well left, and ech one in maner (except here and there some yoong
hungrie stomach that cannot fast till dinner time) contenteth himselfe
with dinner &amp; supper onelie. The Normans misliking the gormandise of
Canutus, ordeined after their arriuall, that no table should be couered
aboue once in the daie, which Huntingdon imputeth to their auarice: but
in the end either waxing wearie of their owne frugalitie, or suffering
the cockle of old custome to ouergrow the good corne of their new
constitution, they fell to such libertie, that in often féeding they
<span class="leftnote">Canutus a glutton, but the Normans at the last
excéeded him in that vice.</span>
surmounted Canutus surnamed the hardie. For whereas he couered his table
but thrée or foure times in the daie, these spred their clothes fiue or
six times, and in such wise as I before rehearsed. They brought in also
the custome of long and statelie sitting at meat, whereby their feasts
resembled those ancient pontificall bankets whereof Macrobius speaketh
lib. 3. cap. 13. and Plin. lib. 10. cap. 10. and which for
sumptuousnesse of fare, long sitting and curiositie shewed in the same,
excéeded all other mens feasting, which fondnesse is not yet left with
vs, notwithstanding that it proueth verie beneficiall for the
physicians, who most abound, where most excesse and misgouernement of
our bodies doo appéere, although it be a great expense of time, and
worthie of reprehension. For the nobilitie, gentlemen, and merchantmen,
<span class="leftnote">Long sitting reprehended.</span>
especiallie at great méetings doo sit commonlie till two or three of the
clocke at afternoone, so that with manie is an hard matter, to rise from
the table to go to euening praier, and returne from thence to come time
inough to supper. For my part I am persuaded that the purpose of the
Normans at the first was to reduce the ancient Roman order or Danish
custome in féeding once in the daie, and toward the euening, as I haue
red and noted. And indéed the Romans had such a custome, and likewise
the Grecians, as may appeere by the words of Socrates, who said vnto the
Atheniens, "Oriente sole consilium, occidente conuiuium est cogitandum,"
although a little something was allowed in the morning to yoong children
which we now <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'calla breakefast'">call a breakefast</ins>. Plato called the Siciliens monsters, for
that they vsed to eat twise in the daie. Among the Persians onelie the
king dined when the sunne was at the highest, and shadow of the stile at
the shortest: the rest (as it is reported) went alwaies but once to meat
when their stomachs craued it, as the Canariens and Indians doo in my
time (who if appetite serue refuse not to go to meat at anie houre of
the night) and likewise the ancient Caspians. Yet Arhianus noteth it as
a rare thing li. 4. cap. 16. that the Tyrhenians had taken vp an ill
custome to féed twise in a daie. Howbeit at the last they fell
generallie to allow of suppers toward the setting of the sunne in all
places, bicause they would haue their whole familie to go to meat
togither, and wherevnto they would appoint their guests to come at a
certeine length of the shadow, to be perceiued in their dials. And this
is more to be noted of antiquitie, that if anie man (as Plutarch saith)
did féed before that time, he incurred a note of reprehension as if he
had beene gluttonous and giuen vnto the bellie, 8. Sympos. 6. Their
slaues in like sort were glad, when it grew to the tenth foot, for then
were they sure soone after to go to meat. In the scripture we read of
manie suppers &amp; few dinners, onelie for that dining was not greatlie
vsed in Christs time, but taken as a thing latelie sproong vp, when
pampering of the bellie began to take hold, occasioned by idlenes and
great abundance of riches. It is pretie to note in Iuuenal, how he
<span class="rightnote">* That is at thrée of the clocke at afternoone.</span>
taunteth Marius for that he gaue himselfe to drinke before the *ninth
<span class="page"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[Page 288]</span>
houre of the daie: for thinking three houres to be too little for the
filling of his bellie, he began commonlie at eight, which was an houre
too soone. Afterwards when gurmandise increased yet more amongst the
Romans, and from them was dispersed vnto all nations vnder their
subiection, it came to passe that six houres onlie were appointed to
worke and consult in, and the other six of the daie to feed and drinke
in, as the verse saith:</p>

<p class="ind1">Sex horæ tantùm rebus tribuantur agendis,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viuere post illas, littera Zetha monet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wherevnto Maximus Planudes (except my memorie faile me) addeth this
scholie after his maner, saieng that from morning vnto noone (which is
six of the clocke after the vnequall accompt) each one dooth trauell
about his necessarie affaires, that being doone, he betaketh himselfe to
the refreshing of his bodie, which is noted and set downe by the Gréeke
letters of the diall (wherewith the Romane horologies were marked, as
ours be with their numerall letters) whereby the time is described; for
those which point 7, 8, 9 and 10 are written with <ins title="Greek: x ê th i">&xi; &eta; &theta; &iota;</ins> and
being ioined yéeld <ins title="Greek: xêthi">&xi;&eta;&theta;&iota;</ins>, which in English signified so much as
liue, as if they should meane, eat that thou maist liue. But how Martial
diuided his daie, and with him the whole troope of the learned &amp; wiser
sort, these verses following doo more euidentlie declare:<br /><span class="leftnote">Li. 4. epig. 8.</span></p>

<p class="ind1a">Prima salutantes, atque altera continet horas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercet raucos tertia causidicos.<br />
In quintam varios extendit Roma labores,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexta quies lassis, septima finis erit.<br />
Sufficit in nonam nitidis octaua palestris,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperat extructos frangere nona thoros.<br />
Hora libellorum decima est Eupheme meorum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperat Ambrosias cum tua cura dapes.<br />
Et bonus æthereo laxatur Nectare Cæsar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingentíque tenet pocula parca manu.<br />
Tunc admitte iocos: gressu timet ire licenti,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ad matutinum nostra Thaleia Iouem.</p>

<p>Thus we sée how the ancient maner of the Gentils was to féed but once in
the daie, and that toward night, till gluttonie grew on and altered this
good custome. I might here remember also their maner in pulling off
their shooes when they sat downe to meat, whereof Martial saith:</p>

<p class="ind1">Deposui soleas, affertur protinus ingens<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inter lactucas oxygarmúq; liber, &amp;c.</p>

<p>And Tullie also remembreth where he saith Seruum à pedibus ad te misi,
which office grew of the said custome, as Seruus ad limina did of
kéeping the doore, though in most houses both these were commonlie one
mans office, also Ad pocula of attending on the cup. But bicause the
good writers of our time haue obserued these phrases and such like with
their causes and descriptions, in their infinite and seuerall treatises,
I shall not need to discourse anie farther vpon them. With vs the
nobilitie, gentrie, and students, doo ordinarilie go to dinner at eleuen
before noone, and to supper at fiue, or betweene fiue and six at
afternoone. The merchants dine and sup seldome before twelue at noone,
and six at night especiallie in London. The husbandmen dine also at high
noone as they call it, and sup at seuen or eight: but out of the tearme
in our vniuersities the scholers dine at ten. As for the poorest sort
they generallie dine and sup when they may, so that to talke of their
order of repast, it were but a néedlesse matter. I might here take
occasion also to set downe the varietie vsed by antiquitie in their
beginnings of their diets, wherin almost euerie nation had a seuerall
fashion, some beginning of custome (as we doo in summer time) with
salets at supper, and some ending with lettice, some making their entrie
with egs, and shutting vp their tables with mulberies, as we doo with
<span class="page"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[Page 289]</span>
fruit and conceits of all sorts. Diuerse (as the old Romans) began with
a few crops of rue, as the Venetians did with the fish called Gobius,
the Belgies with butter (or as we doo yet also) with butter and egs vpon
fish daies. But whereas we commonlie begin with the most grosse food,
and end with the most delicate, the Scot thinking much to leaue the best
for his meniall seruants maketh his entrance at the best, so that he is
sure therby to leaue the worst. We vse also our wines by degrees, so
that the hotest commeth last to the table, but to stand vpon such toies
would spend much time, and turne to small profit, wherfore I will deale
with other things more necessarie for this turne.</p>

<small>OF THEIR APPARELL AND ATTIRE.</small><br />

CHAP. VII.</h3>

<p>An Englishman, indeuoring sometime to write of our attire, made sundrie
platformes for his purpose, supposing by some of them to find out one
stedfast ground whereon to build the summe of his discourse. But in the
end (like an oratour long without exercise) when he saw what a difficult
péece of worke he had taken in hand, he gaue ouer his trauell, and
onelie drue the picture of a naked man, vnto whome he gaue a paire of
sheares in the one hand, and a peece of cloth in the other, to the end
he should shape his apparell after such fashion as himselfe liked, sith
he could find no kind of garment that could please him anie while
<span class="leftnote">Andrew Beerd.</span>
togither, and this he called an Englishman. Certes this writer
(otherwise being a lewd popish hypocrite and vngratious priest) shewed
himselfe herein not to be altogether void of iudgement, sith the
phantasticall follie of our nation, euen from the courtier to the carter
is such, that no forme of apparell liketh vs longer than the first
garment is in the wearing, if it continue so long and be not laid aside,
to receiue some other trinket newlie deuised by the fickle headed
tailors, who couet to haue seuerall trickes in cutting, thereby to draw
fond customers to more expense of monie. For my part I can tell better
how to inueigh against this enormitie, than describe anie certeintie of
<span class="leftnote">Strange cuts.</span>
our attire: sithence such is our mutabilitie, that to daie there is none
to the Spanish guise, to morrow the French toies are most fine and
delectable, yer long no such apparell as that which is after the high
Alman fashion, by and by the Turkish maner is generallie best liked of,
otherwise the Morisco gowns, the Barbarian sléeues, the mandilion worne
to Collie weston ward, and the short French breches make such a comelie
vesture, that except it were a dog in a doublet, you shall not sée anie
so disguised, as are my countrie men of England. And as these fashions
are diuerse, so likewise it is a world to see the costlinesse and the
curiositie: the excesse and the vanitie: the pompe and the brauerie: the
change and the varietie: and finallie the ficklenesse and the follie
that is in all degrees: in somuch that nothing is more constant in
<span class="leftnote">Much cost vpon the bodie, and little vpon the soule.</span>
England than inconstancie of attire. Oh how much cost is bestowed now
adaies vpon our bodies and how little vpon our soules! how manie sutes
of apparell hath the one and how little furniture hath the other? how
long time is asked in decking vp of the first, and how little space left
wherin to féed the later? how curious, how nice also are a number of men
and women, and how hardlie can the tailor please them in making it fit
for their bodies? how manie times must it be sent backe againe to him
that made it? what chafing, what fretting, what reprochfull language
doth the poore workeman beare awaie? and manie times when he dooth
nothing to it at all, yet when it is brought home againe it is verie fit
and handsome; then must we put it on, then must the long seames of our
hose be set by a plumb-line, then we puffe, then we blow, and finallie
sweat till we drop, that our clothes may stand well vpon vs. I will saie
nothing of our heads, which sometimes are polled, sometimes curled, or
suffered to grow at length like womans lockes, manie times cut off aboue
or vnder the eares round as by a woodden dish. Neither will I meddle
<span class="leftnote">Beards.</span>
with our varietie of beards, of which some are shauen from the chin like
those of Turks, not a few cut short like to the beard of marques Otto,
<span class="page"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[Page 290]</span>
some made round like a rubbing brush, other with a pique de vant (O fine
fashion!) or now and then suffered to grow long, the barbers being
growen to be so cunning in this behalfe as the tailors. And therefore if
a man haue a leane and streight face, a marquesse Ottons cut will make
it broad and large; if it be platter like, a long slender beard will
make it séeme the narrower; if he be wesell becked, then much heare left
on the chéekes will make the owner looke big like a bowdled hen, and so
grim as a goose, if Cornelis of Chelmeresford saie true: manie old men
doo weare no beards at all. Some lustie courtiers also and gentlemen of
courage, doo weare either rings of gold, stones, or pearle in their
eares, whereby they imagine the workemanship of God not to be a little
amended. But herein they rather disgrace than adorne their persons, as
by their nicenesse in apparell, for which I saie most nations doo not
vniustlie deride vs, as also for that we doo séeme to imitate all
nations round about vs, wherein we be like to the Polypus or Chameleon;
and therevnto bestow most cost vpon our arses, &amp; much more than vpon all
<span class="leftnote">Excesse in women.</span>
the rest of our bodies, as women doo likewise vpon their heads and
shoulders. In women also it is most to be lamented, that they doo now
farre excéed the lightnesse of our men (who neuerthelesse are
transformed from the cap euen to the verie shoo) and such staring attire
as in time past was supposed méet for none but light housewiues onelie,
is now become an habit for chast and sober matrones. What should I saie
of their doublets with pendant codpéeses on the brest full of iags &amp;
cuts, and sléeues of sundrie colours? their galligascons to beare out
their bums &amp; make their attire to sit plum round (as they terme it)
about them? their fardingals, and diuerslie coloured nether stocks of
silke, ierdseie, and such like, whereby their bodies are rather deformed
than commended? I haue met with some of these trulles in London so
disguised, that it hath passed my skill to discerne whether they were
men or women.</p>

<p>Thus it is now come to passe, that women are become men, and men
transformed into monsters: and those good gifts which almightie God hath
giuen vnto vs to reléeue our necessities withall (as a nation turning
altogither the grace of God into wantonnesse, for</p>

<p class="ind1">Luxuriant animi rebus plerunque secundis)</p>

<p>not otherwise bestowed than in all excesse, as if we wist not otherwise
how to consume and wast them. I praie God that in this behalfe our sinne
<span class="rightnote">Ezech. 16.</span>
be not like vnto that of Sodoma and Gomorha, whose errors were pride,
excesse of diet, and abuse of Gods benefits aboundantlie bestowed vpon
them, beside want of charitie toward the poore, and certeine other
points which the prophet shutteth vp in silence. Certes the
common-wealth cannot be said to florish where these abuses reigne, but
is rather oppressed by vnreasonable exactions made vpon rich farmers,
and of poore tenants, wherewith to mainteine the same. Neither was it
euer merier with England, than when an Englishman was knowne abroad by
his owne cloth, and contented himselfe at home with his fine carsie
hosen, and a meane slop: his coat, gowne, and cloake of browne blue or
puke, with some pretie furniture of veluet or furre, and a doublet of
sad tawnie, or blacke veluet, or other comelie silke, without such cuts
and gawrish colours as are worne in these daies, and neuer brought in
but by the consent of the French, who thinke themselues the gaiest men,
when they haue most diuersities of iagges and change of colours about
<span class="leftnote">Attire of merchants.</span>
them. Certes of all estates our merchants doo least alter their attire,
and therefore are most to be commended: for albeit that which they weare
be verie fine and costlie, yet in forme and colour it representeth a
great péece of the ancient grauitie apperteining to citizens and
burgesses, albeit the yoonger sort of their wiues both in attire and
costlie housekeeping can not tell when and how to make an end, as being
women in déed in whome all kind of curiositie is to be found and seene,
and in farre greater measure than in women of higher calling. I might
here name a sort of hewes deuised for the nonce, wherewith to please
phantasticall heads, as gooseturd gréene, pease porridge tawnie,
popingaie blue, lustie gallant, the diuell in the head (I should saie
the hedge) and such like: but I passe them ouer thinking it sufficient
to haue said thus much of apparell generallie, when nothing can
particularlie be spoken of anie constancie thereof.</p>

<small>OF THE HIGH COURT OF PARLEMENT, AND AUTHORITIE OF THE SAME.</small><br />

CHAP. VIII.</h3>

<p>In speaking of parlement lawe, I haue in the chapiter precedent said
somewhat of this high and most honorable court. Wherefore it shall not
néed to remember ought héere that is there touched: I will onelie speake
of other things therefore concerning the estate of assemblie, whereby
the magnificence thereof shall be in some part better knowne vnto such
as shall come after vs. This house hath the most high and absolute power
of the realme, for thereby kings and mightie princes haue from time to
time béene deposed from their thrones, lawes either enacted or
abrogated, offendors of all sorts punished, and corrupted religion
<span class="leftnote">The parlement house diuideth the estate of the
realme into nobilitie and the commons.</span>
either dissanulled or reformed, which commonlie is diuided into two
houses or parts, the higher or vpper <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hous econsisting'">house consisting</ins> of the nobilitie,
including all euen vnto the baron and bishop: the lower called the
nether house of knights, squires, gentlemen, and burgesses of the
commons, with whome also the inferior members of the cleargie are
ioined, albeit they sit in diuerse places, and these haue to deale
onelie in matters of religion, till it come that they ioine with the
rest in confirmation of all such acts as are to passe in the same. For
without the consent of the thrée estates, that is, of the nobilitie,
cleargie, and laietie, sildome anie thing is said to be concluded vpon,
and brought vnto the prince for his consent and allowance. To be short,
whatsoeuer the people of Rome did in their Centuriatis or Tribunitijs
comitijs, the same is and may be doone by authoritie of our parlement
house, which is the head and bodie of all the realme, and the place
wherein euerie particular person is intended to be present, if not by
himselfe, yet by his aduocate or atturneie. For this cause also any
thing ther enacted is not to be misliked, but obeied of all men without
<span class="leftnote">Time of summons.</span>
contradiction or grudge. By the space of fortie dais, before this
assemblie be begun, the prince sendeth his writs vnto all his nobilitie
particularlie, summoning them to appeare at the said court. The like he
doth to the shiriffe of euerie countie; with commandement to choose two
knights within ech of their counties, to giue their aduise in the name
of the shire, likewise to euerie citie and towne, that they may choose
their burgesses, which commonlie are men best skilled in the state of
their citie or towne, either for the declaration of such benefits as
they want, or to shew which waie to reforme such enormities as thorough
the practises of ill members are practised and crept in among them: the
first being chosen by the gentlemen of the shire, the other by the
citizens and burgesses of euerie citie and towne, whereby that court is
furnished. The first daie of the parlement being come, the lords of the
<span class="leftnote">Of the vpper house.</span>
vpper house, as well ecclesiasticall as temporall, doo attend vpon the
prince, who rideth thither in person, as it were to open the doore of
their authoritie; and being come into the place, after praiers made, and
causes shewed, wherefore some not present are inforced to be absent,
each man taketh his place according to his degrée. The house it selfe is
curiouslie furnished with tapisterie, and the king being set in his
throne, the spirituall lords take vp the side of the house which is on
<span class="leftnote">Places of the peeres.</span>
the right hand of the prince, and the temporall lords the left, I meane,
so well dukes and earles, as viscounts and barons, as I before
remembred. In the middest and a pretie distance from the prince, lie
certeine sackes stuffed with wooll or haire, wheron the iudges of the
realme, the master of the rols, and secretaries of estate doo sit.
Howbeit these iudges haue no voice in the house, but onelie shew what
their opinion is of such &amp; such matters as come in question among the
lords, if they be commanded so to doo: as the secretaries are to answer
such letters or things passed in the councell, whereof they haue the
custodie &amp; knowledge. Finallie, the consent of this house is giuen by
each man seuerallie, first for himselfe being present, then seuerallie
for so manie as he hath letters &amp; proxies directed vnto him, saieng
onelie; Content or Not content, without any further debating. Of the
number assembled in the lower house, I haue alreadie made a generall
report in the chapter precedent, and their particulars shall follow here
<span class="page"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[Page 292]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Of the lower house.<br />
Speaker.</span>
at hand. These therefore being called ouer by name do choose a speaker,
who is as it were their mouth, and him they present vnto the prince, in
whom it is either to refuse or admit him by the lord chancellor, who in
the princes name dooth answer vnto his oration, made at his first
entrance &amp; presentation into the house, wherein he declareth the good
liking that the king hath conceiued of his choise vnto that office &amp;
<span class="leftnote">Petitions of the speaker.</span>
function. Being admitted, he maketh fiue requests vnto that honorable
assemblie, first that the house may (as in times past) inioy hir former
liberties and priuileges: secondlie, that the congregates may frankelie
shew their minds vpon such matters as are to come in question: thirdlie,
that if anie of the lower house doo giue anie cause of offense during
the continuance of this assemblie, that the same may inflict such
punishment vpon the partie culpable, as to the said assemblie shall be
thought conuenient: fourthlie, if anie doubt should arise among them of
the lower house, that he in their name might haue frée accesse and
recourse vnto his maiestie &amp; lords of the higher house, to be further
instructed and resolued in the same: fiftlie and last, he craueth pardon
for himselfe, if in his going to and fro betweene the houses, he forget
or mistake anie thing, requiring that he may returne and be better
informed in such things as he did faile in without offense: vnto which
petitions the lord chancellor dooth answer as apperteineth, and this is
doone on the first daie, or peraduenture the second, if it could not be
conuenientlie performed in the first.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Clerke of the parlement.</span>
Beside the lord chancellor there is another in the vpper house called
the clerke of the parlement, whose office is to read the billes. For
euerie thing that commeth in consultation in either house, is first put
in writing in paper, which being read, he that listeth riseth vp and
speaketh either with it or against it, and so one after another so long
as they shall thinke good; that doone they go to another, and so to the
third, &amp;c: the instrument still wholie or in part raced or reformed, as
cause moueth for the amendment of the same if the substance be reputed
necessarie. In the vpper house the lord chancellor demandeth if they
will haue it ingrossed, that is to saie, put in parchment, which doone,
it is read the third time, &amp; after debating of the matter to and fro if
the more part doo conclude withall, vpon the vtterance of these words,
"Are ye contented that it be enacted or no?" the clerke writeth
vnderneath "Soit baille aux commons," and so when they sée time they
send such billes approued to the commons by some of them that sit on the
wooll sackes, who comming into the house, &amp; demanding licence to speake,
doo vse this kind of words or the like to the speaker, as sir Thomas
Smith dooth deliuer and set them downe, whose onelie direction I vse,
and almost word for word in this chapter, requiting him with the like
borowage as he hath vsed toward me in his discourse of the sundrie
degrées of estates in the common-wealth of England, which (as I hope)
shall be no discredit to his trauell. "Master speaker, my lords of the
vpper house haue passed amongst them, and thinke good that there should
be enacted by parlement such an act, and such an act (reading their
titles in such sort as he receiued them) they praie you therefore to
consider &amp; shew your aduise vpon them." Which doone they go their waie,
and the doore being shut after them, the speaker declareth what message
was sent vnto them, and if they be then void of consultation vpon anie
other bill, he presentlie demandeth what their pleasures are, first of
one, then of another, &amp;c: which are solemnelie read, or their contents
bréeflie shewed and then debated vpon among them.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Of the nether house.</span>
The speaker sitteth in a chaire erected somewhat higher than the rest,
that he may sée and be séene of all men, and before him on a lower seat
sitteth his clerke, who readeth such bils as be first propounded in the
lower house, or sent downe from the lords: for in that point each house
hath equall authoritie to propound what they thinke méet, either for the
abrogation of old or making of new lawes. All bils be thrise and on
diuerse daies read and disputed vpon before they come to the question,
which is, whether they shall be enacted or not; and in discourse vpon
them, verie good order is vsed in the lower house, wherein he that will
speake giueth notice thereof by standing vp bare headed. If manie stand
vp at once (as now &amp; then it happeneth) he speaketh first that was first
seene to moue out of his place, and telleth his tale vnto the speaker,
without rehersall of his name whose speches he meaneth to confute, so
that with a perpetuall oration &amp; not with altercation these discourses
<span class="page"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[Page 293]</span>
are continued. But as the partie confuted may not replie on that daie,
so one man can not speake twise to one bill in one daie though he would
change his opinion, but on the next he may speake againe, &amp; yet but once
as afore. No vile, seditious, vnreuerent or biting words are vsed in
this assemblie, yet if anie happen to escape and be vttered, the partie
is punished according to the censure of the assemblie and custome in
that behalfe. In the afternoone they sit not except vpon some vrgent
occasion, neither hath the speaker anie voice in that house, wherewith
to moue or dissuade the furtherance or staie of anie bill, but his
office is vpon the reading thereof breeflie to declare the contents. If
anie bill passe, which commeth vnto them from the lords, it is thus
subscribed, "Les commons ont assentus:" so if the lords agree vpon anie
bill sent vnto them from the commons, it is subscribed after this maner,
"Les seigniours ont assentus." If it be not agreed on after thrise
reading, there is conference required and had betwéene the vpper and
nether houses, by certeine appointed for that purpose vpon the points in
question, wherevpon if no finall agréement by the more part can be
obteined, the bill is dashed and reiected, or (as the saieng is) cleane
cast out of the doores. None of the nether house can giue his voice by
proxie but in his owne person, and after the bill twise read, then
ingrossed and the third time read againe &amp; discoursed vpon, the speaker
asketh if they will go to the question, whervnto if they agree he
holdeth vp the bill &amp; saith; "So manie as will haue this bill go forward
saie Yea:" hervpon so manie as allow of the thing crie Yea, the other
No, &amp; as the crie is more or lesse on either side, so is the bill to
staie or else go forward. If the number of negatiue and affirmatiue
voices seeme to be equall, so manie as allow of the bill go downe
withall, the rest sit still, and being told by the poll the greater part
doo carrie away the matter. If something be allowed and in some part
reiected, the bill is put to certeine committées to be amended, &amp; then
being brought in againe, it is read and passeth or staieth as the voices
yéeld therto. This is the order of the passage of our lawes, which are
not ratified till both houses haue agréed vnto them, and yet not holden
for law till the prince haue giuen his assent. Vpon the last daie
therfore of the parlement or session, the prince commeth in person
againe into the house, in his robes as at the first. Where after thanks
giuen to the prince, first in the name of the lords by the lord
chancellor, then in the name of the commons by the speaker for his great
care of the welfare of his realme, &amp;c: the lord chancellor in the
princes name giueth thanks to the lords &amp; commons likewise for their
paines, with promise of recompense as opportunitie &amp; occasion shall
serue therefore. This doone one readeth the title of euerie act passed
in that session, and then it is noted vpon them what the prince doth
allow of with these words, "Le roy veult." If the prince like not of
them, it is written vpon them "Le roy aduisera." And so those acts are
dashed, as the other from thencefoorth are taken and holden for law, and
all imprinted except such as concerne some priuat persons, which are
onelie exemplified vnder the seale of the parlement, as priuileges to
his vse. And this is the summe of the maner after which our parlements
in England are holden, without which no forfaiture of life, member or
lands of anie Englishman, where no law is ordeined for the same before
hand, is auailable or can take place amongst vs. And so much in maner
out of the third chapiter of the second booke of the common-wealth of
England written by sir Thomas Smith: whervnto I will annex a table of
the counties, cities, boroughs and ports, which send knights, burgesses,
and barons to the parlement house, and dooth insue as followeth.</p>

<small>OF THE LAWES OF ENGLAND SINCE HIR FIRST INHABITATION.</small><br />

CHAP. IX.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">Samothes.</span>
That Samothes or Dis gaue the first lawes to the Celtes (whose kingdome
he erected about the fiftéenth of Nimbrote) the testimonie of Berosus is
proofe sufficient. For he not onelie affirmeth him to publish the same
in the fourth of Ninus, but also addeth thereto, how there liued none in
his daies of more excellent wisdome, nor politike inuention than he,
whereof he was named Samothes, as some other do affirme. What his lawes
were, it is now altogither vnknowne, as most things of this age; but
<span class="leftnote">Albion.</span>
that they were altered againe at the comming of Albion, no man can
absolutelie denie, sith new lords vse commonlie to giue new lawes, and
conquerors abolish such as were in vse before them.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Brute.</span>
The like also may be affirmed of our Brute, notwithstanding that the
certeine knowledge so well of the one as of the other is perished, and
nothing worthie memorie left of all their dooings. Somewhat yet we haue
<span class="leftnote">Mulmutius.</span>
of Mulmutius, who not onelie subdued such princes as reigned in this
land, but also brought the realme to good order, that long before had
béene torne with ciuill discord. But where his lawes are to be found,
and which they be from other mens, no man liuing in these daies is able
to determine.</p>

<p>Certes, there was neuer prince in Britaine, of whome his subiects
conceiued better hope in the beginning, than of Bladudus, and yet I read
of none that made so ridiculous an end: in like sort there hath not
reigned anie monarch in this Ile, whose waies were more feared at the
<span class="leftnote">The praise of Dunwallon.</span>
first, than those of Dunwallon (king Henrie the fift excepted) and yet
in the end he prooued such a prince, as after his death there was in
maner no subiect, that did not lament his funerals. And this onelie for
his policie in gouernance, seuere administration of iustice, and
prouident framing of his lawes and constitutions, for the gouernment of
his subiects. His people also, coueting to continue his name vnto
posteritie, intituled those his ordinances according to their maker,
calling them by the name of the lawes of Mulmutius, which indured in
execution among the Britons, so long as our homelings had the dominion
of this Ile. Afterward when the comeling Saxons had once obteined the
superioritie of the kingdom, the maiestie of those lawes fell for a time
into such decaie, that although "Non penitùs cecidit, tamen potuit
cecidisse videri," as Leland saith, and the decrées themselues had
vtterlie perished in déed at the verie first brunt, had they not beene
preserued in Wales, where they remained amongst the relikes of the
Britons, &amp; not onlie vntill the comming of the Normans, but euen vntill
the time of Edward the first, who obteining the souereigntie of that
portion, indeuoured verie earnestlie to extinguish those of Mulmutius,
and to establish his owne.</p>

<p>But as the Saxons at their first arriuall did what they could to abolish
the British lawes, so in processe of time they yéelded a little to
relent, &amp; not so much to abhorre and mislike of the lawes of Mulmutius,
as to receiue and imbrace the same, especiallie at such time as the said
Saxon princes entered into amitie with the British nobilitie, and after
that began to ioine in matrimonie with the British ladies, as the
British barons did with the Saxon frowes, both by an especiall statute
and decrée, wherof in another treatise I haue made mention at large.
Héerof also it came to passe in the end, that they were contented to
<span class="page"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[Page 298]</span>
make a choise, and insert no small numbers of them into their owne
volumes, as may be gathered by those of Athelbert the great, surnamed
king of Kent, Inas and Alfred kings of the west Saxons, and diuerse
other yet extant to be séene. Such also was the lateward estimation of
them, that when anie of the Saxon princes went about to make new
ordinances, they caused those of Mulmutius (which Gildas sometime
translated into Latine) to be first expounded vnto them, and in this
perusall if they found anie there alreadie framed, that might serue
their turnes, they foorthwith reuiued the same, and annexed them to
their owne.</p>

<p>But in this dealing, the diligence of Alfred is most of all to be
commended, who not onelie chose out the best, but gathered togither all
such whatsoeuer the said Mulmutius had made: and then to the end they
should lie no more in corners as forlorne bookes, and vnknowne to the
learned of his kingdome, he caused them to be turned into the Saxon
toong, wherein they continued long after his decease.</p>

<p>As for the Normans, who for a season neither regarded the British, nor
cared for the Saxon statutes, they also at the first vtterlie misliked
of them, till at the last, when they had well weied that one kind of
regiment is not conuenient for all peoples, and that no stranger, being
in a forren countrie newlie brought vnder obedience, could make such
equall ordinances, as he might thereby gouerne his new common-wealth
without some care &amp; trouble: they fell in with such a desire to sée by
what rule the state of the land was gouerned in time of the Saxons, that
hauing perused the same, they not onelie commended their maner of
regiment, but also admitted a great part of their lawes (now currant
vnder the name of S. Edwards lawes, and vsed as principles and grounds)
whereby they not onelie qualified the rigor of their owne, and mitigated
their almost intollerable burden of seruitude which they had latelie
laid vpon the shoulders of the English, but also left vs a great number
of the old Mulmutian lawes, whereof the most part are in vse to this
daie as I said, albeit that we know not certeinlie how to distinguish
them from others, that are in strength amongst vs.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Martia.</span>
After Dunwallon, the next lawgiuer was Martia, whome Leland surnameth
Proba; and after him Iohn Bale also, who in his Centuries dooth iustlie
confesse himselfe to haue béene holpen by the said Leland, as I my selfe
doo likewise for manie things conteined in this treatise. Shée was wife
vnto Gutteline king of the Britons: and being made protectrix of the
realme, after hir husbands deceasse in the nonage of hir sonne, and
séeing manie things dailie to grow vp among hir people worthie
reformation, she deuised sundrie and those verie politike lawes, for the
gouernance of hir kingdome, which hir subiects when she was dead and
gone, did name the Martian statutes. Who turned them into Latine, as yet
I doo not read, howbeit (as I said before of the lawes of Mulmutius) so
the same Alfred caused those of this excellentlie well learned ladie
(whome diuerse commend also for hir great knowledge in the Gréeke toong)
to be turned into his owne language, wherevpon it came to passe that
they were dailie executed among his subiects, afterward allowed of
(among the rest) by the Normans, and finallie remaine in vse in these
our daies, notwithstanding that we can not disseuer them also verie
readilie from the other.</p>

<p>The seuenth alteration of lawes was practised by the Saxons, for I
ouerpasse the vse of the ciuill ordinances vsed in Rome, finallie
brought hither by the Romans, &amp; yet in perfect notice among the
Ciuilians of our countrie, though neuer generallie nor fullie receiued
by all the seuerall regions of this Iland. Certes there are great
numbers of these later, which yet remaine in sound knowlege, and are to
be read, being comprehended for the most part vnder the names of the
<span class="leftnote">Martian Law.<br />
Saxon Law.<br />
Dane Law.</span>
Martian and the Saxon law. Beside these also I read of the Dane law, so
that the people of middle England were ruled by the first, the west
Saxons by the second; as Essex, Norffolke, Suffolke, Cambridgeshire, and
part of Herfordshire were by the third, of all the rest the most
inequall and intollerable. And as in these daies what soeuer the prince
in publike assemblie commanded vpon the necessitie of his subiects, or
his owne voluntarie authoritie, was counted for law: so none of them had
appointed anie certeine place, wherevnto his people might repaire at
fixed times for iustice, but caused them to resort commonlie to their
palaces, where in proper person they would often determine their causes,
<span class="page"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[Page 299]</span>
and so make shortest worke, or else commit the same to the hearing of
other, and so dispatch them awaie. Neither had they any house appointed
to assemble in for the making of their ordinances, as we haue now at
Westminster. Wherefore Edmund gaue lawes at London &amp; Lincolne, Ethelred
at Habam, Alfred at Woodstock and Wannetting, Athelstane in Excester,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: also called 'Crekelade'; original reads 'Grecklade'">Cricklade</ins>, Feuersham, &amp; Thundersleie, Canutus at Winchester, &amp;c: other
in other places, whereof this may suffice.</p>

<p>Among other things also vsed in the time of the Saxons, it shall not be
amisse to set downe the forme of their Ordalian law, which they brought
hither with them from beyond the seas out of Scithia, and vsed onelie in
the triall of guiltie and vnguiltinesse. Certes it conteined not an
ordinarie procéeding by daies and termes, as in the ciuill and common
law we sée practised in these daies; but a short dispatch &amp; triall of
the matter by fire or water, whereof at this present I will deliuer the
circumstance, as I haue faithfullie translated it out of an ancient
volume, and conferred with an imprinted copie, latelie published by M.
Lambert, and now extant to be read. Neuerthelesse, as the Scithians were
the first that vsed this practise, so I read that it was taken vp and
occupied also in France in processe of time, yea and likewise in Grecia,
as G. Pachymerus remembreth in the first booke of his historie (which
beginneth with the empire of M. Paleologus) where he noteth his owne
sight and vew in that behalfe. But what stand I herevpon?</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Ordalian law.</span>
The Ordalian (saith the aforesaid author) was a certeine maner of
<span class="rightnote">Fire.</span>
purgation vsed two waies, wherof the one was by fire, the other by
water. In the execution of that which was doone by fire, the partie
accused should go a certeine number of pases, with an hot iron in his
hand, or else bare footed vpon certeine plough shares red hot, according
to the maner. This iron was sometime of one pound weight, and then was
it called single Ordalium, sometimes of thrée, and then named treble
Ordalium, and whosoeuer did beare or tread on the same without hurt of
his bodie he was adiudged guiltlesse, otherwise if his skin were
scorched, he was foorthwith condemned as guiltie of the trespasse
whereof he was accused, according to the proportion and quantitie of the
burning.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Water.</span>
There were in like sort two kinds of triall by the water, that is to
say, either by hot or cold: and in this triall the partie thought
culpable, was either tumbled into some pond or huge vessell of cold
water, wherein if he continued for a season, without wrestling or
strugling for life, he was foorthwith acquited as guiltlesse of the fact
wherof he was accused: but if he began to plunge, and labour once for
breath immediatlie vpon his falling into that liquor, he was by and by
condemned as guiltie of the crime. Or else he did thrust his arme vp to
the shoulder into a lead, copper, or caldron of seething water, from
whence if he withdrew the same without anie maner of damage, he was
discharged of further molestation: otherwise he was taken for a
trespasser, and punished accordinglie. The fierie maner of purgation
belonged onelie to noble men and women, and such as were frée borne: but
the husbandmen and villaines were tried by water. Wherof to shew the
vnlearned dealing and blind ignorance of those times, it shall not be
impertinent to set foorth the whole maner, which continued here in
England vntill the time of King Iohn, who séeing the manifold subtilties
in the same (by sundrie sorcerous and artificiall practises whereby the
working of the said elements were restreined) did extinguish it
altogither as flat lewdnesse and bouerie. The Rubrike of the treatise
entereth thus: "<em>Here beginneth the execution of iustice, whereby the
giltie or vngiltie are tried by hot iron.</em> Then it followeth: <em>After
accusation lawfullie made, and three daies spent in fasting and praier,
the priest being clad in all his holie vestures, sauing his vestiment,
shall take the iron laid before the altar with a paire of tongs, and
singing the hymne of the three children</em>, that is to saie, O all ye
workes of God the Lord, and in Latine Benedicite omnia opera, &amp;c: <em>he
shall carie it solemnelie to the fire (alreadie made for that purpose)
and first saie these words ouer the place where the fire is kindled,
whereby this purgation shall be made in Latine as insueth:</em> Benedic
Domine Deus locum istum, vt sit nobis in eo sanitas, sanctitas, castitas,
virtus, &amp; victoria, &amp; sanctimonia, humilitas, bonitas, lenitas, &amp;
plenitudo legis, &amp; obedientia Deo patri, &amp; filio, &amp; spiritui sancto. Hæc
<span class="page"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[Page 300]</span>
benedictio sit super hunc locum, &amp; super omnes habitantes in eo. <em>In
English:</em> Blesse thou O Lord this place, that it may be to vs health,
holinesse, chastitie, vertue, and victorie, purenesse, humilitie,
goodnesse, gentlenesse, and fulnesse of the law, and obedience to God
the father, the sonne, and the holie ghost. This blessing be vpon this
place, and all that dwell in it. <em>Then followeth the blessing of the
fire.</em> Domine Deus pater omnipotens, lumen indeficiens, exaudi nos, quia
tu es conditor omnium luminum. Benedic Domine hoc lumen, quod ante
sanctificatum est, qui illuminasti omnem hominem venientem in hunc
mundum (vel mundum) vt ab eo lumine accendamur igne claritatis tuæ. Et
sicut igne illuminasti Mosen, ita nunc illumina corda nostra, &amp; sensus
nostros, vt ad vitam æternam mereamur peruenire, per Christum, &amp;c. Lord
God father almightie, light euerlasting, heare vs, sith thou art the
maker of all lights. Blesse O Lord this light, that is alreadie
sanctified in thy sight, which hast lightned all men that come into the
world (or the whole world) to the end that by the same light we may be
lightned with the shining of thy brightnesse. As thou diddest lighten
Moses, so now illuminate our hearts, and our senses, that we may deserue
to come to euerlasting life, through Christ our, &amp;c. <em>This being ended
let him say the</em> Pater noster, &amp;c: <em>then these words:</em> Saluum fac
seruum, &amp;c. Mitte ei auxilium Deus, &amp;c. De Sion tuere eum, &amp;c. Dominus
vobiscum, &amp;c. <em>That is</em>, O Lord saue thy seruant, &amp;c. Send him helpe O
God from thy holie place, &amp;c. Defend him out of Sion, &amp;c. Lord heare,
&amp;c. The Lord be with you, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"<em>The praier.</em> Benedic Domine sancte pater, omnipotens Deus, per
inuocationem sanctissimi nominis tui, &amp; per aduentum filij tui, atque
per donum spiritus paracleti, ad manifestandum verum iudicium tuum, hoc
genus metalli, vt sit sanctificatum, &amp; omni dæmonum falsitate procul
remota, veritas veri iudicij tui fidelibus tuis manifesta fiat, per
eundem Dominum, &amp;c. <em>In English:</em> Blesse we beséech thee O Lord, holie
father, euerlasting God, through the inuocation of thy most holie name,
by the comming of thy sonne, and gift of the holie ghost, and to the
manifestation of thy true iudgement, this kind of mettall, that being
hallowed, and all fraudulent practises of the diuels vtterlie remoued,
the manifest truth of thy true iudgement may be reuealed, by the same
Lord Iesus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"<em>After this, let the iron be laid into the fire, and sprinkled with
holie water, and whilest it heateth, let the priest go to masse, and doo
as order requireth: and when he hath receiued the host, he shall call
the man that is to be purged (as it is written hereafter) first adiuring
him, and then permitting him to communicate according to the maner.</em></p>

<p class="center"><b><em>The office of the masse.</em></b></p>

<p class="center">"Iustus es Domine, &amp;c. O Lord thou art iust, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center"><b><em>The Praier.</em></b></p>

<p>"Absolue quæsumus Domine delicta famuli tui, vt à peccatorum suorum
nexibus, quæ pro sua fragilitate contraxit, tua benignitate liberetur, &amp;
in hoc iudicio quoad meruit, iustitia tua præueniente, ad veritatis
censuram peruenire mereatur, per Christum Dominum, &amp;c. <em>That is:</em>
Pardon we beséech thée O Lord, the sinnes of thy seruant, that being
deliuered from the burden of his offenses, wherewith he is intangled, he
may be cleared by thy benignitie, and in this his triall (so far as he
hath deserued thy mercie preuenting him) he may come to the knowledge of
the truth, by Christ our Lord, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center"><b><em>The Gospell.</em> Mar. 10.</b></p>

<p>"In illo tempore, cùm egressus esset Iesus in via, procurrens quidam
genu flexo ante eum, rogabat eum dicens, Magister bone, quid faciam vt
vitam æternam percipiam? Iesus autem dixit ei, Quid me dicis bonum? &amp;c.
In those daies when Iesus went foorth toward his iourneie, and one
méeting him in the waie running, and knéeling vnto him, asked him saieng:
<span class="page"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[Page 301]</span>
Good master what shall I doo that I may possesse eternall life? Iesus
said vnto him, Whie callest thou me good? &amp;c. <em>Then followeth the
secret, and so foorth all of the rest of the masse. But before the
partie dooth communicate, the priest shall vse these words vnto him:</em>
Adiuro te per patrem, &amp; filium, &amp; spiritum sanctum, &amp; per veram
christianitatem quam suscepisti, &amp; per sanctas relliquias quæ in ista
ecclesia sunt, &amp; per baptismum quo te sacerdos regenerauit, vt non
præsumas vllo modo communicare, neq; accedere ad altare, si hoc fecisti
aut consensisti, &amp;c. I adiure thée by the father, the sonne, and the
holie Ghost, by the true christendome which thou hast receiued, by the
holie relikes which are in this church, and by the baptisme wherewith
the priest hath regenerated thée, that thou presume not by any maner of
means to communicate, nor come about the altar, if thou hast doone or
<span class="leftnote">The cup yet in vse.</span>
consented vnto this, whereof thou art accused, &amp;c. <em>Here let the priest
suffer him to communicate, saieng;</em> Corpus hoc, &amp; sanguis Domini nostri
Iesu Christi, sit tibi ad probationem hodie. This bodie &amp; this bloud of
our Lord Iesus Christ, be vnto thee a triall this daie. <em>The praier:</em>
Perceptis Domine Deus noster sacris muneribus, supplices deprecamur, vt
huius participatio sacramenti à proprijs nos reatibus expediat, &amp; in
famulo tuo veritatis sententiam declaret, &amp;c. Hauing receiued O Lord God
these holie mysteries, we humblie beséech thée that the participation of
this sacrament may rid vs of our guiltinesse, and in this thy seruant
set foorth the truth. <em>Then shall follow</em> Kyrieleson, <em>the Letanie, and
certeine Psalmes, and after all them</em> Oremus: Let vs praie. Deus qui per
ignem signa magna ostendens, Abraham puerum tuum de incendio Chaldæorum
quibusdam pereuntibus eruisti, Deus qui rubum ardere ante conspectum
Mosis &amp; minimè comburi permisisti, Deus qui de incendio fornacis
Chaldaicis plerisque succensis, tres pueros tuos illæsos eduxisti, Deus
qui incendio ignis populum Sodomæ inuoluens, Loth famulum tuum cum suis
salute donasti, Deus qui in aduentu sancti spiritus tui, illustratione
ignis fideles tuos ab infidelibus decreuisti: ostende nobis in hoc
prauitatis nostræ examine virtutem eiusdem spiritus, &amp;c: &amp; per ignis
huius feruorem discernere infideles, vt à tactu eius cuius inquisitio
agitur, conscius exhorrescat, &amp; manus eius comburatur, innocens verò
p&oelig;nitus illæsus permaneat, &amp;c. Deus cuius noticiam nulla vnquam
secreta effugiunt, fidei nostræ tua bonitate responde, &amp; præsta vt
quisquis purgandi se gratia, hoc ignitum tulerit ferrum, vel absoluatur
vt innocens, vel noxius detegatur, &amp;c. <em>In English thus:</em> O God, which
in shewing great tokens by fire diddest deliuer Abraham thy seruant from
the burning of the Chaldeis, whilest other perished; O God which
sufferedst the bush to burne in the sight of Moses, and yet not to
consume; O God which deliueredst the thrée children from bodilie harme
in the fornace of the Chaldeis, whilest diuerse were consumed; O God
which by fire didst wrap the people of Sodome in their destruction, and
yet sauedst Lot and his daughters from perill; O God which by the
shining of thy brightnesse at the comming of the holie ghost in
likenesse of fire, diddest separate the faithfull from such as beléeued
not: shew vnto vs in the triall of this our wickednesse, the power of
the same spirit, &amp;c: and by the heat of this fire discerne the faithfull
from the vnfaithfull, that the guiltie whose cause is now in triall, by
touching thereof, may tremble and feare, and his hand be burned, or
being innocent, that he may remaine in safetie, &amp;c. O God from whome no
secrets are hidden, let thy goodnesse answer to our faith, and grant
that whosoeuer in this purgation, shall touch and beare this iron, may
either be tried an innocent, or reuealed as an offender, &amp;c. <em>After this
the priest shall sprinkle the iron with holie water saieng:</em> The
blessing of the father, the sonne, and the holie ghost, be vpon this
iron, to the reuelation of the iust iudgement of God. <em>And foorthwith
let him that is accused beare it, by the length of nine foot, and then
let his hand be wrapped and sealed vp for the space of three daies:
after this if any corruption or raw flesh appeare where the iron touched
it, let him be condemned as guiltie: if it be whole and sound, let him
giue thanks to God.</em>" And thus much of the firie Ordalia, wherevnto
<span class="leftnote">Water.</span>
that of the water hath so precise relation, that in setting foorth of
the one, I haue also described the other, wherefore it shall be but in
vaine to deale anie further withall.</p>

<p>Hitherto also (as I thinke) sufficientlie of such lawes as were in vse
before the conquest. Now it resteth that I should declare the order of
those, that haue beene made and receiued since the comming of the
<span class="page"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[Page 302]</span>
Normans, referred to the eight alteration or change of our maner of
gouernance, and therevnto doo produce thrée score and foure seuerall
courts. But for asmuch as I am no lawier, and therefore haue but little
skill to procéed in the same accordinglie, it shall suffice to set downe
some generall discourse of such as are vsed in our daies, and so much as
I haue gathered by report and common heare-saie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Ciuill law.</span>
We haue therefore in England sundrie lawes, and first of all the ciuill,
vsed in the chancerie, admeraltie, and diuerse other courts, in some of
which, the seuere rigor of iustice is often so mitigated by conscience,
that diuerse things are thereby made easie and tollerable, which
otherwise would appeare to be méere iniurie and extremitie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Canon law.</span>
We haue also a great part of the Canon law dailie practised among vs,
especiallie in cases of tithes, contracts of matrimonie, and such like,
as are vsuallie to be séene in the consistories of our bishops and
higher courts of the two archbishops, where the exercise of the same is
verie hotlie followed. The third sort of lawes that we haue are our
owne, &amp; those alwaies so variable, &amp; subiect to alteration and change,
that oft in one age, diuerse iudgements doo passe vpon one maner of
case, whereby the saieng of the poet,</p>

<p class="ind1">"Tempora mutantur, &amp; nos mutamur in illis,"</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Lawiers of England not alwaies constant in iudgment.</span>
may verie well be applied vnto such, as being vrged with these words; In
such a yeare of the prince, this opinion was taken for sound law; doo
answer nothing else, but that the iudgement of our lawiers is now
altered, so that they saie farre otherwise. The regiment that we haue
therefore after our owne ordinances, dependeth vpon thrée lawes, to wit,
Statute law, Common law, Customarie law, and Prescription, according to
the triple maner of our trials and iudgments, which is by parlement,
verdict of twelue men at an assise, or wager of battell, of which the
last is little vsed in our daies, as no appeale dooth hold in the first
and last rehearsed. But to returne to my purpose.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Parlement law.</span>
The first is deliuered vnto vs by parlement, which court, being for the
most part holden at Westminster néere London, is the highest of all
other, &amp; consisteth of three seuerall sorts of people, that is to saie,
the nobilitie, cleargie, and commons of this realme. And thereto is not
summoned, but vpon vrgent occasion when the prince dooth see his time,
and that by seuerall writs, dated commonlie full six wéekes before it
begin to be holden. Such lawes as are agreed vpon in the higher house by
the lords spirituall and temporall, and in the lower house by the
commons and bodie of the realme (whereof the conuocation of the cleargie
holden in Powles, or if occasion so require in Westminster church, is a
member) there speaking by the mouth of the knights of the shire and
burgesses, remaine in the end to be confirmed by the prince, who
commonlie resorteth thither of custome, vpon the first and last daies of
this court, there to vnderstand what is doone, and giue his roiall
consent to such statutes as him liketh of. Comming therefore thither
into the higher house, and hauing taken his throne, the speaker of the
parlement (for one is alwaies appointed to go betwéene the houses, as an
indifferent mouth for both) readeth openlie the matters there determined
by the said thrée estates, and then craueth the princes consent and
finall confirmation to the same. The king hauing heard the summe and
principall points of each estatute brieflie recited vnto him, answereth
in French with great deliberation vnto such as he liketh ("Il nous
plaist") but to the rest "Il ne plaist," whereby the latter are made
void and frustrate. That also which his maiestie liketh of, is hereby
authorised, confirmed, &amp; euer after holden for law, except it be
repealed in anie the like assemblie. The number of the commons assembled
in the  lower house, beside the cleargie,
<span class="leftnote">Number of congregates in the parlement.</span>
consisteth of ninetie knights. For each shire of
England hath two gentlemen or knights of greatest wisedome and
reputation, chosen out of the bodie of the same for that onelie purpose,
sauing that for Wales one onlie is supposed sufficient in euerie
countie, whereby the number afore mentioned is made vp. There are
likewise fourtie and six citizens, 289 burgesses, and fouretéene barons,
so that the whole assemblie of the laitie of the lower house, consisteth
of foure hundred thirtie and nine persons, if the iust number be
supplied. Of the lawes here made likewise some are penall and restraine
the common law, and some againe are found to inlarge the same. The one
<span class="page"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[Page 303]</span>
sort of these also are for the most part taken strictlie according to
the letter, the other more largelie and beneficiallie after their
intendment and meaning.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Common law.</span>
The Common law standeth vpon sundrie maximes or principles, and yeares
or termes, which doo conteine such cases as by great studie and solemne
argument of the iudges sound practise confirmed by long experience,
fetched euen from the course of most ancient lawes made farre before the
conquest, and thereto the déepest reach and foundations of reason, are
ruled and adiudged for law. Certes these cases are otherwise called
plees or action, wherof there are two sorts, the one criminall and the
other ciuill. The meanes and messengers also to determine those causes
are our writs or bréefes, whereof there are some originall and some
iudiciall. The parties plaintiffe &amp; defendant when they appeare procéed
(if the case doo so require) by plaint or declaration, barre or answer,
replication, reioinder, and so by rebut, surrebut to issue and triall if
occasion so fall out, the one side affirmatiuelie, the other negatiuelie
as common experience teacheth. Our trials and recoueries are either by
verdict and demourre, confession or default, wherein if anie negligence
or trespasse hath béene committed, either in processe and forme, or in
matter and iudgement, the partie grieued may haue a writ of errour to
vndoo the same, but not in the same court where the former iudgement was
giuen.</p>
<p>
Customarie law consisteth of certeine
<span class="rightnote">Customarie law.</span>
laudable customes vsed in some priuat countrie, intended first to begin vpon good and reasonable
considerations, as gauell kind, which is all the male children equallie
to inherit, and continued to this daie in Kent: where it is onelie to my
knowledge reteined, and no where else in England. It was at the first
deuised by the Romans, as appeareth by Cæsar in his c&#333;mentaries,
wherein I find, that to breake and daunt the force of the rebellious
Germans, they made a law that all the male children (or females for want
of males which holdeth still in England) should haue their fathers
inheritance equallie diuided amongst them. By this meanes also it came
to passe, that whereas before time for the space of sixtie yeares, they
had put the Romans to great and manifold troubles, within the space of
thirtie yeares after this law made, their power did wax so feeble, and
such discord fell out amongst themselues, that they were not able to
mainteine warres with the Romans, nor raise anie iust armie against
them. For as a riuer runing with one streame is swift and more
plentifull of water than when it is drained or drawne into manie
branches: so the lands and goods of the ancestors being dispersed
amongst their issue males, of one strong there were raised sundrie
weake, whereby the originall or generall strength to resist the
aduersarie, became infeebled and brought almost to nothing. "Vis vnita
(saith the philosopher) fortior est eadem dispersa," and one good pursse
is better than manie euill, and when euerie man is benefited alike, each
one will séeke to mainteine his priuate estate, and few take care to
prouide for publike welfare.</p>

<p>Burrow kind, is where the yoongest is preferred before the eldest, which
is the custome of manie countries of this region; also the woman to haue
the third of hir husbands possessions, the husband that marieth an heire
to haue such lands as moue by hir during his naturall life, if he
suruiue hir, and hath a child by hir which hath béene heard crie
thorough foure wals, &amp;c: of such like to be learned elsewhere, and
sometimes frequented generallie ouer all.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Prescription.</span>
Prescription is a certeine custome, which hath continued time out of
minde, but it is more particular than customarie law, as where onelie a
parish or some priuat person dooth prescribe to haue common, or a waie
in another mans soile, or tithes to be paid after this or that maner, I
meane otherwise than the common course and order of the law requireth,
whereof let this suffice at this time, in stéed of a larger discourse of
our owne lawes, least I should seeme to enter farre into that whereof I
haue no skill. For what hath the meditation of the law of God to doo
with anie precise knowledge of the law of man, sith they are seuerall
trades, and incident to diuerse persons?</p>

<p>There are also sundrie vsuall courts holden once in euerie quarter of
<span class="leftnote">Terme.</span>
the yeare, which we commonlie call termes, of the Latine word Terminus,
wherein all controuersies are determined, that happen within the Quéenes
dominions. These are commonlie holden at London, except vpon some great
<span class="page"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[Page 304]</span>
occasion they be transferred to other places. At what times also they
are kept both for spirituall and temporall dealing, the table insuing
shall easilie declare. Finallie how well they are followed by sutors,
the great wealth of lawiers without anie trauell of mine can readilie
expresse. For as after the comming of the Normans the nobilitie had the
start, and after them the cleargie: so now all the wealth of the land
dooth flow vnto our common lawiers, of whome some one hauing practised
little aboue thirteene or fourtéene yeares is able to buie a purchase of
so manie 1000 pounds: which argueth that they wax rich apace, and will
be richer if their clients become not the more wiser &amp; warie hereafter.
It is not long, since a sergeant at the law (whome I could name) was
arrested vpon an extent, for thrée or foure hundred pounds, and another
standing by did greatlie maruell that he could not spare the gaines of
one terme for the satisfaction of that dutie. The time hath béene that
our lawiers did sit in Powles vpon stooles against the pillers and
walles to get clients, but now some of them will not come from their
chambers to the Guildhall in London vnder ten pounds or twentie nobles
at the lest. And one being demanded why he made so much of his trauell,
answered, that it was but follie for him to go so farre, when he was
assured to get more monie by sitting still at home. A friend of mine
also had a sute of late of some valure, and to be sure of counsell at
his time, he gaue vnto two lawiers (whose names I forbeare to deliuer)
twentie shillings a peece, telling them of the daie and houre wherein
<span class="leftnote">Deceipt.</span>
his matter should be called vpon. To be short, they came not vnto the
barre at all, whervpon he staied for that daie. On the morrow after he
met them againe, increased his former gifts by so much more, and told
them of the time, but they once againe serued him as before. In the end
he met them both in the verie hall doore, and after some timorous
reprehension, of their vncourteous demeanour toward him, he bestowed
either thrée angels or foure more vpon each of them, wherevpon they
promised peremptorilie to speake earnestlie in his cause. And yet for
all this, one of them hauing not yet sucked enough, vtterlie deceiued
him: the other in déed came in, and wagging a scroll which he had in his
hand before the iudge, he spake not aboue thrée or foure words, almost
so soone vttered as a good morrow, and so went from the bar, and this
was all the poore man gat for his monie, and the care which his
counsellours did séeme to take of his cause, then standing vpon the
<span class="leftnote">Manie of our lawiers stoope not at small fées.</span>
hazard. But inough of these matters, for if I should set downe how little law poore
men can haue for their small fées in these daies, and the great
murmurings that are on all sides vttered against their excessiue taking
of monie (for they can abide no small gaine) I should extend this
treatise into a farre greater volume than is conuenient for my purpose.
Wherfore it shall suffice to haue set downe so much of their demeanour,
and so much as is euen enough to cause them to looke with somewhat more
conscience into their dealings, except they be dull and senselesse.</p>

<p>This furthermore is to be noted, that albeit the princes heretofore
reigning in this land haue erected sundrie courts, especiallie of the
chancerie at Yorke and Ludlow, for the ease of poore men dwelling in
<span class="leftnote">Poore men contentious.</span>
those parts, yet will the poorest (of all men commonlie most contentious)
refuse to haue his cause heard so néere home, but indeuoureth rather to
his vtter vndooing to trauell vp to London, thinking there soonest to
preuaile against his aduersarie, though his case be neuer so doubtfull.
But in this toie our Welshmen doo excéed of all that euer I heard, for
you shall here and there haue some one od poore Dauid of them giuen so
much to contention and strife, that without all respect of charges he
will vp to London, though he go bare legged by the waie, and carie his
hosen on his necke (to saue their feet from wearing) bicause he hath no
change. When he commeth there also, he will make such importunate
begging of his countrimen, and hard shift otherwise, that he will
sometimes carie downe six or seuen writs with him in his pursse,
wherewith to molest his neighbor, though the greatest quarrel be
scarselie worth the fee that he hath paid for anie one of them. But
inough of this, least in reuealing the superfluous follie of a few
brablers in this behalfe, I bring no good will to my selfe amongst the
<span class="rightnote">Promoters séeke matters to set lawiers on worke withall.</span>
wisest of that nation. Certes it is a lamentable case to sée
furthermore, how a number of poore men are dailie abused and vtterlie
<span class="page"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[Page 305]</span>
vndoone, by sundrie varlets that go about the countrie, as promoters or
brokers betwéene the pettie foggers of the lawe, and the common people,
onelie to kindle and espie coales of contention, whereby the one side
may reape commoditie, and the other spend and be put to trauell. But of
all that euer I knew in Essex, Denis and Mainford excelled, till Iohn of
Ludlow, aliàs Mason came in place, vnto whome in comparison they two
were but children: for this last in lesse than thrée or foure yeares,
did bring one man (among manie else-where in other places) almost to
extreame miserie (if beggerie be the vttermost) that before he had the
shauing of his beard, was valued at two hundred pounds (I speake with
the least) and finallie feeling that he had not sufficient wherwith to
susteine himselfe and his familie, and also to satisfie that greedie
rauenour, which still called vpon him for new fées, he went to bed, and
within foure daies made an end of his wofull life, euen with care and
pensiuenesse. After his death also he so handled his sonne, that there
was neuer shéepe shorne in Maie, so néere clipped of his fléece present,
as he was of manie to come: so that he was compelled to let awaie his
land, bicause his cattell &amp; stocke were consumed, and he no longer able
to occupie the ground. But hereof let this suffice, &amp; in stéed of these
enormities, a table shall follow of the termes conteining their
beginnings and endings, as I haue borrowed them from my fréend Iohn
Stow, whose studie is the onelie store house of antiquities in my time,
and he worthie therefore to be had in reputation and honour.</p>
<p>
A man would imagine that the time of the execution of our lawes, being
<span class="leftnote">The times of our termes no hinderance to iustice.</span>
little aboue one quarter, or not fullie a third part of the yeare, and
the appointment of the same to be holden in one place onelie, to wit,
neere London in Westminster, and finallie the great expenses emploied
vpon the same, should be no small cause of the staie and hinderance of
the administration of iustice in this land: but as it falleth out they
prooue great occasions and the staie of much contention. The reasons of
these are soone to be conceiued, for as the broken sleeue dooth hold the
elbow backe, and paine of trauell cause manie to sit at home in quiet;
so the shortnesse of time and feare of delaie dooth driue those
oftentimes to like of peace, who otherwise would liue at strife, and
quickelie be at ods. Some men desirous of gaines would haue the termes
yet made shorter, that more delaie might ingender longer sute; other
would haue the houses made larger, and more offices erected, wherein to
minister the lawes. But as the times of the tearmes are rather too short
than too long by one returne a péece: so if there were smaller roomes
and fowler waies vnto them, they would inforce manie to make pawses
before they did rashlie enter into plée. But sith my purpose is not to
make an ample discourse of these things, it shall suffice to deliuer the
times of the holding of our termes, which insueth after this manner.</p>

fixed and palter not their place of standing. Howbeit some of our

<small>OF PROUISION MADE FOR THE POORE.</small><br />

CHAP. X.</h3>

<p>There is no common-wealth at this daie in Europe, wherin there is not
great store of poore people, and those necessarilie to be relieued by
the welthier sort, which otherwise would starue and come to vtter
<span class="leftnote">Thrée sorts of poore.</span>
confusion. With vs the poore is commonlie diuided into thrée sorts, so
that some are poore by impotencie, as the fatherlesse child, the aged,
blind and lame, and the diseased person that is iudged to be incurable:
the second are poore by casualtie, as the wounded souldier, the decaied
householder, and the sicke person visited with grieuous and painefull
diseases: the third consisteth of thriftlesse poore, as the riotour that
hath consumed all, the vagabund that will abide no where, but runneth vp
and downe from place to place (as it were séeking worke and finding
none) and finallie the roge and strumpet which are not possible to be
diuided in sunder, but runne too and fro ouer all the realme, chéefelie
kéeping the champaine soiles in summer to auoid the scorching heat, and
the woodland grounds in winter to eschew the blustering winds.</p>

<p>For the first two sorts, that is to saie, the poore by impotencie, and
the poore by casualtie, which are the true poore in deed, and for whome
the word dooth bind vs to make some dailie prouision: there is order
taken through out euerie parish in the realme, that weekelie collection
<span class="page"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[Page 308]</span>
shall be made for their helpe and sustentation, to the end they should
not scatter abroad, and by begging here and there annoie both towne and
countrie. Authoritie also is giuen vnto the iustices in euerie countie,
and great penalties appointed for such as make default, to sée that the
intent of the statute in this behalfe be trulie executed, according to
the purpose and meaning of the same, so that these two sorts are
sufficientlie prouided for: and such as can liue within the limits of
their allowance (as each one will doo that is godlie and well disposed)
may well forbeare to rome and range about. But if they refuse to be
supported by this benefit of the law, and will rather indeuour by going
to and fro to mainteine their idle trades, then are they adiudged to be
parcell of the third sort, and so in stéed of courteous refreshing at
home, are often corrected with sharpe execution, and whip of iustice
abroad. Manie there are, which notwithstanding the rigor of the lawes
prouided in that behalfe, yéeld rather with this libertie (as they call
it) to be dailie vnder the feare and terrour of the whip, than by
abiding where they were borne or bred, to be prouided for by the
deuotion of the parishes. I found not long since a note of these latter
sort, the effect whereof insueth. Idle beggers are such either through
other mens occasion, or through their owne default. By other mens
<span class="leftnote">A thing often séene.</span>
occasion (as one waie for example) when some couetous man such I meane
as haue the cast or right veine, dailie to make beggers inough wherby to
pester the land, espieng a further commoditie in their commons, holds,
and tenures, dooth find such meanes as thereby to wipe manie out of
their occupiengs, and turne the same vnto his priuate gaines. Herevpon
<span class="leftnote">At whose hands shall the bloud of these men be required?</span>
it followeth, that although the wise and better minded, doo either
forsake the realme for altogether, and seeke to liue in other countries,
as France, Germanie, Barbarie, India, Moscouia, and verie Calecute,
complaining of no roome to be left for them at home, doo so behaue
themselues that they are worthilie to be accompted among the second
sort: yet the greater part commonlie hauing nothing to staie vpon are
wilfull, and therevpon doo either prooue idle beggers, or else continue
starke théeues till the gallowes doo eat them vp, which is a lamentable
case. Certes in some mans iudgements these things are but trifles, and
not worthie the regarding. Some also doo grudge at the great increase of
people in these daies, thinking a necessarie brood of cattell farre
better than a superfluous augmentation of mankind. But I can liken such
men best of all vnto the pope and the diuell, who practise the
hinderance of the furniture of the number of the elect to their
vttermost, to the end the authoritie of the one vpon earth, the
deferring of the locking vp of the other in euerlasting chaines, and the
great gaines of the first may continue and indure the longer. But if it
should come to passe that any forren inuasion should be made, which the
Lord God forbid for his mercies sake! then should these men find that a
wall of men is farre better than stackes of corne and bags of monie, and
complaine of the want when it is too late to séeke remedie. The like
occasion caused the Romans to deuise their law Agraria: but the rich not
liking of it, and the couetous vtterlie condemning it as rigorous and
vnprofitable, neuer ceased to practise disturbance till it was quite
abolished. But to proceed with my purpose.</p>

<p>Such as are idle beggers through their owne default are of two sorts,
and continue their estates either by casuall or méere voluntarie meanes:
those that are such by casuall means, are in the beginning iustlie to be
referred either to the first or second sort of poore afore mentioned:
but degenerating into the thriftlesse sort, they doo what they can to
continue their miserie, and with such impediments as they haue to straie
and wander about, as creatures abhorring all labour and euerie honest
exercise. Certes I call these casuall meanes, not in respect of the
originall of their pouertie, but of the continuance of the same, from
whence they will not be deliuered, such is their owne vngratious
lewdnesse, and froward disposition. The voluntarie meanes proceed from
outward causes, as by making of corosiues, and applieng the same to the
more fleshie parts of their bodies: and also laieng of ratsbane,
sperewort, crowfoot, and such like vnto their whole members, thereby to
raise pitifull and odious sores, and mooue the harts of the goers by
such places where they lie, to yerne at their miserie, and therevpon
bestow large almesse vpon them. How artificiallie they beg, what
forcible spéech, and how they select and choose out words of vehemencie,
<span class="page"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[Page 309]</span>
whereby they doo in maner coniure or adiure the goer by to pitie their
cases, I passe ouer to remember, as iudging the name of God and Christ
to be more conuersant in the mouths of none: and yet the presence of the
heuenlie maiestie further off from no men than from this vngratious
companie. Which maketh me to thinke that punishment is farre meeter for
them than liberalitie or almesse, and sith Christ willeth vs cheeflie to
haue a regard to himselfe and his poore members.</p>
<p>
Vnto this nest is another sort to be referred, more sturdie than the
rest, which hauing sound and perfect lims, doo yet notwithstanding
sometime counterfeit the possession of all sorts of diseases. Diuerse
times in their apparell also they will be like seruing men or laborers:
oftentimes they can plaie the mariners, and séeke for ships which they
neuer lost. But in fine, they are all théeues and caterpillers in the
common-wealth, and by the word of God not permitted to eat, sith they
doo but licke the sweat from the true labourers browes, &amp; beereue the
godlie poore of that which is due vnto them, to mainteine their excesse,
consuming the charitie of well disposed people bestowed vpon them, after
a most wicked &amp; detestable maner.</p>

<p>It is not yet full thréescore yeares since this trade began: but how it
hath prospered since that time, it is easie to iudge, for they are now
supposed of one sex and another, to amount vnto aboue 10000 persons; as
I haue heard reported. Moreouer, in counterfeiting the Egyptian roges,
they haue deuised a language among themselues, which they name Canting,
but other pedlers French, a speach compact thirtie yeares since of
English, and a great number of od words of their owne deuising, without
all order or reason: and yet such is it as none but themselues are able
to vnderstand. The first deuiser thereof was hanged by the necke, a iust
reward no doubt for his deserts, and a common end to all of that
<span class="leftnote">Thomas Harman.</span>
profession. A gentleman also of late hath taken great paines to search
out the secret practises of this vngratious rable. And among other
things he setteth downe and describeth thrée &amp; twentie sorts of them,
whose names it shall not be amisse to remember, wherby ech one may take
occasion to read and know as also by his industrie what wicked people
they are, and what villanie remaineth in them.</p>

<p>The punishment that is ordeined for this kind of people is verie sharpe,
and yet it can not restreine them from their gadding: wherefore the end
must néeds be martiall law, to be exercised vpon them, as vpon théeues,
robbers, despisers of all lawes, and enimies to the common-wealth &amp;
welfare of the land. What notable roberies, pilferies, murders, rapes,
and stealings of yoong children, burning, breaking and disfiguring their
lims to make them pitifull in the sight of the people, I need not to
rehearse: but for their idle roging about the countrie, the law
ordeineth this maner of correction. The roge being apprehended,
committed to prison, and tried in the next assises (whether they be of
<span class="page"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[Page 310]</span>
gaole deliuerie or sessions of the peace) if he happen to be conuicted
for a vagabond either by inquest of office, or the testimonie of two
honest and credible witnesses vpon their oths, he is then immediatlie
adiudged to be gréeuouslie whipped and burned through the gristle of the
right eare, with an hot iron of the compasse of an inch about, as a
manifestation of his wicked life, and due punishment receiued for the
same. And this iudgement is to be executed vpon him, except some honest
person woorth fiue pounds in the quéenes books in goods, or twentie
shillings in lands, or some rich housholder to be allowed by the
iustices, will be bound in recognisance to reteine him in his seruice
for one whole yeare. If he be taken the second time, and proued to haue
forsaken his said seruice, he shall then be whipped againe, bored
likewise through the other eare and set to seruice: from whence if he
depart before a yeare be expired, and happen afterward to be attached
againe, he is condemned to suffer paines of death as a fellon (except
before excepted) without benefit of clergie or sanctuarie, as by the
statute dooth appeare. Among roges and idle persons finallie, we find to
be comprised all proctors that go vp and downe with counterfeit
licences, coosiners, and such as gad about the countrie, vsing vnlawfull
games, practisers of physiognomie and palmestrie, tellers of fortunes,
fensers, plaiers, minstrels, iugglers, pedlers, tinkers, pretensed
schollers, shipmen, prisoners gathering for fees, and others so oft as
they be taken without sufficient licence. From among which companie our
bearewards are not excepted, and iust cause: for I haue read that they
haue either voluntarilie, or for want of power to master their sauage
beasts, béene occasion of the death and deuoration of manie children in
sundrie countries by which they haue passed, whose parents neuer knew
what was become of them. And for that cause there is &amp; haue béene manie
sharpe lawes made for bearwards in Germanie, wherof you may read in
other. But to our roges. Each one also that harboreth or aideth them
with meat or monie, is taxed and compelled to fine with the quéenes
maiestie for euerie time that he dooth so succour them, as it shall
please the iustices of peace to assigne, so that the taxation excéed not
twentie shillings, as I haue béene informed. And thus much of the poore,
&amp; such prouision as is appointed for them within the realme of England.</p>

<small>OF SUNDRIE KINDS OF PUNISHMENTS APPOINTED FOR MALEFACTORS.</small><br />

CHAP. XI.</h3>

<p>In cases of felonie, manslaghter, roberie, murther, rape, piracie, &amp;
such capitall crimes as are not reputed for treason or hurt of the
estate, our sentence pronounced vpon the offendor is to hang till he be
dead. For of other punishments vsed in other countries we haue no
knowledge or vse, and yet so few gréeuous crimes committed with vs as
else where in the world. To vse torment also or question by paine and
torture in these common cases with vs is greatlie abhorred, sith we are
found alwaie to be such as despise death, and yet abhorre to be
tormented, choosing rather frankelie to open our minds than to yeeld our
bodies vnto such seruile halings and tearings as are vsed in other
countries. And this is one cause wherefore our condemned persons doo go
so chéerefullie to their deths, for our nation is frée, stout, hautie,
prodigall of life and bloud, as sir Thomas Smith saith lib. 2. cap. 25.
de republica, and therefore cannot in anie wise digest to be vsed as
villanes and slaues, in suffering continuallie beating, seruitude, and
seruile torments. No, our gailers are guiltie of fellonie by an old law
of the land, if they torment anie prisoner committed to their custodie
for the reuealing of his complices.</p>

<p>The greatest and most gréeuous punishment vsed in England, for such as
offend against the state, is drawing from the prison to the place of
execution vpon an hardle or sled, where they are hanged till they be
halfe dead, and then taken downe and quartered aliue, after that their
members and bowels are cut from their bodies, and throwne into a fire
prouided neere hand and within their owne sight, euen for the same
purpose. Sometimes, if the trespasse be not the more hainous, they are
<span class="page"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[Page 311]</span>
suffered to hang till they be quite dead. And when soeuer anie of the
nobilitie are conuicted of high treason by their peeres, that is to
saie, equals (for an inquest of yeomen passeth not vpon them, but onelie
of the lords of the parlement) this maner of their death is conuerted
into the losse of their heads onelie, notwithstanding that the sentence
doo run after the former order. In triall of cases concerning treason,
fellonie, or anie other greeuous crime not confessed, the partie accused
dooth yéeld, if he be a noble man, to be tried by an inquest (as I haue
said) and his péeres: if a gentleman, by gentlemen: and an inferiour, by
God and by the countrie, to wit, the yeomanrie (for combat or battell is
not greatlie in vse) and being condemned of fellonie, manslaughter, &amp;c:
he is eftsoons hanged by the necke till he be dead, and then cut downe
and buried. But if he be conuicted of wilfull murther, doone either vpon
pretended malice, or in anie notable robberie, he is either hanged aliue
in chaines néere the place where the fact was committed (or else vpon
compassion taken first strangled with a rope) and so continueth till his
bones consume to nothing. We haue vse neither of the whéele nor of the
barre, as in other countries; but when wilfull manslaughter is
perpetrated, beside hanging, the offendor hath his right hand commonlie
striken off before or néere vnto the place where the act was doone,
after which he is led foorth to the place of execution, and there put to
death according to the law.</p>

<p>The word fellon is deriued of the Saxon words Fell and One, that is to
say, an euill and wicked one, a one of vntamable nature, and lewdnesse
not to be suffered for feare of euill example and the corruption of
others. In like sort in the word fellonie are manie gréeuous crimes
conteined, as breach of prison An. 1 of Edward the second. Disfigurers
of the princes liege people An. 5. of Henrie the fourth. Hunting by
night with painted faces and visors An. 1. of Henrie the seuenth. Rape
or stealing of women &amp; maidens An. 3 of Henrie the eight. Conspiracie
against the person of the prince An. 3. of Henrie the seuenth.
Embesilling of goods committed by the master to the seruant, aboue the
value of fourtie shillings An. 17. of Henrie the eight. Carieng of
horsses or mares into Scotland An. 23. of Henrie the eight. Sodomie and
buggerie An. 25. of Henrie the eight. Stealing of hawkes egs An. 31. of
Henrie the eight. Coniuring, sorcerie, witchcraft, and digging vp of
crosses An. 33. of Hen. 8. Prophesieng vpon armes, cognisances, names &amp;
badges An. 33. of Hen. 8. Casting of slanderous bils An. 37. Hen. 8.
Wilfull killing by poison An. 1. of Edw. the sixt. Departure of a
soldier from the field An. 2. of Edward the sixt. Diminution of coine,
all offenses within case of premunire, embeselling of records, goods
taken from dead men by their seruants, stealing of what soeuer cattell,
robbing by the high waie, vpon the sea, or of dwelling houses, letting
out of ponds, cutting of pursses, stealing of déere by night,
counterfeiters of coine, euidences, charters, and writings, &amp; diuerse
other needlesse to be remembred. If a woman poison hir husband she is
burned aliue, if the seruant kill his master he is to be executed for
petie treason, he that poisoneth a man is to be boiled to death in water
or lead, although the partie die not of the practise: in cases of
murther all the accessaries are to suffer paines of death accordinglie.
Periurie is punished by the pillorie, burning in the forehead with the
letter P, the rewalting of the trées growing vpon the grounds of the
offenders and losse of all his mooueables. Manie trespasses also are
punished by the cutting of one or both eares from the head of the
offendor, as the vtterance of seditious words against the magistrates,
fraimakers, petie robbers, &amp;c. Roges are burned through the eares,
cariers of sheepe out of the land by the losse of their hands, such as
kill by poison are either boiled or skalded to death in lead or séething
water. Heretikes are burned quicke, harlots and their mates by carting,
ducking, and dooing of open penance in shéets, in churches and market
stéeds are often put to rebuke. Howbeit as this is counted with some
either as no punishment at all to speake of, or but smallie regarded of
the offendors, so I would wish adulterie and fornication to haue some
sharper law. For what great smart is it to be turned out of an hot sheet
into a cold, or after a little washing in the water to be let lose
againe vnto their former trades? Howbeit the dragging of some of them
<span class="page"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[Page 312]</span>
ouer the Thames betwéene Lambeth and Westminster at the taile of a boat,
is a punishment that most terrifieth them which are condemned therto;
but this is inflicted vpon them by none other than the knight marshall,
and that within the compasse of his iurisdiction &amp; limits onelie.
Canutus was the first that gaue authoritie to the cleargie to punish
whoredome, who at that time found fault with the former lawes as being
too seuere in this behalfe. For before the time of the said Canutus, the
adulterer forfeited all his goods to the king, and his bodie to be at
his pleasure; and the adulteresse was to lose hir eies or nose, or both,
if the case were more than common: whereby it appéereth of what
estimation mariage was amongst them, sith the breakers of that holie
estate were so gréeuouslie rewarded. But afterward the cleargie dealt
more fauourablie with them, shooting rather at the punishments of such
priests and clearkes as were maried, than the reformation of adulterie
and fornication, wherein you shall find no example that anie seueritie
was shewed, except vpon such laie men as had defiled their nuns. As in
theft therefore so in adulterie and whoredome I would wish the parties
trespassant, to be made bond or slaues vnto those that receiued the
iniurie, to sell and giue where they listed, or to be condemned to the
gallies: for that punishment would proue more bitter to them than halfe
an houres hanging, or than standing in a shéet, though the weather be
neuer so cold.</p>

<p>Manslaughter in time past was punished by the pursse, wherin the
quantitie or qualitie of the punishment was rated after the state and
calling of the partie killed: so that one was valued sometime at 1200,
another at 600, or 200 shillings. And by an estatute made vnder Henrie
the first, a citizen of London at 100, whereof else-where I haue spoken
more at large. Such as kill themselues are buried in the field with a
stake driuen through their bodies.</p>

<p>Witches are hanged or sometimes burned, but théeues are hanged (as I
<span class="leftnote">Halifax law.</span>
said before) generallie on the gibbet or gallowes, sauing in Halifax
where they are beheaded after a strange maner, and whereof I find this
report. There is and hath beene of ancient time a law or rather a
custome at Halifax, that who soeuer dooth commit anie fellonie, and is
taken with the same, or confesse the fact vpon examination: if it be
valued by foure constables to amount to the sum of thirtéene pence halfe
penie, he is foorthwith beheaded vpon one of the next market daies
(which fall vsuallie vpon the tuesdaies, thursdaies, &amp; saturdaies) or
else vpon the same daie that he is so conuicted, if market be then
holden. The engine wherewith the execution is doone, is a square blocke
of wood of the length of foure foot and an halfe, which dooth ride vp
and downe in a slot, rabet, or regall betwéene two péeces of timber,
that are framed and set vpright of fiue yardes in height. In the neather
end of the sliding blocke is an ax keied or fastened with an iron into
the wood, which being drawne vp to the top of the frame is there
fastened by a woodden pin (with a notch made into the same after the
maner of a Samsons post) vnto the middest of which pin also there is a
long rope fastened that commeth downe among the people, so that when the
offendor hath made his confession, and hath laid his necke ouer the
neathermost blocke, euerie man there present dooth either take hold of
the rope (or putteth foorth his arme so neere to the same as he can get,
in token that he is willing to sée true iustice executed) and pulling
out the pin in this maner, the head blocke wherein the ax is fastened
dooth fall downe with such a violence, that if the necke of the
transgressor were so big as that of a bull, it should be cut in sunder
at a stroke, and roll from the bodie by an huge distance. If it be so
that the offendor be apprehended for an ox, oxen, shéepe, kine, horsse,
or anie such cattell: the selfe beast or other of the same kind shall
haue the end of the rope tied somewhere vnto them, so that they being
driuen doo draw out the pin wherby the offendor is executed. Thus much
of Halifax law, which I set downe onelie to shew the custome of that
countrie in this behalfe.</p>

<p>Roges and vagabonds are often stocked and whipped, scolds are ducked
<span class="leftnote">Mute.</span>
vpon cucking-stooles in the water. Such fellons as stand mute and speake
not at their arraignement are pressed to death by huge weights laid vpon
a boord, that lieth ouer their brest, and a sharpe stone vnder their
backs, and these commonlie hold their peace, thereby to saue their goods
<span class="page"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[Page 313]</span>
vnto their wiues and children, which if they were condemned should be
confiscated to the prince. Théeues that are saued by their bookes and
<span class="leftnote">Cleargie.</span>
cleargie, for the first offense, if they haue stollen nothing else but
oxen, shéepe, monie, or such like, which be no open robberies, as by the
high waie side, or assailing of anie mans house in the night, without
putting him in feare of his life, or breaking vp of his wals or doores,
are burned in the left hand, vpon the brawne of the thombe with an hot
iron, so that if they be apprehended againe, that marke bewraieth them
to haue beene arraigned of fellonie before, whereby they are sure at
that time to haue no mercie. I doo not read that this custome of sauing
by the booke is vsed anie where else than in England, neither doo I find
(after much diligent inquirie) what Saxon prince ordeined that law.
Howbeit, this I generallie gather thereof, that it was deuised to traine
the inhabiters of this land to the loue of learning, which before
contemned letters and all good knowledge, as men onelie giuing
themselues to husbandrie and the warres, the like whereof I read to haue
beene amongst the Gothes and Vandals, who for a time would not suffer
euen their princes to be lerned for weakening of their courages, nor
anie learned men to remaine in the counsell house, but by open
proclamation would command them to auoid, whensoeuer anie thing touching
<span class="leftnote">Pirats.</span>
the state of the land was to be consulted vpon. Pirats and robbers by
sea are condemned in the court of the admeraltie, and hanged on the
shore at lowe water marke, where they are left till three tides haue
ouerwashed them. Finallie, such as hauing wals and banks néere vnto the
sea, and doo suffer the same to decaie (after conuenient admonition)
whereby the water entereth and drowneth vp the countrie, are by a
certeine ancient custome apprehended, condemned, and staked in the
breach, where they remaine for euer as parcell of the foundation of the
new wall that is to be made vpon them, as I haue heard reported.</p>

<p>And thus much in part of the administration of iustice vsed in our
countrie, wherein notwithstanding that we doo not often heare of
horrible, merciles, and wilfull murthers (such I meane as are not
sildome séene in the countries of the maine) yet now and then some
manslaughter and bloudie robberies are perpetrated and committed,
contrarie to the lawes, which be seuerelie punished, and in such wise as
I before reported. Certes there is no greater mischéefe doone in England
than by robberies, the first by yoong shifting gentlemen, which
oftentimes doo beare more port than they are able to mainteine.
Secondlie by seruingmen, whose wages cannot suffice so much as to find
them bréeches, wherefore they are now and then constreined either to
kéepe high waies, and breake into the wealthie mens houses with the
first sort, or else to walke vp and downe in gentlemens and rich farmers
pastures, there to sée and view which horsses féed best, whereby they
manie times get something, although with hard aduenture it hath béene
knowne by their confession at the gallowes, that some one such chapman
hath had fortie, fiftie, or sixtie stolne horsses at pasture here and
there abroad in the countrie at a time, which they haue sold at faires
and markets farre off, they themselues in the meane season being taken
about home for honest yeomen, and verie wealthie drouers, till their
dealings haue been bewraied. It is not long since one of this companie
was apprehended, who was before time reputed for a verie honest and
wealthie townesman, he vttered also more horsses than anie of his trade,
because he sold a reasonable peniworth, and was a faire spoken man. It
was his custome likewise to saie, if anie man hucked hard with him about
the price of a gelding; So God helpe me gentleman or sir, either he did
cost me so much, or else by Iesus I stole him. Which talke was plaine
inough, and yet such was his estimation, that each beleeued the first
part of his tale, and made no account of the later, which was the truer
indéed.</p>
<p>
Our third annoiers of the common-wealth are roges, which doo verie great
mischeefe in all places where they become. For wheras the rich onelie
suffer iniurie by the first two, these spare neither rich nor poore: but
whether it be great gaine or small, all is fish that commeth to net with
them, and yet I saie both they and the rest are trussed vp apace. For
there is not one yeare commonlie, wherein thrée hundred or four hundred
of them are not deuoured and eaten vp by the gallowes in one place and
other. It appeareth by Cardane (who writeth it vpon the report of the
<span class="page"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[Page 314]</span>
bishop of Lexouia) in the geniture of king Edward the sixt, how Henrie
the eight, executing his laws verie seuerelie against such idle persons,
I meane great théeues, pettie théeues and roges, did hang vp thréescore
and twelue thousand of them in his time. He seemed for a while greatlie
to haue terrified the rest: but since his death the number of them is so
increased, yea although we haue had no warres, which are a great
occasion of their breed (for it is the custome of the more idle sort,
hauing once serued or but séene the other side of the sea vnder colour
of seruice to shake hand with labour, for euer, thinking it a disgrace
for himselfe to returne vnto his former trade) that except some better
order be taken, or the lawes alreadie made be better executed, such as
dwell in vplandish townes and little villages shall liue but in small
safetie and rest. For the better apprehension also of theeues and
mankillers, there is an old law in England verie well prouided, whereby
it is ordered, that if he that is robbed, or any man complaine and giue
warning of slaughter or murther committed, the constable of the village
wherevnto he commeth and crieth for succour, is to raise the parish
about him, and to search woods, groues, and all suspected houses and
places, where the trespasser may be, or is supposed to lurke; and not
finding him there, he is to giue warning vnto the next constable, and so
one constable after serch made to aduertise another from parish to
parish, till they come to the same where the offender is harbored and
found. It is also prouided, that if anie parish in this businesse doo
not hir dutie, but suffereth the théefe (for the auoiding of trouble
sake) in carrieng him to the gaile, if he should be apprehended, or
other letting of their worke, to escape the same parish, is not onlie to
make fine to the king, but also the same with the whole hundred wherein
it standeth, to repaie the partie robbed his damages, and leaue his
estate harmlesse. Certes this is a good law, howbeit I haue knowne by
mine owne experience, fellons being taken to haue escaped out of the
stocks, being rescued by other for want of watch &amp; gard, that théeues
haue beene let passe, bicause the couetous and greedie parishoners would
neither take the paines, nor be at the charge to carrie them to prison,
if it were far off, that when hue and crie haue béene made euen to the
faces of some constables, they haue said; "God restore your losse, I
haue other businesse at this time." And by such meanes the meaning of
manie a good law is left vnexecuted, malefactors imboldened, and manie a
poore man turned out of that which he hath swet and taken great paines
for, toward the maintenance of himselfe and his poore children and
familie.</p>

<small>OF THE MANER OF BUILDING AND FURNITURE OF OUR HOUSES.</small><br />

CHAP. XII.</h3>

<p>The greatest part of our building in the cities and good townes of
England consisteth onelie of timber, for as yet few of the houses of the
communaltie (except here &amp; there in the West countrie townes) are made
of stone, although they may (in my opinion) in diuerse other places be
builded so good cheape of the one as of the other. In old time the
houses of the Britons were slightlie set vp with a few posts &amp; many
radels, with stable and all offices vnder one roofe, the like whereof
almost is to be séene in the fennie countries and northerne parts vnto
this daie, where for lacke of wood they are inforced to continue this
ancient maner of building. It is not in vaine therefore in speaking of
building to make a distinction betwéene the plaine and wooddie soiles:
for as in these, our houses are commonlie strong and well timbered, so
that in manie places, there are not aboue foure, six, or nine inches
betwéene stud and stud; so in the open and champaine countries they are
inforced for want of stuffe to vse no studs at all, but onlie franke
posts, raisins, beames, prickeposts, groundsels, summers (or dormants)
transoms, and such principals, with here and there a griding, whervnto
they fasten their splints or radels, and then cast it all ouer with
thicke claie to keepe out the wind, which otherwise would annoie them.
Certes this rude kind of building made the Spaniards in quéene Maries
<span class="page"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[Page 315]</span>
daies to woonder, but chéeflie when they saw what large diet was vsed in
manie of these so homelie cottages, in so much that one of no small
reputation amongst them said after this maner: "These English (quoth he)
haue their houses made of sticks and durt, but they fare commonlie so
well as the king." Whereby it appeareth that he liked better of our good
fare in such course cabins, than of their owne thin diet in their
princelike habitations and palaces. In like sort as euerie countrie
house is thus apparelled on the out side, so is it inwardlie diuided
into sundrie roomes aboue and beneath; and where plentie of wood is,
they couer them with tiles, otherwise with straw, sedge, or reed, except
some quarrie of slate be néere hand, from whence they haue for their
monie so much as may suffice them.</p>

<p>The claie wherewith our houses are impanelled is either white, red, or
blue, and of these the first dooth participat verie much with the nature
of our chalke, the second is called lome, but the third eftsoones
changeth colour so soone as it is wrought, notwithstanding that it looke
blue when it is throwne out of the pit. Of chalke also we haue our
excellent Asbestos or white lime, made in most places, wherewith being
quenched we strike ouer our claie workes and stone wals, in cities, good
townes, rich farmers and gentlemens houses: otherwise in steed of chalke
(where it wanteth for it is so scant that in some places it is sold by
the pound) they are compelled to burne a certeine kind of red stone, as
in Wales, and else where other stones and shels of oisters and like fish
found vpon the sea coast, which being conuerted into lime doth
naturallie (as the other) abhorre and eschew water whereby it is
dissolued, and neuerthelesse desire oile wherewith it is easilie mixed,
as I haue seene by experience. Within their doores also such as are of
abilitie doo oft make their floores and parget of fine alabaster burned,
which they call plaster of Paris, whereof in some places we haue great
plentie, and that verie profitable against the rage of fire.</p>

<p>In plastering likewise of our fairest houses ouer our heads, we vse to
laie first a laine or two of white morter tempered with haire vpon
laths, which are nailed one by another (or sometimes vpon reed or
wickers more dangerous for fire, and made fast here and there with
saplaths for falling downe) and finallie couer all with the aforesaid
plaster, which beside the delectable whitenesse of the stuffe it selfe,
is laied on so euen and smoothlie, as nothing in my iudgment can be
doone with more exactnesse. The wals of our houses on the inner sides in
like sort be either hanged with tapisterie, arras worke, or painted
cloths, wherin either diuerse histories, or hearbes, beasts, knots, and
such like are stained, or else they are seeled with oke of our owne, or
wainescot brought hither out of the east countries, whereby the roomes
are not a little commended, made warme, and much more close than
otherwise they would be. As for stooues we haue not hitherto vsed them
greatlie, yet doo they now begin to be made in diuerse houses of the
gentrie and wealthie citizens, who build them not to worke and feed in
as in Germanie and else where, but now and then to sweat in, as occasion
and néed shall require. This also hath béene common in England,
contrarie to the customes of all other nations, and yet to be séene (for
example in most stréets of London) that many of our greatest houses haue
outwardlie béene verie simple and plaine to sight, which inwardlie haue
beene able to receiue a duke with his whole traine, and lodge them at
their ease. Hereby moreouer it is come to passe, that the fronts of our
stréets haue not béene so vniforme and orderlie builded as those of
forreine cities, where (to saie truth) the vtterside of their mansions
and dwellings haue oft more cost bestowed vpon them, than all the rest
of the house, which are often verie simple and vneasie within, as
experience dooth confirme. Of old time our countrie houses in steed of
glasse did vse much lattise and that made either of wicker or fine rifts
of oke in chekerwise. I read also that some of the better sort, in and
before the times of the Saxons (who notwithstanding vsed some glasse
also since the time of Benedict Biscop the moonke that brought the feat
of glasing first into this land) did make panels of horne in stéed of
glasse, &amp; fix them in woodden calmes. But as horne in windows is now
quite laid downe in euerie place, so our lattises are also growne into
<span class="page"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[Page 316]</span>
lesse vse, bicause glasse is come to be so plentifull, and within a
verie little so good cheape if not better then the other.</p>

<p>I find obscure mention of the specular stone also to haue béene found
and applied to this vse in England, but in such doubtfull sort as I dare
not affirme it for certeine. Neuerthelesse certeine it is that
antiquitie vsed it before glasse was knowen, vnder the name of
Selenites. And how glasse was first found I care not greatlie to
remember euen at this present, although it be directlie beside my
purposed matter. In Syria phenices which bordereth vpon Iurie, &amp; néere
to the foot of mount Carmell there is a moore or marris, wherout riseth
a brooke called somtime Belus, and falleth into the sea néere to
Ptolemais. This riuer was fondlie ascribed vnto Baall, and also honored
vnder that name by the infidels, long time before there was anie king in
Israell. It came to passe also as a certeine merchant sailed that way
loden with Nitrum, the passengers went to land for to repose themselues,
and to take in some store of fresh water into their vessell. Being also
on the shore they kindled a fire, and made prouision for their dinner,
but bicause they wanted treuets or stones whereon to set their kettels
on, ran by chance into the ship, and brought great péeces of Nitrum with
him, which serued their turne for that present. To be short, the said
substance being hot, and beginning to melt, it mixed by chance with the
grauel that laie vnder it; and so brought forth that shining substance
which now is called glasse, and about the time of Semiramis. When the
companie saw this, they made no small accompt of their successe, and
foorthwith began to practise the like in other mixtures, whereby great
varietie of the said stuffe did also insue. Certes for the time this
historie may well be true: for I read of glasse in Iob, but for the rest
I refer me to the common opinion conceiued by writers. Now to turne
againe to our windowes. Heretofore also the houses of our princes and
noble men were often glased with Berill (an example whereof is yet to be
séene in Sudleie castell) and in diuerse other places with fine
christall, but this especiallie in the time of the Romans, wherof also
some fragments haue béene taken vp in old ruines. But now these are not
in vse, so that onelie the clearest glasse is most estéemed: for we haue
diuerse sorts, some brought out of Burgundie, some out of Normandie,
much out of Flanders, beside that which is made in England, which would
be so good as the best, if we were diligent and carefull to bestow more
cost vpon it, and yet as it is, each one that may, will haue it for his
building. Moreouer the mansion houses of our countrie townes and
villages (which in champaine ground stand altogither by stréets, &amp;
ioining one to an other, but in woodland soiles dispersed here and
there, each one vpon the seuerall grounds of their owners) are builded
in such sort generallie, as that they haue neither dairie, stable, nor
bruehouse annexed vnto them vnder the same roofe (as in manie places
beyond the sea &amp; some of the north parts of our countrie) but all
separate from the first, and one of them from an other. And yet for all
this, they are not so farre distant in sunder, but that the goodman
lieng in his bed may lightlie heare what is doone in each of them with
ease, and call quicklie vnto his meinie if anie danger should attach
him.</p>

<p>The ancient manours and houses of our gentlemen are yet and for the most
part of strong timber, in framing whereof our carpenters haue beene and
are worthilie preferred before those of like science among all other
nations. Howbeit such as be latelie builded, are c&#333;monlie either of
bricke or hard stone, or both; their roomes large and comelie, and
houses of office further distant from their lodgings. Those of the
nobilitie are likewise wrought with bricke and hard stone, as prouision
may best be made: but so magnificent and statelie, as the basest house
of a baron dooth often match in our daies with some honours of princes
in old time. So that if euer curious building did florish in England, it
is in these our yeares, wherin our workemen excell, and are in maner
comparable in skill with old Vitruuius, Leo Baptista, and Serlo.
Neuerthelesse, their estimation more than their gréedie and seruile
couetousnesse, ioined with a lingering humour causeth them often to be
rejected, &amp; strangers preferred to greater bargaines, who are more
reasonable in their takings, and lesse wasters of time by a great deale
than our owne.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[Page 317]</span></p>

<p>The furniture of our houses also exceedeth, and is growne in maner euen
to passing delicacie: and herein I doo not speake of the nobilitie and
gentrie onelie, but likewise of the lowest sort in most places of our
south countrie, that haue anie thing at all to take to. Certes in noble
mens houses it is not rare to sée abundance of Arras, rich hangings of
tapistrie, siluer vessell, and so much other plate, as may furnish
sundrie cupbords, to the summe oftentimes of a thousand or two thousand
pounds at the least: whereby the value of this and the rest of their
stuffe dooth grow to be almost inestimable. Likewise in the houses of
knights, gentlemen, merchantmen, and some other wealthie citizens, it is
not geson to behold generallie their great prouision of tapistrie,
Turkie worke, pewter, brasse, fine linen, and thereto costlie cupbords
of plate, worth fiue or six hundred or a thousand pounds, to be deemed
by estimation. But as herein all these sorts doo far excéed their elders
and predecessors, and in neatnesse and curiositie, the merchant all
other; so in time past, the costlie furniture staied there, whereas now
it is descended yet lower, euen vnto the inferiour artificers and manie
farmers, who by vertue of their old and not of their new leases haue for
the most part learned also to garnish their cupbords with plate, their
ioined beds with tapistrie and silke hangings, and their tables with
carpets &amp; fine naperie, whereby the wealth of our countrie (God be
praised therefore, and giue vs grace to imploie it well) dooth
infinitelie appeare. Neither doo I speake this in reproch of anie man,
God is my iudge, but to shew that I do reioise rather, to sée how God
hath blessed vs with his good gifts; and whilest I behold how that in a
time wherein all things are growen to most excessiue prices, &amp; what
commoditie so euer is to be had, is dailie plucked from the communaltie
by such as looke into euerie trade, we doo yet find the means to obtein
&amp; atchiue such furniture as heretofore hath beene vnpossible. There are
old men yet dwelling in the village where I remaine, which haue noted
<span class="leftnote">Thrée things greatlie amended in England.</span>
three things to be maruellouslie altered in England within their sound
remembrance; &amp; other three things too too much increased. One is, the
<span class="rightnote">Chimnies.</span>
multitude of chimnies latelie erected, wheras in their yoong daies there
were not aboue two or thrée, if so manie in most vplandish townes of the
realme (the religious houses, &amp; manour places of their lords alwaies
excepted, and peraduenture some great personages) but ech one made his
fire against a reredosse in the hall, where he dined and dressed his
meat.</p>

<p>The second is the great (although not generall) amendment of lodging,
for (said they) our fathers (yea and we our selues also) haue lien full
<span class="leftnote">Hard lodging.</span>
oft vpon straw pallets, on rough mats couered onelie with a shéet vnder
couerlets made of dagswain or hopharlots (I vse their owne termes) and a
good round log vnder their heads in steed of a bolster or pillow. If it
were so that our fathers or the good man of the house, had within seuen
yeares after his mariage purchased a matteres or flockebed, and thereto
a sacke of chaffe to rest his head vpon, he thought himselfe to be as
well lodged as the lord of the towne, that peraduenture laie seldome in
a bed of downe or whole fethers; so well were they contented, and with
such base kind of furniture: which also is not verie much amended as yet
in some parts of Bedfordshire, and elsewhere further off from our
southerne parts. Pillowes (said they) were thought méet onelie for women
in childbed. As for seruants, if they had anie shéet aboue them it was
well, for seldome had they anie vnder their bodies, to kéepe them from
the pricking straws that ran oft through the canuas of the pallet, and
rased their hardened hides.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Furniture of household.</span>
The third thing they tell of, is the exchange of vessell, as of treene
platters into pewter, and wodden spoones into siluer or tin. For so
common were all sorts of tréene stuffe in old time, that a man should
hardlie find foure péeces of pewter (of which one was peraduenture a
<span class="rightnote">This was in the time of generall idlenesse.</span>
salt) in a good farmers house, and yet for all this frugalitie (if it
may so be iustly called) they were scarse able to liue and paie their
rents at their daies without selling of a cow, or an horsse, or more,
although they paid but foure pounds at the vttermost by the yeare. Such
also was their pouertie, that if some one od farmer or husbandman had
béene at the alehouse, a thing greatlie vsed in those daies, amongst six
or seuen of his neighbours, and there in a brauerie to shew what store
he had, did cast downe his pursse, and therein a noble or six shillings
in siluer vnto them (for few such men then cared for gold bicause it was
<span class="page"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[Page 318]</span>
not so readie paiment, and they were oft inforced to giue a penie for
the exchange of an angell) it was verie likelie that all the rest could
not laie downe so much against it: whereas in my time, although
peraduenture foure pounds of old rent be improued to fortie, fiftie, or
an hundred pounds, yet will the farmer as another palme or date trée
thinke his gaines verie small toward the end of his terme, if he haue
not six or seuen yeares rent lieng by him, therewith to purchase a new
lease, beside a faire garnish of pewter on his cupbord, with so much
more in od vessell going about the house, thrée or foure featherbeds, so
manie couerlids and carpets of tapistrie, a siluer salt, a bowle for
wine (if not an whole neast) and a dozzen of spoones to furnish vp the
sute. This also he taketh to be his owne cléere, for what stocke of
monie soeuer he gathereth &amp; laieth vp in all his yeares, it is often
séene, that the landlord will take such order with him for the same,
when he renueth his lease, which is commonlie eight or six yeares before
the old be expired (sith it is now growen almost to a custome, that if
he come not to his lord so long before, another shall step in for a
reuersion, and so defeat him out right) that it shall neuer trouble him
more than the haire of his beard, when the barber hath washed and shauen
it from his chin. And as they commend these, so (beside the decaie of
housekéeping whereby the poore haue beene relieued) they speake also of
thrée things that are growen to be verie grieuous vnto them, to wit, the
inhansing of rents, latelie mentioned; the dailie oppression of
copiholders, whose lords séeke to bring their poore tenants almost into
plaine seruitude and miserie, dailie deuising new meanes, and séeking vp
all the old how to cut them shorter and shorter, doubling, trebling, and
now &amp; then seuen times increasing their fines, driuing them also for
euerie trifle to loose and forfeit their tenures (by whome the greatest
part of the realme dooth stand and is mainteined) to the end they may
fléece them yet more, which is a lamentable hering. The third thing they
talke of is vsurie, a trade brought in by the Iewes, now perfectlie
practised almost by euerie christian, and so commonlie that he is
accompted but for a foole that dooth lend his monie for nothing. In time
past it was "Sors pro sorte," that is, the principall onelie for the
principall; but now beside that which is aboue the principall properlie
called "Vsura," we chalenge "F&oelig;nus," that is commoditie of soile, &amp;
fruits of the earth, if not the ground it selfe. In time past also one
of the hundred was much, from thence it rose vnto two, called in Latine
"Vsura, Ex sextante;" thrée, to wit "Ex quadrante;" then to foure, to
wit "Ex triente;" then to fiue, which is "Ex quincunce;" then to six,
called "Ex semisse," &amp;c: as the accompt of the "Assis" ariseth, and
comming at the last vnto "Vsura ex asse," it amounteth to twelue in the
hundred, and therefore the Latines call it "Centesima," for that in the
hundred moneth it doubleth the principall; but more of this elsewhere.
See Cicero against Verres, Demosthenes against Aphobus, and Athenæus
lib. 13. in fine: and when thou hast read them well, helpe I praie thée
in lawfull maner to hang vp such as take "Centu&#363; pro cento," for they
<span class="leftnote">By the yeare.</span>
are no better worthie as I doo iudge in conscience. Forget not also such
landlords as vse to value their leases at a secret estimation giuen of
the wealth and credit of the taker, whereby they séeme (as it were) to
eat them vp and deale with bondmen, so that if the leassée be thought to
be worth an hundred pounds, he shall paie no lesse for his new terme, or
else another to enter with hard and doubtfull couenants. I am sorie to
report it, much more gréeued to vnderstand of the practise; but most
sorowfull of all to vnderstand that men of great port and countenance
are so farre from suffering their farmers to haue anie gaine at all,
that they themselues become grasiers, butchers, tanners, shéepmasters,
woodmen, and "denique quid non," thereby to inrich themselues, and bring
all the wealth of the countrie into their owne hands, leauing the
communaltie weake, or as an idoll with broken or féeble armes, which may
in a time of peace haue a plausible shew, but when necessitie shall
inforce, haue an heauie and bitter sequele.</p>

<small>OF CITIES AND TOWNES IN ENGLAND.</small><br />

CAP. XIII.</h3>

<p><span class="leftnote">Six and twentie cities in England.</span>
As in old time we read that there were eight and twentie flamines and
archflamines in the south part of this Ile, and so manie great cities
vnder their iurisdiction: so in these our daies there is but one or two
fewer, and each of them also vnder the ecclesiasticall regiment of some
one bishop or archbishop, who in spirituall cases haue the charge and
ouersight of the same. So manie cities therefore are there in England
and Wales, as there be bishopriks &amp; archbishopriks. For notwithstanding
that Lichfield and Couentrie, and Bath and Welles, doo séeme to extend
the aforesaid number vnto nine and twentie: yet neither of these couples
are to be accounted, but as one entier citie and sée of the bishop, sith
one bishoprike can haue relation but vnto one sée, and the said see be
situate but in one place, after which the bishop dooth take his name. It
appeareth by our old and ancient histories, that the cities of this
southerlie portion haue beene of excéeding greatnesse and beautie,
whereof some were builded in the time of the Samotheans, and of which
not a few in these our times are quite decaied, and the places where
they stood worne out of all remembrance. Such also for the most part as
yet remaine are maruellouslie altered, insomuch that whereas at the
first they were large and ample, now are they come either vnto a verie
few houses, or appeare not to be much greater in comparison than poore &amp;
simple villages. Antoninus the most diligent writer of the thorough
fares of Britaine, noteth among other these ancient townes following, as
<span class="leftnote">Sitomagus.</span>
Sitomagus, which he placeth in the waie from Norwich, as Leland
<span class="rightnote">Nouiomagus.</span>
supposeth (wherin they went by Colchester) to London, Nouiomagus that
lieth betwéene Carleill and Canturburie, within ten miles east of
<span class="leftnote">Neomagus.<br />
Niomagus.</span>
London, and likewise Neomagus and Niomagus which take their names of
their first founder Magus, the sonne of Samothes, &amp; second king of the
Celtes that reigned in this Iland; and not "A profunditate," onelie, as
Bodinus affirmeth out of Plinie, as if all the townes that ended in
Magus should stand in holes and low grounds: which is to be disprooued
in diuerse cities in the maine, as also here with vs. Of these moreouer
sir Thomas Eliot supposeth Neomagus to haue stood somewhere about
Chester; &amp; George Lillie in his booke of the names of ancient places,
iudgeth Niomagus to be the verie same that we doo now call Buckingham,
and lieth farre from the shore. And as these and sundrie other now
perished tooke their denomination of this prince, so there are diuerse
<span class="leftnote">Salisburie of Sarron.</span>
causes, which mooue me to coniecture, that Salisburie dooth rather take
the first name of Sarron the sonne of the said Magus, than of Cæsar,
Caradoc or Seuerus (as some of our writers doo imagine) or else at the
least wise of Salisburge of the maine, from whence some Saxons came to
inhabit in this land. And for this later not vnlikelie, sith before the
comming of the Saxons, the king of the Suessionenses had a great part of
this Iland in subiection, as Cæsar saith; and in another place that such
of Belgie as stale ouer hither from the maine, builded and called
<span class="leftnote">Sarronium.<br />
Sarronsburg.</span>
diuerse cities after the names of the same from whence they came, I
meane such as stood vpon the coast, as he himselfe dooth witnesse. But
sith coniectures are no verities, and mine opinion is but one mans
iudgement, I will not stand now vpon the proofe of this matter, least I
should séeme to take great paines in adding new coniectures vnto old, in
such wise to deteine the heads of my readers about these trifles, that
otherwise peraduenture would be farre better occupied in matters of more
importance. To procéed therefore. As soone after the first inhabitation
of this Iland, our cities began no doubt to be builded and increased, so
they ceased not to multiplie from time to time, till the land was
throughlie furnished with hir conuenient numbers, whereof some at this
present with their ancient names, doo still remaine in knowledge, though
diuerse be doubted of, and manie more perished by continuance of time,
<span class="leftnote">Greater cities in times past when husbandmen
also were citizens.</span>
and violence of the enimie. I doubt not also but the least of these were
comparable to the greatest of those which stand in our time, for sith
that in those daies the most part of the Iland was reserued vnto
pasture, the townes and villages either were not at all (but all sorts
<span class="page"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[Page 320]</span>
of people dwelled in the cities indifferentlie, an image of which estate
may yet be seene in Spaine) or at the lestwise stood not so thicke, as
<span class="leftnote">The cause of the increase of villages.</span>
they did afterward in the time of the Romans, but chéefelie after the
comming of the Saxons, and after them the Normans, when euerie lord
builded a church neare vnto his owne mansion house, and thereto imparted
the greatest portion of his lands vnto sundrie tenants, to hold the same
of him by coppie of court roll, which rolles were then kept in some
especiall place indifferentlie appointed by them and their lord, so that
the one could haue no resort vnto them without the other, by which means
the number of townes and villages was not a little increased. If anie
man be desirous to know the names of those ancient cities, that stood in
the time of the Romans, he shall haue them here at hand, in such wise as
I haue gathered them out of our writers, obseruing euen their manner of
writing of them so neare as to me is possible, without alteration of
anie corruption crept vp into the same.</p>

<p>As for Cair Dorme (another whereof I read likewise) it stood somewhere
vpon the Nene in Huntingdon shire, but now vnknowne, sith it was twise
raced to the ground, first by the Saxons, then by the Danes, so that the
ruines thereof are in these daies not extant to be séene. And in like
sort I am ignorant where most of them stood, that are noted with the
star. I find in like sort mention of a noble citie called Alcluid ouer
and beside these afore mentioned, sometime builded by Ebracus of
Britaine, as the fame goeth, and finallie destroied by the Danes, about
the yeare of Grace 870. It stood vpon the banks of the riuer Cluda, to
wit, betwéene it and the blanke on the north, and the Lound lake on the
west, and was sometime march betwéene the Britons and the Picts, and
likewise the Picts and the Scots; neuerthelesse, the castell (as I
heare) dooth yet remaine, and hath béene since well repared by the
Scots, and called Dombrittain or Dunbritton, so that it is not an hard
matter by these few words to find where Alcluid stood. I could here, if
leisure serued, and hast of the printer not require dispatch, deliuer
the ancient names of sundrie other townes, of which Stafford in time
past was called Stadtford, and therfore (as I gesse) builded or the name
altered by the Saxons, Kinebanton now Kimbalton. But if anie man be
desirous to sée more of them, let him resort to Houeden in the life of
Henrie the second, and there he shall be further satisfied of his desire
in this behalfe.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">When Albane was martyred Asclepiodotus was legat in Britaine.</span>
It should séeme when these ancient cities flourished, that the same
towne, which we now call saint Albons, did most of all excell: but
chéefelie in the Romans time, and was not onelie nothing inferior to
London it selfe, but rather preferred before it, bicause it was newer,
and made a Municipium of the Romans, whereas the other was old and
ruinous, and inhabited onelie by the Britons, as the most part of the
Iland was also in those daies. Good notice hereof also is to be taken by
Matthew Paris, and others before him, out of whose writings I haue
thought good to note a few things, whereby the maiestie of this ancient
citie may appeare vnto posteritie, and the former estate of Verlamcester
<span class="page"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[Page 322]</span>
not lie altogither (as it hath doone hitherto) raked vp in forgetfulnes,
through the negligence of such as might haue deserued better of their
successours, by leauing the description thereof in a booke by it selfe,
sith manie particulars thereof were written to their hands, that now are
lost and perished. Tacitus in the fouretéenth booke of his historie
maketh mention of it, shewing that in the rebellion of the Britons, the
Romans there were miserablie distressed, "Eadem clades" (saith he)
"municipio Verolamio fuit." And here vpon Nennius in his catalog of
<span class="leftnote">Sullomaca and Barnet all one, or not far in sunder.</span>
cities calleth it Cair municip, as I before haue noted. Ptolome speaking
of it, dooth place it among the Catyeuchlanes, but Antoninus maketh it
one and twentie Italian miles from London, placing Sullomaca nine mile
from thence, whereby it is euident, that Sullomaca stood néere to
Barnet, if it were not the verie same. Of the old compasse of the walles
of Verolamium there is now small knowledge to be had by the ruines, but
of the beautie of the citie it selfe you shall partlie vnderstand by
that which followeth at hand, after I haue told you for your better
intelligence what "Municipium Romanorum" is: for there is great
difference betwéene that and "Colonia Romanorum," sith "Colonia aliò
traducitur a ciuitate Roma," but "Municipes aliundè in ciuitatem
veniunt, suísq; iuribus &amp; legibus viuunt:" moreouer their soile is not
changed into the nature of the Romane, but they liue in the stedfast
fréendship and protection of the Romans, as did somtime the Ceretes who
were the first people which euer obteined that priuilege. The British
Verolamians therefore, hauing for their noble seruice in the warres
deserued great commendations at the hands of the Romans, they gaue vnto
them the whole fréedome of Romans, whereby they were made Municipes, and
became more frée in truth than their Colonies could be. To conclude
therefore, Municipium is a citie infranchised and indued with Romane
priuileges, without anie alteration of hir former inhabitants or
priuileges; whereas a Colonie is a companie sent from Rome into anie
other region or prouince, to possesse either a citie newlie builded, or
to replenish the same from whence hir former citizens haue beene
expelled and driuen out. Now to proceed.</p>

<p>In the time of king Edgar it fell out, that one Eldred was abbat there;
who being desirous to inlarge that house, it came into his mind to
search about in the ruines of Verolamium (which now was ouerthrowne by
the furie of the Saxons &amp; Danes) to sée if he might there come by anie
curious peeces of worke, wherewith to garnish his building taken in
hand. To be short, he had no sooner begun to dig among the rubbis, but
he found an excéeding number of pillers, péeces of antike worke,
thresholds, doore frames, and sundrie other péeces of fine masonrie for
windowes and such like, verie conuenient for his purpose. Of these also
some were of porphyrite stone, some of diuerse kinds of marble, touch,
and alabaster, beside manie curious deuises of hard mettall, in finding
whereof he thought himselfe an happie man, and his successe to be
greatlie guided by S. Albane. Besides these also he found sundrie
pillers of brasse, and sockets of latton, alabaster and touch, all which
he laid aside by great heaps, determining in the end (I saie) to laie
the foundation of a new abbaie, but God so preuented his determination,
that death tooke him awaie, before his building was begun. After him
succéeded one Eadmerus, who followed the dooings of Eldred to the
vttermost: and therefore not onlie perused what he had left with great
diligence, but also caused his pioners to search yet further, within the
old walles of Verolamium, where they not onelie found infinite other
péeces of excellent workemanship, but came at the last to certeine
vaults vnder the ground, in which stood diuers idols, and not a few
altars, verie superstitiouslie and religiouslie adorned, as the pagans
left them belike in time of necessitie. These images were of sundrie
mettals, and some of pure gold, their altars likewise were richlie
couered, all which ornaments Edmerus tooke awaie, and not onelie
conuerted them to other vse in his building, but also destroied an
innumerable sort of other idols, whose estimation consisted in their
formes, and substances could doo no seruise. He tooke vp also sundrie
curious pots, iugs, and cruses of stone and wood most artificiallie
wrought and carued, and that in such quantitie, besides infinite store
of fine houshold stuffe, as if the whole furniture of the citie had
béene brought thither of purpose to be hidden in those vaults. In
procéeding further, he tooke vp diuerse pots of gold, siluer, brasse,
<span class="page"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[Page 323]</span>
glasse and earth, whereof some were filled with the ashes and bones of
the gentils, the mouths being turned downewards (the like of which, but
of finer earth, were found in great numbers also of late in a well at
little Massingham in Norffolke, of six or eight gallons a péece, about
the yeare 1578, and also in the time of Henrie the eight) and not a few
with the coines of the old Britons and Romane emperours. All which
vessels the said abbat brake into péeces, and melting the mettall, he
reserued it in like sort for the garnishing of his church.</p>

<p>He found likewise in a stone wall two old bookes, whereof one contained
the rites of the gentils, about the sacrifices of their gods, the other
<span class="leftnote">This soundeth like a lie.</span>
(as they now saie) the martyrdome of saint Albane, both of them written
in old Brittish letters, which either bicause no man then liuing could
read them, or for that they were not woorth the keeping, were both
consumed to ashes, sauing that a few notes were first taken out of this
later, concerning the death of their Albane. Thus much haue I thought
good to note of the former beautie of Verolamium, whereof infinite other
tokens haue beene found since that time, and diuerse within the memorie
of man, of passing workemanship, the like whereof hath no whers else
béene séene in anie ruines within the compasse of this Ile, either for
cost or quantitie of stuffe.</p>

<p>Furthermore, whereas manie are not afraid to saie that the Thames came
sometimes by this citie, indeed it is nothing so; but that the Verlume
(afterward called Vere and the Mure) did and dooth so still (whatsoeuer
Gildas talketh hereof, whose books may be corrupted in that behalfe)
there is yet euident proofe to be confirmed by experience. For albeit
that the riuer be now growne to be verie small by reason of the ground
about it, which is higher than it was in old time; yet it kéepeth in
maner the old course, and runneth betwéene the old citie that was, and
the new towne that is standing on Holmehirst crag, as I beheld of late.
Those places also which now are medow beneath the abbaie, were sometimes
a great lake, mere, or poole, through which the said riuer ran, and (as
I read) with a verie swift and violent course, wheras at this present it
is verie slow, and of no such deapth as of ancient times it hath beene.
But heare what mine author saith further of the same. As those aforsaid
workemen digged in these ruines, they happened oftentimes vpon Lempet
shels, péeces of rustie anchors, and keeles of great vessels, wherevpon
some by and by gathered that either the Thames or some arme of the sea
did beat vpon that towne, not vnderstanding that these things might
aswell happen in great lakes and meres, wherof there was one adioining
to the north side of the citie, which laie then (as some men thinke)
vnwalled, but that also is false. For being there vpon occasion this
summer passed, I saw some remnant of the old wals standing in that
place, which appeared to haue béene verie substantiallie builded; the
ruines likewise of a greater part of them are to be séene running along
by the old chappell hard by in maner of a banke. Whereby it is euident
that the new towne standeth cleane without the limits of the old, and
that the bridge whereof the historie of S. Albane speaketh, was at the
nether end of Halliwell stréet or there about, for so the view of the
place doth inforce me to coniecture. This mere (which the Latine copie
of the description of Britaine, written of late by Humfrey Lhoid our
countrie man calleth corruptlie "Stagnum enaximum" for "Stagnum
maximum") at the first belonged to the king, and thereby Offa in his
time did reape no small commoditie. It continued also vntill the time of
Alfrijc the seuenth abbat of that house, who bought it outright of the
king then liuing, and by excessiue charges drained it so narrowlie, that
within a while he left it drie (sauing that he reserued a chanell for
the riuer to haue hir vsuall course, which he held vp with high bankes)
bicause there was alwaies contention betwéene the moonks and the kings
seruants, which fished on that water vnto the kings behoofe.</p>

<p>In these daies therefore remaineth no maner mention of this poole, but
onelie in one stréet, which yet is called Fishpoole stréet, wherof this
may suffice for the resolution of such men, as séeke rather to yéeld to
an inconuenience, than that their Gildas should séeme to mistake this
riuer.</p>

<p>Hauing thus digressed to giue some remembrance of the old estate of
Verolamium, it is now time to returne againe vnto my former purpose.
Certes I would gladlie set downe with the names and number of the
cities, all the townes and villages in England and Wales, with their
<span class="page"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[Page 324]</span>
true longitudes and latitudes, but as yet I cannot come by them in such
order as I would: howbeit the tale of our cities is soone found by the
bishoprikes, sith euerie sée hath such prerogatiue giuen vnto it, as to
beare the name of a citie, &amp; to vse Regale ius within hir owne limits.
Which priuilege also is granted to sundrie ancient townes in England,

<p>Whose particular plots and models with their descriptions shall insue,
if it may be brought to passe, that the cutters can make dispatch of
them before this chronologie be published. Of townes and villages
likewise thus much will I saie, that there were greater store in old
time (I meane within three or foure hundred yeare passed) than at this
present. And this I note out of diuerse records, charters, and donations
(made in times past vnto sundrie religious houses, as Glassenburie,
Abbandon, Ramseie, Elie, and such like) and whereof in these daies I
find not so much as the ruines. Leland in sundrie places complaineth
likewise of the decaie of parishes in great cities and townes, missing
in some six, or eight, or twelue churches and more, of all which he
giueth particular notice. For albeit that the Saxons builded manie
townes and villages, and the Normans well more at their first comming,
yet since the first two hundred yeares after the latter conquest, they
haue gone so fast againe to decaie, that the ancient number of them is
verie much abated. Ranulph the moonke of Chester telleth of generall
surueie made in the fourth, sixtéenth, &amp; nineteenth of the reigne of
William Conquerour, surnamed the Bastard, wherein it was found, that
(notwithstanding the Danes had ouerthrowne a great manie) there were to
the number of 52000 townes, 45002 parish churches, and 75000 knights
fées, whereof the cleargie held 28015. He addeth moreouer that there
were diuerse other builded since that time, within the space of an
hundred yeares after the comming of the Bastard, as it were in lieu or
recompense of those that William Rufus pulled downe for the erection of
his new forrest. For by an old booke which I haue, and sometime written
as it séemeth by an vndershiriffe of Nottingham, I find, euen in the
time of Edw. 4. 45120 parish churches, and but 60216 knights fées,
whereof the cleargie held as before 28015, or at the least 28000: for so
small is the difference which he dooth séeme to vse. Howbeit if the
assertions of such as write in our time concerning this matter, either
are or ought to be of anie credit in this behalfe, you shall not find
aboue 17000 townes and villages, and 9210 in the whole, which is little
more than a fourth part of the aforesaid number, if it be throughlie
scanned.</p>

<p>Certes this misfortune hath not onelie happened vnto our Ile &amp; nation,
but vnto most of the famous countries of the world heretofore, and all
by the gréedie desire of such as would liue alone and onelie to
themselues. And hereof we may take example in Candie of old time called
Creta, which (as Homer writeth) was called Hecatompolis, bicause it
conteined an hundred cities, but now it is so vnfurnished that it may
hardlie be called Tripolis. Diodorus Siculus saith, that Aegypt had once
18000 cities, which so decaied in processe of time, that when Ptolomeus
Lagus reigned, there were not aboue 3000: but in our daies both in all
Asia &amp; Aegypt this lesser number shall not verie readilie be found. In
time past in Lincolne (as the fame goeth) there haue beene two and
fiftie parish churches, and good record appeareth for eight and thirtie:
but now if there be foure and twentie it is all. This inconuenience hath
growen altogither to the church by appropriations made vnto monasteries
and religious houses, a terrible canker and enimie to religion.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[Page 325]</span></p>

<p>But to leaue this lamentable discourse of so notable and gréeuous an
inconuenience, growing (as I said) by incroching and ioining of house to
house, and laieng land to land, whereby the inhabitants of manie places
of our countrie are deuoured and eaten vp, and their houses either
altogither pulled downe or suffered to decaie by litle and litle,
although sometime a poore man peraduenture dooth dwell in one of them,
who not being able to repare it, suffereth it to fall downe, &amp; thereto
thinketh himselfe verie friendlie dealt withall, if he may haue an acre
of ground assigned vnto him whereon to kéepe a cow, or wherein to set
cabbages, radishes, parsneps, carrets, melons, pompons, or such like
stuffe, by which he and his poore household liueth as by their
principall food, sith they can doo no better. And as for wheaten bread,
they eat it when they can reach vnto the price of it, contenting
themselues in the meane time with bread made of otes or barleie: a poore
estate God wot! Howbeit what care our great incrochers? But in diuers
places where rich men dwelled sometime in good tenements, there be now
no houses at all, but hopyards, and sheads for poles, or peraduenture
gardens, as we may sée in castell Hedingham, and diuerse other places.
But to procéed.</p>

<p>It is so, that our soile being diuided into champaine ground and
woodland, the houses of the first lie vniformelie builded in euerie
towne togither with stréets and lanes, wheras in the woodland countries
(except here and there in great market townes) they stand scattered
abroad, each one dwelling in the midst of his owne occupieng. And as in
manie and most great market townes, there are commonlie thrée hundred or
foure hundred families or mansions, &amp; two thousand communicants, or
peraduenture more: so in the other, whether they be woodland or
champaine, we find not often aboue fortie, fiftie, or thrée score
households, and two or thrée hundred communicants, whereof the greatest
part neuerthelesse are verie poore folkes, oftentimes without all maner
of occupieng, sith the ground of the parish is gotten vp into a few mens
hands, yea sometimes into the tenure of one, two or thrée, whereby the
rest are compelled either to be hired seruants vnto the other, or else
to beg their bread in miserie from doore to doore.</p>

<p>There are some (saith Leland) which are not so fauourable when they haue
gotten such lands, as to let the houses remaine vpon them to the vse of
the poore; but they will compound with the lord of the soile to pull
them downe for altogither, saieng that if they did let them stand, they
should but toll beggers to the towne, therby to surcharge the rest of
the parish, &amp; laie more burden vpon them. But alas these pitifull men
sée not that they themselues hereby doo laie the greatest log vpon their
neighbors necks. For sith the prince dooth commonlie loose nothing of
his duties accustomable to be paid, the rest of the parishioners that
remaine must answer and beare them out: for they plead more charge other
waies, saieng; I am charged alreadie with a light horsse, I am to answer
in this sort and after that maner. And it is not yet altogither out of
knowledge, that where the king had seuen pounds thirteene shillings at a
taske gathered of fiftie wealthie householders of a parish in England:
now a gentleman hauing three parts of the towne in his owne hands, foure
housholds doo beare all the aforesaid paiment, or else Leland is
deceiued in his Commentaries lib. 13. latelie come to my hands, which
thing he especiallie noted in his trauell ouer this Ile. A common plague
&amp; enormittie, both in the hart of the land and likewise vpon the coasts.
Certes a great number compleine of the increase of pouertie, laieng the
cause vpon God, as though he were in fault for sending such increase of
people, or want of wars that should consume them, affirming that the
land was neuer so full, &amp;c: but few men doo sée the verie root from
whence it dooth procéed. Yet the Romans found it out, when they
florished, and therefore prescribed limits to euerie mans tenure and
occupieng. Homer commendeth Achilles for ouerthrowing of fiue and
twentie cities: but in mine opinion Ganges is much better preferred by
Suidas for building of thrée score in Inde, where he did plant himselfe.
I could (if néed required) set downe in this place the number of
religious houses and monasteries, with the names of their founders that
haue béene in this Iland: but sith it is a thing of small importance, I
passe it ouer as impertinent to my purpose. Yet herein I will commend
<span class="page"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[Page 326]</span>
sundrie of the monasticall votaries, especiallie moonkes, for that they
were authors of manie goodlie borowes and endwares, néere vnto their
dwellings, although otherwise they pretended to be men separated from
the world. But alas their couetous minds one waie in inlarging their
reuenues, and carnall intent an other, appéered herin too too much. For
being bold from time to time to visit their tenants, they wrought off
great wickednesse, and made those endwares little better than
brodelhouses, especiallie where nunries were farre off, or else no safe
accesse vnto them. But what doo I spend my time in the rehearsall of
these filthinesses? Would to God the memorie of them might perish with
the malefactors! My purpose was also at the end of this chapter to haue
set downe a table of the parish churches and market townes thorough out
all England and Wales: but sith I can not performe the same as I would,
I am forced to giue ouer my purpose: yet by these few that insue you
shall easilie see what order I would haue vsed according to the shires,
if I might haue brought it to passe.</p>

<small>OF CASTELS AND HOLDS.</small><br />

CHAP. XIV.</h3>

<p>It hath béene of long time a question in controuersie, and not yet
determined, whether holds and castels néere cities or anie where in the
hart of common-wealths, are more profitable or hurtfull for the benefit
of the countrie? Neuertheles it séemeth by our owne experience that we
here in England suppose them altogither vnnéedfull. This also is
apparent by the testimonie of sundrie writers, that they haue béene the
ruine of manie a noble citie. Of Old Salisburie I speake not, of Anwarpe
I saie nothing more than of sundrie other, whereof some also in my time
neuer cease to incroch vpon the liberties of the cities adioining,
thereby to hinder them what and wherin they may. For my part I neuer
read of anie castell that did good vnto the citie abutting theron, but
onelie the capitoll of Rome: and yet but once good vnto the same, in
respect of the nine times whereby it brought it into danger of vtter
ruine and confusion. Aristotle vtterlie denieth that anie castle at all
can be profitable to a common wealth well gouerned. Timotheus of
Corinthum affirmeth, that a castle in a common wealth is but a bréeder
of tyrants. Pyrhus king of Epire being receiued also on a time into
<span class="page"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[Page 327]</span>
Athens, among other courtesies shewed vnto him, they led him also into
their castell of Pallas, who at his departure gaue them great thanks for
the fréendlie intertainment; but with this item, that they should let so
few kings come into the same as they might, least (saith he) they teach
you to repent too late of your great gentlenesse. Caietanus in his
common-wealth hath finallie no liking of them, as appéereth in his eight
booke of that most excellent treatise. But what haue I to deale whether
they be profitable or not, sith my purpose is rather to shew what
plentie we haue of them, which I will performe so far as shall be
néedfull?</p>

<p>There haue béene in times past great store of castels and places of
defense within the realme of England, of which some were builded by the
Britons, manie by the Romans, Saxons, and Danes, but most of all by the
barons of the realme, in &amp; about the time of king Stephan, who licenced
each of them to build so manie as them listed vpon their owne demeasnes,
hoping thereby that they would haue imploied their vse to his aduantage
and commoditie. But finallie when he saw that they were rather fortified
against himselfe in the end, than vsed in his defense, he repented all
too late of his inconsiderate dealing, sith now there was no remedie but
by force for to subdue them. After his decease king Henrie the second
came no sooner to the crowne, but he called to mind the inconuenience
which his predecessour had suffered, and he himselfe might in time
sustaine by those fortifications. Therefore one of the first things he
did was an attempt to race and deface the most part of these holds.
Certes he thought it better to hazard the méeting of the enimie now and
then in the plaine field, than to liue in perpetuall feare of those
houses, and the rebellion of his lords vpon euerie light occasion
conceiued, who then were full so strong as he, if not more strong; and
that made them the readier to withstand and gainesaie manie of those
procéedings, which he and his successours from time to time intended.
Herevpon therefore he caused more than eleuen hundred of their said
castels to be raced and ouerthrowne, whereby the power of his nobilitie
was not a little restreined. Since that time also, not a few of those
which remained haue decaied, partlie by the commandement of Henrie the
third, and partlie of themselues, or by conuersion of them into the
dwelling houses of noble men, their martiall fronts being remooued: so
that at this present, there are verie few or no castels at all
mainteined within England, sauing onelie vpon the coasts and marches of
the countrie for the better kéeping backe of the forren enimie, when
soeuer he shall attempt to enter and annoie vs.</p>

<p>The most provident prince that euer reigned in this land, for the
fortification thereof against all outward enimies, was the late prince
of famous memorie king Henrie the eight, who beside that he repared most
of such as were alreadie standing, builded sundrie out of the ground.
For hauing shaken off the more than seruile yoke of popish tyrannie, and
espieng that the emperour was offended for his diuorce from quéene
Catharine his aunt, and thereto vnderstanding that the French king had
coupled the Dolphin his sonne with the popes neece, and maried his
daughter to the king of Scots (whereby he had cause more iustlie to
suspect than safelie to trust anie one of them all as Lambert saith) he
determined to stand vpon his owne defense, and therefore with no small
spéed, and like charge, he builded sundrie blockehouses, castels, and
platformes vpon diuerse frontiers of his realme, but chieflie the east
and southeast parts of England, whereby (no doubt) he did verie much
qualifie the conceiued grudges of his aduersaries, and vtterlie put off
their hastie purpose of inuasion. But would to God he had cast his eie
toward Harwich, and the coasts of Norffolke and Suffolke, where nothing
as yet is doone! albeit there be none so fit and likelie places for the
enimie to enter vpon, as in those parts, where, at a full sea they may
touch vpon the shore and come to land without resistance. And thus much
brieflie for my purpose at this present. For I néed not to make anie
long discourse of castels, sith it is not the nature of a good
Englishman to regard to be caged vp as in a coope, and hedged in with
stone wals, but rather to meet with his enimie in the plaine field at
handstrokes, where he maie trauaise his ground, choose his plot, and vse
the benefit of sunne shine, wind and weather, to his best aduantage &amp;
commoditie. Isocrates also saith that towres, walles, bulworkes,
<span class="page"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[Page 328]</span>
<span class="rightnote">The best kéepers of kingdomes.</span>
soldiers, and plentie of armour, are not the best kéepers of kingdomes;
but freends, loue of subiects, &amp; obedience vnto martiall discipline,
which they want that shew themselues either cruell or couetous toward
their people. As for those tales that go of Beston castell, how it shall
saue all England on a daie, and likewise the brag of a rebellious baron
in old time named Hugh Bigot, that said in contempt of king Henrie the
third, and about the fiftith yeare of his reigne:</p>

<p class="ind1">If I were in my castell of Bungeie,<br />
Vpon the water of Waueneie,<br />
I wold not set a button by the king of Cockneie,</p>

<p>I repute them but as toies, the first méere vaine, the second fondlie
vttered if anie such thing were said, as manie other words are and haue
béene spoken of like holds (as Wallingford, &amp;c:) but now growen out of
memorie, and with small losse not heard of among the common sort. Certes
the castell of Bungeie was ouerthrowen by the aforesaid prince, the same
yeare that he ouerthrew the walles and castell of Leircester, also the
castels of Treske and Malesar, apperteining to Roger Mowbraie, and that
of Fremlingham belonging likewise to Hugh Bigot, wherof in the
chronologie following you may read at large. I might here in like sort
take occasion to speake of sundrie strong places where camps of men haue
lien, and of which we haue great plentie here in England in the plaine
fields: but I passe ouer to talke of any such néedlesse discourses. This
neuerthelesse concerning two of them is not to be omitted, to wit, that
<span class="leftnote">The Wandles in time past were called Windles.</span>
the one néere vnto Cambridge now Gogmagogs hill, was called Windleburie
before time, as I read of late in an old pamphlet. And to saie the truth
I haue often heard them named Winterburie hilles, which difference may
easilie grow by corruption of the former word: the place likewise is
verie large and strong. The second is to be séene in the edge of
Shropshire about two miles from Colme, betwéene two riuers, the Clun or
Colunus, and the Tewie otherwise named Themis, wherevnto there is no
accesse but at one place. The Welshmen call it Cair Carador, and they
are of the opinion, that Caractatus king of the Sillures was ouercome
there by Ostorius, at such time as he fled to Cartimanda quéene of the
Brigants for succour, who betraied him to the Romans, as you may sée in
Tacitus.</p>

<h3><a name="d2-cap15" id="d2-cap15"></a>
<small>OF PALACES BELONGING TO THE PRINCE.</small><br />

CHAP. XV.</h3>

<p>It lieth not in me to set down exactlie the number &amp; names of the
palaces belonging to the prince, nor to make anie description of hir
graces court, sith my calling is and hath béene such, as that I haue
scarselie presumed to peepe in at hir gates, much lesse then haue I
aduentured to search out and know the estate of those houses, and what
magnificent behauiour is to be séene within them. Yet thus much will I
saie generallie of all the houses and honours perteining to hir
maiestie, that they are builded either of square stone or bricke, or
else of both. And thervnto although their capacitie and hugenesse be not
so monstrous, as the like of diuerse forren princes are to be seene in
the maine, and new found nations of the world: yet are they so curious,
neat, and commodious as any of them, both for conuenience of offices and
lodgings, and excellencie of situation, which is not the least thing to
be considered of in building. Those that were builded before the time of
<span class="leftnote">King Hen. 8. not inferior to Adrian and Iustinian.</span>
king Henrie the eight, reteine to these daies the shew and image of the
ancient kind of workemanship vsed in this land: but such as he erected
after his owne deuise (for he was nothing inferiour in this trade to
Adrian the emperour and Iustinian the lawgiuer) doo represent another
maner of paterne, which as they are supposed to excell all the rest that
he found standing in this realme, so they are and shall be a perpetuall
president vnto those that doo come after, to follow in their workes and
buildings of importance. Certes masonrie did neuer better flourish in
<span class="page"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[Page 329]</span>
England than in his time. And albeit that in these daies there be manie
goodlie houses erected in the sundrie quarters of this Iland; yet they
are rather curious to the eie like paper worke, than substantiall for
continuance: whereas such as he did set vp excell in both, and therefore
may iustlie be preferred farre aboue all the rest. The names of those
which come now to my remembrance, and are as yet reserued to hir
maiesties onelie vse at pleasure are these: for of such as are giuen
awaie I speake not, neither of those that are vtterlie decaied, as
Bainards castell in London builded in the daies of the Conquerour by a
noble man called William Bainard, whose wife Inga builded the priorie of
litle Donemow in the daies of Henrie the first; neither of the tower
roiall there also, &amp;c: sith I sée no cause wherefore I should remember
them and manie of the like, of whose verie ruines I haue no certeine
knowledge. Of such I saie therfore as I erst mentioned, we haue first of
<span class="leftnote">White hall.</span>
all White hall at the west end of London (which is taken for the most
large &amp; principall of all the rest) was first a lodging of the
Archbishops of Yorke, then pulled downe, begun by cardinall Woolseie,
and finallie inlarged and finished by king Henrie the eight. By east of
this standeth Durham place, sometime belonging to the bishops of Durham,
but conuerted also by king Henrie the eight into a palace roiall, &amp;
lodging for the prince. Of Summerset place I speake not, yet if the
first beginner thereof (I meane the lord Edward, the learned and godlie
duke of Summerset) had liued, I doubt not but it should haue beene well
finished and brought to a sumptuous end: but as vntimelie death tooke
him from that house &amp; from vs all, so it prooued the staie of such
proceeding as was intended about it. Wherby it commeth to passe that it
standeth as he left it. Neither will I remember the Tower of London,
which is rather an armorie and house of munition, and therevnto a place
for the safekéeping of offenders, than a palace roiall for a king or
quéene to soiourne in. Yet in times past I find that Belline held his
aboad there, and therevnto extended the site of his palace in such wise,
that it stretched ouer the Broken wharfe, and came further into the
citie, in so much that it approched néere to Bellines gate, &amp; as it is
thought some of the ruines of his house are yet extant, howbeit patched
<span class="rightnote">S. James.</span>
vp and made warehouses in that tract of ground in our times. S. Iames
sometime a nonrie, was builded also by the same prince. Hir grace hath
<span class="leftnote">Oteland.<br />
Ashridge.<br />
Hatfield.<br />
Enuéeld.<br />
Richmond.<br />
Hampton.<br />
Woodstocke.</span>
also Oteland, Ashridge, Hatfield, Hauering, Enuéeld, Eltham, Langleie,
Richmond builded by Henrie the fift, Hampton court (begun sometime by
cardinall Woolseie, and finished by hir father) and therevnto
Woodstocke, erected by king Henrie the first, in which the quéenes
maiestie delighteth greatlie to soiourne, notwithstanding that in time
past it was the place of a parcell of hir captiuitie, when it pleased
God to trie hir by affliction and calamitie.</p>

<p><span class="rightnote">Windsor.</span>
For strength Windlesor or Winsor is supposed to be the chéefe, a castell
builded in time past by king Arthur, or before him by Aruiragus, as it
is thought, and repared by Edward the third, who erected also a notable
college there. After him diuerse of his successours haue bestowed
excéeding charges vpon the same, which notwithstanding are farre
surmounted by the quéenes maiestie now liuing, who hath appointed huge
summes of monie to be emploied vpon the ornature and alteration of the
mould, according to the forme of building vsed in our daies, which is
more for pleasure than for either profit or safegard. Such also hath
béene the estimation of this place, that diuerse kings haue not onelie
béene interred there, but also made it the chiefe house of assemblie,
and creation of the knights of the honorable order of the garter, than
the which there is nothing in this land more magnificent and statelie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Gréenewich.</span>
Greenewich was first builded by Humfreie duke of Glocester, vpon the
Thames side foure miles east from London, in the time of Henrie the
sixt, and called Pleasance. Afterwards it was greatlie inlarged by king
Edw. 4. garnished by king Hen. 7. and finallie made perfect by king Hen.
8. the onelie Phenix of his time for fine and curious masonrie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Dartford.</span>
Not farre from this is Dartford, and not much distant also from the
southside of the said streame, somtime a nonnerie builded by Edward the
third, but now a verie commodious palace, wherevnto it was also
<span class="rightnote">Eltham.</span>
conuerted by K. Henrie the eight. Eltham (as I take it) was builded by
<span class="page"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[Page 330]</span>
king Henrie the third, if not before. There are beside these moreouer
diuerse other. But what shall I néed to take vpon me to repeat all, and
tell what houses the quéenes maiestie hath? sith all is hirs, and when
it pleaseth hir in the summer season to recreat hir selfe abroad, and
view the estate of the countrie, and heare the complaints of hir poore
commons iniuried by hir vniust officers or their substitutes, euerie
noble mans house is hir palace, where shee continueth during pleasure,
and till shée returne againe to some of hir owne, in which she remaineth
so long as pleaseth hir.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Of the court.</span>
The court of England, which necessarilie is holden alwaies where the
prince lieth, is in these daies one of the most renowmed and magnificent
courts that are to be found in Europe. For whether you regard the rich
and infinit furniture of household, order of officers, or the
interteinement of such strangers as dailie resort vnto the same, you
shall not find manie equall therevnto, much lesse one excelling it in
anie maner of wise. I might here (if I would, or had sufficient
disposition of matter concerned of the same) make a large discourse of
such honorable ports, of such graue councellors, and noble personages,
as giue their dailie attendance vpon the quéenes maiestie there. I could
in like sort set foorth a singular commendation of the vertuous beautie,
or beautifull vertues of such ladies and gentlewomen as wait vpon hir
person, betweene whose amiable countenances and costlinesse of attire,
there séemeth to be such a dailie conflict and contention, as that it is
verie difficult for me to gesse, whether of the twaine shall beare awaie
the preheminence. This further is not to be omitted, to the singular
<span class="leftnote">English courtiers the best learned &amp; the worst liuers.</span>
commendation of both sorts and sexes of our courtiers here in England,
that there are verie few of them, which haue not the vse and skill of
sundrie speaches, beside an excellent veine of writing before time not
regarded. Would to God the rest of their liues and conuersations were
correspondent to these gifts! for as our common courtiers (for the most
part) are the best lerned and indued with excellent gifts, so are manie
of them the worst men when they come abroad, that anie man shall either
heare or read of. Trulie it is a rare thing with vs now, to heare of a
courtier which hath but his owne language. And to saie how many
gentlewomen and ladies there are, that beside sound knowledge of the
Gréeke and Latine toongs, are thereto no lesse skilfull in the Spanish,
Italian, and French, or in some one of them, it resteth not in me: sith
I am persuaded, that as the noble men and gentlemen doo surmount in this
behalfe, so these come verie little or nothing at all behind them for
their parts, which industrie God continue, and accomplish that which
otherwise is wanting!</p>

<p>Beside these things I could in like sort set downe the waies and meanes,
wherby our ancient ladies of the court doo shun and auoid idlenesse,
some of them exercising their fingers with the needle, other in
caulworke, diuerse in spinning of silke, some in continuall reading
either of the holie scriptures, or histories of our owne or forren
nations about vs, and diuerse in writing volumes of their owne, or
translating of other mens into our English and Latine toong, whilest the
yoongest sort in the meane time applie their lutes, citharnes,
prickesong, and all kind of musike, which they vse onelie for recreation
sake, when they haue leisure, and are free from attendance vpon the
quéenes maiestie, or such as they belong vnto. How manie of the eldest
sort also are skilfull in surgerie and distillation of waters, beside
sundrie other artificiall practises perteining to the ornature and
commendations of their bodies, I might (if I listed to deale further in
this behalfe) easilie declare, but I passe ouer such maner of dealing,
least I should séeme to glauer, and currie fauour with some of them.
Neuerthelesse this I will generallie saie of them all, that as ech of
them are cuning in somthing wherby they kéepe themselues occupied in the
court, so there is in maner none of them, but when they be at home, can
helpe to supplie the ordinarie want of the kitchen with a number of
delicat dishes of their owne deuising, wherein the Portingall is their
chéefe counsellor, as some of them are most commonlie with the clearke
of the kitchen, who vseth (by a tricke taken vp of late) to giue in a
bréefe rehearsall of such and so manie dishes as are to come in at
euerie course throughout the whole seruice in the dinner or supper
while: which bill some doo call a memoriall, other a billet, but some a
<span class="page"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[Page 331]</span>
fillet, bicause such are commonlie hanged on the file, and kept by the
ladie or gentlewoman vnto some other purpose. But whither am I
digressed?</p>

<p>I might finallie describe the large allowances in offices, and yearelie
liueries, and therevnto the great plentie of gold and siluer plate, the
seuerall peeces whereof are commonlie so great and massie, and the
quantitie therof so abundantlie seruing all the houshold, that (as I
suppose) Cyniras, Cresus, and Crassus had not the like furniture: naie
if Midas were now liuing &amp; once againe put to his choise, I thinke he
could aske no more, or rather not halfe so much as is there to be seene
and vsed. But I passe ouer to make such needlesse discourses, resoluing
my selfe, that euen in this also, as in all the rest, the excéeding
mercie and louing kindnesse of God dooth wonderfullie appéere towards
vs, in that he hath so largelie indued vs with these his so ample
benefits.</p>

<p>In some great princes courts beyond the seas, &amp; which euen for that
cause are likened vnto hell by diuerse learned writers that haue spent a
great part of their time in them, as Henricus Cornelius Agrippa, one
(for example) who in his epistle "Ad aulicum quendam," saith thus: "An
non in inferno es amice, qui es in aula, vbi dæmonum habitatio est, qui
illic suis artibus humana licèt effigie regnant, atque vbi scelerum
schola est, &amp; animarum iactura ingens, ac quicquid vspiam est perfidiæ
ac doli, quicquid crudelitatis &amp; inclem&#275;tiæ, quicquid effrænatæ
superbiæ, &amp; rapacis auariciæ, quicquid obscenæ libidinis, fædissimæ
impudicitiæ, quicquid nefandæ impietatis, &amp; morum pessimorum, totum
illic aceruatur cumulatissimè, vbi stupra, raptus, incestus, adulteria,
principum &amp; nobilium ludi sunt, vbi fastus &amp; tumor, ira, liuor, fædáque
cupido cum socijs suis imperauit, vbi criminum omnium procellæ
virtutúmque omni&#363; ínenarrabile naufragium, &amp;c." In such great princes
courts (I saie) it is a world to sée what lewd behauiour is vsed among
diuerse of those that resort vnto the same, and what whoredome,
swearing, ribaldrie, atheisme, dicing, carding, carowsing, drunkennesse,
gluttonie, quareling, and such like inconueniences doo dailie take hold,
and sometimes euen among those, in whose estates the like behauiour is
least conuenient (whereby their talke is verified which say that the
thing increaseth and groweth in the courts of princes sauing vertue,
which in such places dooth languish and dailie vade away) all which
enormities are either vtterlie expelled out of the court of England, or
else so qualified by the diligent endeuour of the chiefe officers of hir
graces household, that seldome are anie of these things apparantlie
séene there, without due reprehension, and such seuere correction as
belongeth to those trespasses. Finallie to auoid idlenesse, and preuent
sundrie transgressions, otherwise likelie to be committed and doone,
such order is taken, that euerie office hath either a bible, or the
bookes of the acts and monuments of the church of England, or both,
beside some histories and chronicles lieng therein, for the exercise of
such as come into the same: whereby the stranger that entereth into the
court of England vpon the sudden, shall rather imagine himselfe to come
into some publike schoole of the vniuersities, where manie giue eare to
one that readeth, than into a princes palace, if you conferre the same
with those of other nations. Would to God all honorable personages would
take example of hir graces godlie dealing in this behalfe, and shew
their conformitie vnto these hir so good beginnings! which if they
would, then should manie grieuous offenses (wherewith God is highlie
displeased) be cut off and restreined, which now doo reigne
excéedinglie, in most noble and gentlemens houses, wherof they sée no
paterne within hir graces gates.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Traines of attendants.</span>
I might speake here of the great traines and troopes of seruing men
also, which attend vpon the nobilitie of England in their seuerall
liueries, and with differences of cognisances on their sléeues, whereby
it is knowen to whome they apperteine. I could also set downe what a
goodlie sight it is to sée them muster in the court, which being filled
with them dooth yéeld the contemplation of a noble varietie vnto the
beholder, much like to the shew of the pecocks taile in the full
beautie, or of some medow garnished with infinit kinds and diuersitie of
pleasant floures. But I passe ouer the rehearsall hereof to other men,
who more delite in vaine amplification than I, and séeke to be more
curious in these points than I professe to be.</p>

<p>The discipline of firme peace also that is mainteined within a certeine
<span class="page"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[Page 332]</span>
compasse of the princes palace, is such, as is nothing inferiour to that
we sée dailie practised in the best gouerned holds &amp; fortresses. And
such is the seuere punishment of those that strike within the limits
prohibited, that without all hope of mercie, benefit of clergie, or
sanctuarie, they are sure to loose their right hands at a stroke, and
that in verie solemne maner, the forme whereof I will set downe, and
then make an end of this chapter, to deale with other matters.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Striking within the court and palace of the prince.</span>
At such time therefore as the partie transgressing is conuicted by a
sufficient inquest impanelled for the same purpose, and the time come of
the execution of the sentence, the sergeant of the kings wood-yard
prouideth a square blocke, which he bringeth to some appointed place,
and therewithall a great beetle, staple, and cords, wherewith to fasten
the hand of the offendor vnto the said blocke, vntill the whole
circumstance of his execution be performed. The yeoman of the scullarie
likewise for the time being, dooth prouide a great fire of coales hard
by the blocke, wherein the searing irons are to be made readie against
the chiefe surgeon to the prince or his deputie shall occupie the same.
Upon him also dooth the sergeant or chiefe farrour attend with those
irons, whose office is to deliuer them to the said surgeon when he shall
be redie by searing to vse the same. The groome of the salarie for the
time being or his deputie is furthermore appointed to be readie with
vineger and cold water, and not to depart from the place vntill the arme
of the offendor be bound vp and fullie dressed. And as these things are
thus prouided, so the sergeant surgeon is bound from time to time to be
readie to execute his charge, and seare the stumpe, when the hand is
taken from it. The sergeant of the cellar is at hand also with a cup of
red wine, and likewise the chiefe officer of the pantrie with manchet
bread to giue vnto the said partie after the execution doone, and the
stumpe seared, as the sergeant of the ewerie is with clothes, wherein to
wind and wrap vp the arme, the yeoman of the poultrie with a cocke to
laie vnto it, the yeoman of the chandrie with seared cloths, and
finallie the maister cooke or his deputie with a sharpe dressing knife,
which he deliuereth at the place of execution to the sergeant of the
larder, who dooth hold it vpright in his hand, vntill the execution be
performed by the publike officer appointed therevnto. And this is the
maner of punishment ordeined for those that strike within the princes
palace, or limits of the same. Which should first haue beene executed on
sir Edmund Kneuet, in the yeare 1541. But when he had made great sute to
saue his right hand for the further seruice of the king in his warres,
and willinglie yeelded to forgo his left, in the end the king pardoned
him of both, to no small benefit of the offendor, and publication of the
bountifull nature that remained in the prince. The like priuilege almost
is giuen to churches and churchyards, although in maner of punishment
great difference doo appeere. For he that bralleth or quarelleth in
either of them, is by and by suspended "Ab ingressu ecclesiæ," vntill he
be absolued: as he is also that striketh with the fist, or laieth
violent hands vpon anie whome so euer. But if he happen to smite with
staffe, dagger, or anie maner of weapon, &amp; the same be sufficientlie
found by the verdict of twelue men at his arrainement, beside
excommunication, he is sure to loose one of his eares without all hope
of release. But if he be such a one as hath beene twise condemned and
executed, whereby he hath now none eares, then is he marked with an hot
iron vpon the chéeke, and by the letter F, which is seared déepe into
his flesh, he is from thencefoorth noted as a common barratour and fraie
maker, and therevnto remaineth excommunicate, till by repentance he
deserue to be <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'alsolued'">absolued</ins>. To strike a clearke also (that is to saie) a
minister, is plaine excommunication, and the offendor not to be absolued
but by the prince or his especiall c&#333;mission. Such also is the
generall estate of the exc&#333;municate in euerie respect, that he can
yéeld no testimonie in anie matter so long as he so standeth. No
bargaine or sale that he maketh is auaileable in law, neither anie of
his acts whatsoeuer pleadable, wherby he liueth as an outlaw &amp; a man
altogither out of the princes protection, although it be not lawfull to
kill him, nor anie man otherwise outlawed, without the danger of
fellonie.</p>

<small>OF ARMOUR AND MUNITION.</small><br />

CHAP. XVI.</h3>

<p>How well or how stronglie our countrie hath béene furnished in times
past with armor and artillerie, it lieth not in me as of my selfe to
make rehersall. Yet that it lacked both in the late time of quéen Marie,
not onlie the experience of mine elders, but also the talke of certeine
Spaniards not yet forgotten, did leaue some manifest notice. Vpon the
first I néed not stand, for few will denie it. For the second I haue
heard, that when one of the greatest péeres of Spaine espied our
nakednesse in this behalfe, and did solemnelie vtter in no obscure
place, that it should be an easie matter in short time to conquer
England, bicause it wanted armor, his words were then not so rashlie
vttered, as they were politikelie noted. For albeit that for the present
time their efficacie was dissembled, and semblance made as though he
spake but merilie, yet at the verie enterance of this our gratious
quéene vnto the possession of the crowne, they were so prouidentlie
called to remembrance, and such spéedie reformation sought of all hands
for the redresse of this inconuenience, that our countrie was sooner
furnished with armour and munition, from diuerse parts of the maine
(beside great plentie that was forged here at home) than our enimies
could get vnderstanding of anie such prouision to be made. By this
policie also was the no small hope conceiued by Spaniards vtterlie cut
off, who of open fréends being now become our secret enimies, and
thereto watching a time wherein to atchieue some heauie exploit against
vs and our countrie, did therevpon change their purposes, whereby
England obteined rest, that otherwise might haue béene sure of sharpe
and cruell wars. Thus a Spanish word vttered by one man at one time,
ouerthrew or at the least wise hindered sundrie priuie practises of
manie at another. In times past the chéefe force of England consisted in
their long bowes. But now we haue in maner generallie giuen ouer that
kind of artillerie, and for long bowes in déed doo practise to shoot
compasse for our pastime: which kind of shooting can neuer yéeld anie
smart stroke, nor beat downe our enimies, as our countrie men were woont
to doo at euerie time of néed. Certes the Frenchmen and Rutters deriding
our new archerie in respect of their corslets, will not let in open
skirmish, if anie leisure serue, to turne vp their tailes and crie;
Shoote English, and all bicause our strong shooting is decaied and laid
in bed. But if some of our Englishmen now liued that serued king Edward
the third in his warres with France, the bréech of such a varlet should
haue beene nailed to his bum with one arrow, and an other fethered in
his bowels, before he should haue turned about to sée who shot the
first. But as our shooting is thus in manner vtterlie decaied among vs
one waie, so our countrie men wex skilfull in sundrie other points, as
in shooting in small péeces, the caliuer, and handling of the pike, in
the seuerall vses whereof they are become verie expert.</p>

<p>Our armour differeth not from that of other nations, and therefore
consisteth of corslets, almaine riuets, shirts of maile, iackes quilted
and couered ouer with leather, fustian, or canuas, ouer thicke plates of
iron that are sowed in the same, &amp; of which there is no towne or village
that hath not hir conuenient furniture. The said armour and munition
likewise is kept in one seuerall place of euerie towne, appointed by the
consent of the whole parish, where it is alwaies readie to be had and
worne within an houres warning. Sometime also it is occupied, when it
pleaseth the magistrate either to view the able men, &amp; take note of the
well kéeping of the same, or finallie to sée those that are inrolled to
exercise each one his seuerall weapon, at the charge of the townesmen of
each parish according to his appointment. Certes there is almost no
village so poore in England (be it neuer so small) that hath not
sufficient furniture in a readinesse to set foorth thrée or foure
soldiers, as one archer, one gunner, one pike, &amp; a bilman at the least.
No there is not so much wanting as their verie liueries and caps, which
are least to be accounted of, if anie hast required: so that if this
good order may continue, it shall be vnpossible for the sudden enimie to
<span class="page"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[Page 334]</span>
find vs vnprouided. As for able men for seruice, thanked be God, we are
not without good store, for by the musters taken 1574 and 1575, our
number amounted to 1172674, and yet were they not so narrowlie taken,
but that a third part of this like multitude was left vnbilled and
vncalled. What store of munition and armour the quéenes maiestie hath in
hir storehouses, it lieth not in me to yéeld account, sith I suppose the
same to be infinit. And whereas it was commonlie said after the losse of
Calis, that England should neuer recouer the store of ordinance there
left and lost: that same is at this time prooued false, sith euen some
of the same persons doo now confesse, that this land was neuer better
furnished with these things in anie kings daies that reigned since the
conquest.</p>

<h4><em>The names of our greatest ordinance are commonlie these.</em></h4>

<p class="ind1b">Robinet, whose weight is two hundred pounds, and it hath one inch and a
quarter within the mouth.<br />

Falconet weigheth fiue hundred pounds, and his widenesse is two inches
  within the mouth.<br />

Falcon hath eight hundred pounds, and two inches and a halfe within
  the mouth.<br />

Minion poiseth eleauen hundred pounds, and hath thrée inches and a
  quarter within the mouth.<br />

Sacre hath fiftéene hundred poundes, and is three inches and a halfe
  wide in the mouth.<br />

Demie Culuerijn weigheth three thousand pounds, and hath foure inches

Culuerijn hath foure thousand pounds, and fiue inches and an halfe

Demie Canon six thousand pounds, and six inches and an halfe within
  the mouth.<br />

Canon seauen thousand pounds, and eight inches within the mouth.<br />

E. Canon eight thousand pounds, and seauen inches within the mouth.</p>

<p class="ind1c">Basiliske 9000 pounds, eight inches, and thrée quarters within the
  mouth. By which proportions also it is easie to come by the weight of
  euerie shot, how manie scores it doth flée at point blanke, how much

  ech bullet ought to carrie.</p>

<p>I might here take iust occasion to speake of the princes armories. But
what shall it néed? sith the whole realme is hir armorie, and therefore
hir furniture infinit. The Turke had one gun made by one Orban a Dane,
the caster of his ordinance, which could not be drawen to the siege of
Constantinople, but by seauentie yokes of oxen, and two thousand men; he
had two other there also whose shot poised aboue two talents in weight,
made by the same Orban. But to procéed. As for the armories of some of
the nobilitie (whereof I also haue seene a part) they are so well
furnished, that within some one barons custodie I haue séene thrée score
<span class="page"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[Page 335]</span>
or a hundred corslets at once, beside caliuers, hand-guns, bowes,
sheffes of arrowes, pikes, bils, polaxes, flaskes, touchboxes, targets,
&amp;c: the verie sight wherof appalled my courage. What would the wearing
of some of them doo then (trow you) if I should be inforced to vse one
of them in the field? But thanked be God, our peaceable daies are such,
as no man hath anie great cause to occupie them at all, but onelie
taketh good leisure to haue them in a readinesse, and therefore both
high and lowe in England</p>

<p class="ind1">Cymbala pro galeis pro scutis tympana pulsant.</p>

<p>I would write here also of our maner of going to the warres, but what
hath the long blacke gowne to doo with glistering armour? what sound
<span class="leftnote">Malè musis cum Marte.</span>
acquaintance can there be betwixt Mars and the Muses? or how should a
man write anie thing to the purpose of that wherewith he is nothing
acquainted? This neuerthelesse will I adde of things at home, that
seldome shall you sée anie of my countriemen aboue eightéene or twentie
yéeres old to go without a dagger at the least at his backe or by his
side, although they be aged burgesses or magistrates of anie citie, who
in appeerance are most exempt from brabling and contention. Our
nobilitie weare commonlie swords or rapiers with their daggers, as dooth
euerie common seruing man also that followeth his lord and master. Some
desperate cutters we haue in like sort, which carrie two daggers or two
rapiers in a sheath alwaies about them, wherewith in euerie dronken
fraie they are knowen to worke much mischiefe; their swords &amp; daggers
also are of a great length, and longer than the like vsed in anie other
countrie, whereby ech one pretendeth to haue the more aduantage of his
enimie. But as manie orders haue béene taken for the intollerable length
of these weapons; so I sée as yet small redresse: but where the cause
thereof doth rest, in sooth for my part I wote not. I might here speake
of the excessiue staues which diuerse that trauell by the waie doo
carrie vpon their shoulders, whereof some are twelue or thirtéene foote
long, beside the pike of twelue inches: but as they are commonlie
suspected of honest men to be theeues and robbers, or at the leastwise
scarse true men which beare them; so by reason of this and the like
suspicious weapons, the honest traueller is now inforced to ride with a
case of dags at his sadle bow, or with some pretie short snapper,
whereby he may deale with them further off in his owne defense before he
come within the danger of these weapons. Finallie, no man trauelleth by
the waie without his sword, or some such weapon, with vs; except the
minister, who c&#333;monlie weareth none at all, vnlesse it be a dagger or
hanger at his side. Seldome also are they or anie other waifaring men
robbed without the consent of the chamberleine, tapster, or ostler where
they bait &amp; lie, who féeling at their alighting whether their capcases
or budgets be of anie weight or not, by taking them downe from their
sadles, or otherwise see their store in drawing of their purses, do by
and by giue intimation to some one or other attendant dailie in the yard
or house, or dwelling hard by vpon such matches, whether the preie be
worth the following or no. If it be for their turne, then the gentleman
peraduenture is asked which waie he trauelleth, and whether it please
him to haue another ghest to beare him companie at supper, who rideth
the same waie in the morning that he doth, or not. And thus if he admit
him or be glad of his acquaintance, the cheate is halfe wrought. And
often it is séene that the new ghest shall be robbed with the old,
onelie to colour out the matter and kéepe him from suspicion. Sometimes
when they knowe which waie the passenger trauelleth, they will either go
before and lie in wait for him, or else come galloping apace after,
wherby they will be sure, if he ride not the stronger, to be fingering
with his purse. And these are some of the policies of such shrews or
close booted gentlemen as lie in wait for fat booties by the high waies,
and which are most commonlie practised in the winter season about the
feast of Christmas, when seruing men and vnthriftie gentlemen want monie
to plaie at the dice and cards, lewdlie spending in such wise whatsoeuer
they haue wickedlie gotten, till some of them sharplie set vpon their
cheuisances, be trussed vp in a Tiburne tippet, which happeneth vnto
them commonlie before they come to middle age. Wherby it appéereth that
some sort of youth will oft haue his swinge, although it be in a halter.</p>

<small>OF THE NAUIE OF ENGLAND.</small><br />

CHAP. XVII.</h3>

<p>There is nothing that hath brought me into more admiration of the power
and force of antiquitie, than their diligence and care had of their
nauies: wherein, whether I consider their spéedie building, or great
number of ships which some one kingdome or region possessed at one
instant; it giueth me still occasion, either to suspect the historie, or
to thinke that in our times we come verie farre behind them. For what a
thing is it to haue a ship growing on the stub, and sailing on the sea
within the space of fiue and fiftie daies? And yet such a nauie was to
be séene in the first war of Carthage, led thither by Duellius the
Romane. In the warres also against Hieron two hundred and twentie tall
ships bare leafe &amp; saile within fiue and fortie daies. In the second
warre of Carthage the nauie that went with Scipio was felled in the
wood, and séene to saile on the sea fullie furnished in sixe weekes:
which vnto them that are ignorant of things doth séeme to be false, and
vnpossible. In like maner for multitude, we find in Polybius, that at
one skirmish on the sea the Romans lost seauen hundred vessels, which
bare ech of them fiue rowes of ores on a side, and the Carthaginenses
fiue hundred. And albeit the formes and apparell of these vessels were
not altogither correspondent to our ships and gallies made in these
daies: yet the capacitie of most of them did not onelie match, but farre
excéed them; so that if one of their biremes onlie conteined so much in
burden as a ship of ours of six hundred tun: what shall we thinke of
those which had seauen rowes of ores walking on a side? But least I
should séeme to speake more of these forren things than the course of
the historie doth permit without licence to digresse: giue me leaue (I
beséech thee gentle reader) to wade yet a little further in the report
of these ancient formes &amp; kinds of vessels. For albeit that the
discourse hereof maketh little to the description of our present nauie
in England: yet shall the report thereof not be vnprofitable and
vnpleasant to such as shall reade among the writings of their capacities
and moulds. It shall not be amisse therefore to begin at the nauie of
Xerxes, of which ech meane vessell (as appéereth by Herodot) was able to
receiue two hundred and thirtie souldiers, and some of them thrée
hundred. These were called triremes, and were indéede gallies that had
thrée rowes of ores on euerie side; for the word <em>Nauis</em> is
indifferentlie applied so well to the gallie as ship, as to the
conuersant in histories is easie to be found. In old time also they had
gallies of foure rowes, fiue rowes, six, seauen, eight, nine, twelue,
yea fifteene rowes of ores on a side; iudge you then of what quantitie
those vessels were. Plinie lib. 7. noteth one Damasthenes to be the
first maker of the gallies with two rowes called biremes: Thucidides
referreth the triremes to Ammocles of Corinthum; the quadriremes were
deuised by Aristotle of Carthage; the quinquiremes by Nesichthon of
Salamina; the gallie of six rowes by Xenagoras of Syracusa: from this to
the tenth Nesigiton brought vp; Alexander the great caused one to be
made of twelue; Ptolomeus Soter of fiftéene; Demetrius the sonne of
Antigonus of thirtie; Ptolom. Philad. of fortie; Ptol. Triphon of fiftie:
all which aboue foure were none other (in mine opinion) than vnweldie
carts, and more seruing for pleasure and to gaze vpon, than anie  vse in
<span class="page"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[Page 337]</span>
the wars for which they should be deuised. But of all other I note one
of fortie rowes, which Ptolo Philopater builded, conteining 200 and
eightie cubits in length, and eight and fortie cubits in breadth: it
held also foure thousand ores, foure hundred mariners, and three
thousand souldiers, so that in the said vessell were seauen thousand and
foure hundred persons: a report incredible, if truth and good testimonie
did not confirme the same. I must needs confesse therefore, that the
ancient vessels far exceeded ours for capacitie: neuerthelesse if you
regard the forme, and the assurance from perill of the sea, and
therewithall the strength and nimblenesse of such as are made in our
time, you shall easilie find that ours are of more value than theirs:
for as the greatest vessell is not alwaies the safest, so that of most
huge capacitie is not alwaies the aptest to shift and brooke the seas:
as might be seene by the great Henrie, the hugest vessell that euer
England framed in our times. Neither were the ships of old like vnto
ours in mould and maner of building aboue the water (for of low gallies
in our seas we make small account) nor so full of ease within, sith time
hath ingendred more skill in the wrights, and brought all things to more
perfection than they had in the beginning. And now to come vnto our
purpose at the first intended.</p>

<p>The nauie of England may be diuided into three sortes, of which the one
serueth for the warres, the other for burden, and the third for
fishermen, which get their liuing by fishing on the sea. How manie of
the first order are mainteined within the realme, it passeth my cunning
to expresse: yet sith it may be parted into the nauie roiall and common
fleete, I thinke good to speake of those that belong vnto the prince,
and so much the rather, for that their number is certeine &amp; well knowne
to verie manie. Certes there is no prince in Europe that hath a more
beautifull or gallant sort of ships than the quéenes maiestie of England
at this present, and those generallie are of such exceeding force, that
two of them being well appointed and furnished as they ought, will not
let to encounter with thrée or foure of those of other countries, and
either bowge them or put them to flight, if they may not bring them
home.</p>

<p>Neither are the moulds of anie forren barkes so conuenientlie made, to
brooke so well one sea as another lieng vpon the shore in anie part of
the continent as those of England. And therefore the common report that
strangers make of our ships amongst themselues is dailie confirmed to be
true, which is, that for strength, assurance, nimblenesse and swiftnesse
of sailing, there are no vessels in the world to be compared with ours.
And all these are committed to the regiment and safe custodie of the
admerall, who is so called (as some imagine) of the Gréeke word
<em>Almiras</em> a capiteine on the sea, for so saith Zonaras "in Basilio
Macedone &amp; Basilio Porphyriogenito," though other fetch it from <em>Ad
mare</em> the Latine words, another sort from <em>Amyras</em> the Saracen
magistrate, or from some French deriuation: but these things are not for
this place, and therefore I passe them ouer. The quéenes highnesse hath
at this present (which is the foure and twentith of hir reigne) alreadie
made and furnished, to the number of foure or fiue and twentie great
ships, which lie for the most part in Gillingham rode, beside thrée
gallies, of whose particular names and furnitures (so far foorth as I
can come by them) it shall not be amisse to make report at this time.</p>

<p>It is said, that as kings and princes haue in the yoong daies of the
world, and long since framed themselues to erect euerie yeare a citie in
some one place or other of their kingdoms (and no small woonder that
Sardanapalus should begin &amp; finish two, to wit, Anchialus and Tharsus in
<span class="page"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[Page 338]</span>
one daie) so hir grace dooth yearelie build one ship or other to the
better defense of hir frontiers from the enimie. But as of this report I
haue no assured certeintie, so it shall suffice to haue said so much of
these things: yet this I thinke worthie further to be added, that if
they should all be driuen to seruice at one instant (which God forbid)
she should haue a power by sea of about nine or ten thousand men, which
were a notable companie, beside the supplie of other vessels
apperteining to hir subiects to furnish vp hir voiage.</p>

<p>Beside these hir grace hath other in hand also, of whome hereafter as
their turnes doo come about, I will not let to leaue some further
remembrance. She hath likewise thrée notable gallies: the Spéed well,
the Trie right, and the Blacke gallie, with the sight whereof and rest
of the nauie roiall, it is incredible to saie how greatlie hir grace is
delighted: and not without great cause (I saie) sith by their meanes hir
coasts are kept in quiet, and sundrie forren enimies put backe, which
otherwise would inuade vs. The number of those that serue for burden
with the other, whereof I haue made mention alreadie, and whose vse is
dailie séene, as occasion serueth, in time of the warres, is to mée
vtterlie vnknowne. Yet if the report of one record be anie thing at all
to be credited, there are 135 ships that exceed 500 tun, topmen vnder
100 and aboue fortie 656: hoies 100: but of hulkes, catches,
fisherboats, and craiers, it lieth not in me to deliuer the iust
account, sith they are hardlie to come by. Of these also there are some
of the quéenes maiesties subiects that haue two or three, some foure or
six, and (as I heard of late) one man whose name I suppresse for
modesties sake, hath bene knowne long since to haue had sixtéene or
seuentéene, and emploied them wholie to the wafting in and out of our
merchants, whereby he hath reaped no small commoditie and gaine. I might
take occasion to tell of the notable and difficult voiages made into
strange countries by Englishmen, and of their dailie successe there: but
as these things are nothing incident to my purpose, so I surcease to
speake of them. Onelie this will I ad, to the end all men shall
vnderstand somewhat of the great masses of treasure dailie emploied vpon
our nauie, how there are few of those ships, of the first and second
sort, that being apparelled and made readie to sale, are not woorth one
thousand pounds, or thrée thousand ducats at the least, if they should
presentlie be sold. What shall we thinke then of the greater, but
especiallie of the nauie roiall, of which some one vessell is woorth two
of the other, as the shipwrights haue often told me? It is possible that
some couetous person hearing this report, will either not credit it at
all, or suppose monie so emploied to be nothing profitable to the
queenes coffers: as a good husband said once when he hard there should
be prouision made for armor, wishing the quéenes monie to be rather laid
out to some spéedier returne of gaine vnto hir grace, bicause the realme
(saith he) is in case good enough, and so peraduenture he thought. But
if as by store of armour for the defense of the countrie, he had
likewise vnderstanded that the good kéeping of the sea, is the safegard
of our land, he would haue altered his censure, and soone giuen ouer his
iudgement. For in times past, when our nation made small account of
nauigation, how soone did the Romans, then the Saxons, &amp; last of all the
Danes inuade this Iland? whose crueltie in the end inforced our
countrimen, as it were euen against their wils, to prouide for ships
from other places, and build at home of their owne, whereby their
enimies were oftentimes distressed. But most of all were the Normans
therein to be commended. For in a short processe of time after the
conquest of this Iland, and good consideration had for the well kéeping
of the same, they supposed nothing more commodious for the defense of
the countrie, than the maintenance of a strong nauie, which they
spéedilie prouided, mainteined, and thereby reaped in the end their
wished securitie, wherewith before their times this Iland was neuer
acquainted. Before the comming of the Romans, I doo not read that we had
anie ships at all, except a few made of wicker and couered with buffle
hides, like vnto the which there are some to be seene at this present in
Scotland (as I heare) although there be a little (I wote not well what)
difference betwéene them. Of the same also Solinus speaketh, so far as I
remember: neuerthelesse it may be gathered by his words, how the vpper
parts of them aboue the water onelie were framed of the said wickers, and
<span class="page"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[Page 339]</span>
<span class="leftnote">The Britons fasted all the while they were
at the sea in these ships.</span>
that the Britons did vse to fast all the whiles they went to the sea in
them: but whether it were doone for policie or superstition, as yet I
doo not read.</p>
<p>
In the beginning of the Saxons regiment we had some ships also, but as
their number and mould was litle and nothing to the purpose, so Egbert
was the first prince that euer throughlie began to know this necessitie
of a nauie, and vse the seruice thereof in the defense of his countrie.
After him also other princes, as Alfred, Edgar, Ethelred, &amp;c: indeuoured
more and more to store themselues at the full with ships of all
quantities, but chieflie Edgar, for he prouided a nauie of 1600 aliàs
3600 saile, which he diuided into foure parts, and sent them to abide
vpon foure sundrie coasts of the land to keepe the same from pirats.
Next vnto him (and worthie to be remembred) is Etheldred, who made a
law, that euerie man holding 310 hidelands, should find a ship furnished
to serue him in the warres. Howbeit, and as I said before, when all
their nauie was at the greatest, it was not comparable for force and
sure building, to that which afterward the Normans prouided; neither
that of the Normans anie thing like to the same that is to be séene now
in these our daies. For the iourneies also of our ships, you shall
vnderstand, that a well builded vessell will run or saile commonlie
thrée hundred leagues or nine hundred miles in a wéeke, or peraduenture
some will go 2200 leagues in six wéekes and an halfe. And suerlie, if
their lading be readie against they come thither, there will be of them
that will be here, at the west Indies, &amp; home againe in twelue or
thirteene wéekes from Colchester; although the said Indies be eight
hundred leagues from the cape or point of Cornewall, as I haue beene
informed. This also I vnderstand by report of some trauellers, that if
anie of our vessels happen to make a voiage to Hispaniola or new Spaine,
called in time past Quinquezia and Haiti, and lieth betwéene the north
tropike and the equator, after they haue once touched at the Canaries,
(which are eight daies sailing or two hundred and fiftie leages from S.
Lucas de Barameda in Spaine) they will be there in thirtie or fourtie
daies, &amp; home againe in Cornewall in other eight wéekes, which is a
goodlie matter, beside the safetie and quietnesse in the passage. But
more of this elsewhere.</p>

<small>OF FAIRES AND MARKETS.</small><br />

CHAP. XVIII.</h3>

<p>There are (as I take it) few great townes in England, that haue not
their wéekelie markets, one or more granted from the prince, in which
all maner of prouision for houshold is to be bought and sold, for ease
and benefit of the countrie round about. Wherby as it c&#333;meth to passe
that no buier shall make anie great iourneie in the purueiance of his
necessities: so no occupier shall haue occasion to trauell far off with
his commodities, except it be to séeke for the highest prices, which
commonlie are néere vnto great cities, where round and spéediest
vtterance is alwaies to be had. And as these haue béene in times past
erected for the benefit of the realme, so are they in many places too
too much abused: for the reliefe and ease of the buier is not so much
intended in them, as the benefit of the seller. Neither are the
magistrats for the most part (as men loth to displease their neighbours
for their one yeares dignitie) so carefull in their offices, as of right
and dutie they should bée. For in most of these markets neither assises
of bread nor orders for goodnesse and swéetnesse of graine, and other
commodities that are brought thither to be sold, are anie whit looked
vnto; but ech one suffered to sell or set vp what and how himselfe
listeth: &amp; this is one euident cause of dearth and scarsitie in time of
great abundance.</p>

<p>I could (if I would) exemplifie in manie, but I will touch no one
particularlie, sith it is rare to sée in anie countrie towne (as I said)
the assise of bread well kept according to the statute. And yet if anie
countrie baker happen to come in among them on the market daie with
<span class="page"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[Page 340]</span>
bread of better quantitie, they find fault by and by with one thing or
another in his stuffe; whereby the honest poore man, whome the law of
nations doo commend, for that he indeuoureth to liue by anie lawfull
meanes, is driuen awaie, and no more to come there vpon some round
penaltie, by vertue of their priuileges. Howbeit though they are so nice
in the proportion of their bread, yet in lieu of the same, there is such
headie ale &amp; béere in most of them, as for the mightinesse thereof among
such as séeke it out, is commonlie called huffecap, the mad dog, father
whoresonne, angels food, dragons milke, go by the wall, stride wide, and
lift leg, &amp;c. And this is more to be noted, that when one of late fell
by Gods prouidence into a troubled c&#333;science, after he had considered
well of his reachlesse life, and dangerous estate: another thinking
belike to change his colour and not his mind, caried him straightwaie to
the strongest ale, as to the next physician. It is incredible to saie
how our maltbugs lug at this liquor, euen as pigs should lie in a row,
lugging at their dames teats, till they lie still againe, and be not
able to wag. Neither did Romulus and Remus sucke their shee woolfe or
shéepheards wife Lupa, with such eger and sharpe deuotion, as these men
hale at hufcap, till they be red as cockes, &amp; litle wiser than their
combs. But how am I fallen from the market into the alehouse? In
returning therefore vnto my purpose, I find that in corne great abuse is
dailie suffered, to the great preiudice of the towne and countrie,
especiallie the poore artificer and householder, which tilleth no land,
but laboring all the wéeke to buie a bushell or two of graine on the
market daie, can there haue none for his monie: bicause bodgers, loders,
and common carriers of corne doo not onlie buie vp all, but giue aboue
the price, to be serued of great quantities. Shall I go anie further?
Well I will saie yet a little more, and somewhat by mine owne
experience.</p>

<p>At Michaelmasse time poore men must make monie of their graine, that
they may paie their rents. So long then as the poore man hath to sell,
rich men will bring out none, but rather buie vp that which the poore
bring, vnder pretense of seed corne, or alteration of graine, although
they bring none of their owne, bicause one wheat often sowen without
change of séed, will soone decaie and be conuerted into darnell. For
this cause therefore they must needs buie in the markets, though they be
twentie miles off and where they be not knowne, promising there if they
happen to be espied (which God wot is verie seldome) to send so much to
their next market, to be performed I wot not when.</p>

<p>If this shift serue not (neither dooth the fox vse alwaies one tracke
for feare of a snare) they will compound with some one of the towne
where the market is holden, who for a pot of hufcap or merie go downe,
will not let to buie it for them, and that in his owne name. Or else
<span class="leftnote">Suborned bodgers.</span>
they wage one poore man or other, to become a bodger, and thereto get
him a licence vpon some forged surmise, which being doone, they will
féed him with monie, to buie for them till he hath filled their lofts,
and then if he can doo any good for himselfe so it is, if not, they will
giue him somewhat for his paines at this time, &amp; reserue him for an
other yeare. How manie of the like prouiders stumble vpon blind créekes
at the sea coast, I wote not well; but that some haue so doone and yet
doo vnder other mens wings, the case is too too plaine. But who dare
<span class="leftnote">Bodgers licenced.</span>
find fault with them, when they haue once a licence? yea though it be
but to serue a meane gentlemans house with corne, who hath cast vp all
his tillage, bicause he boasteth how he can buie his graine in the
market better cheape, than he can sow his land, as the rich grasier
often dooth also vpon the like deuise, bicause grasing requireth a
smaller household and lesse attendance and charge. If anie man come to
buie a bushell or two for his expenses vnto the market crosse, answer is
made; Forsooth here was one euen now that bad me monie for it, and I
hope he will haue it. And to saie the truth, these bodgers are faire
chapmen, for there are no more words with them, but Let me see it, what
shall I giue you, knit it vp, I will haue it, go carie it to such a
chamber, and if you bring in twentie seme more in the weeke daie to such
an Inne or sollar where I laie my corne, I will haue it and giue you
pence or more in euerie bushell for six wéekes day of paiment than an
other will. Thus the bodgers beare awaie all, so that the poore
artificer and labourer cannot make his prouision in the markets, sith
they will hardlie now a daies sell by the bushell, nor breake their
<span class="page"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[Page 341]</span>
measure; and so much the rather, for that the buier will looke (as they
saie) for so much ouer measure in a bushell as the bodger will doo in a
quarter. Naie the poore man cannot oft get anie of the farmer at home,
bicause he prouideth altogither to serue the bodger, or hath an hope
grounded vpon a greedie and insatiable desire of gaine, that the sale
will be better in the market: so that he must giue two pence or a groate
more in a bushell at his house than the last market craued, or else go
without it, and sléepe with an hungrie bellie. Of the common carriage of
corne ouer vnto the parts beyond the seas I speake not; or at the
leastwise if I should, I could not touch it alone but néeds must ioine
other prouision withall, whereby not onelie our fréends abroad, but also
manie of our aduersaries and countriemen the papists are abundantlie
relieued (as the report goeth) but sith I sée it not, I will not so
trust mine eares as to write it for a truth. But to returne to our
markets againe.</p>
<p>
By this time the poore occupier hath all sold his crop for néed of
monie, being readie peraduenture to buie againe yer long. And now is the
whole sale of corne in the great occupiers hands, who hitherto haue
threshed little or none of their owne, but bought vp of other men, so
much as they could come by. Hencefoorth also they begin to sell, not by
the quarter or load at the first, for marring the market, but by the
bushell or two, or an horsseload at the most, therby to be séene to
keepe the crosse, either for a shew, or to make men eger to buie, and so
as they may haue it for monie, not to regard what they paie. And thus
corne waxeth deere, but it will be déerer the next market daie. It is
possible also that they mislike the price in the beginning for the whole
yeare insuing, as men supposing that corne will be litle worth for this,
&amp; of better price in the next yeare. For they haue certeine
superstitious obseruations, whereby they will giue a gesse at the sale
of corne for the yeare following. And our countriemen doo vse commonlie
for barleie where I dwell, to iudge after the price at Baldocke vpon S.
Matthewes daie, and for wheat as it is sold in séed time. They take in
like sort experiment by sight of the first flockes of cranes that flée
southward in winter, the age of the moone in the beginning of Ianuarie,
&amp; such other apish toies, as by laieng twelue cornes vpon the hot hearth
for the twelue moneths, &amp;c: whereby they shew themselues to be scant
good christians, but what care they so they may come by monie? Herevpon
also will they thresh out thrée parts of the old corne, toward the
latter end of the summer, when new commeth apace to hand, and cast the
same in the fourth vnthreshed, where it shall lie vntill the next
spring, or peraduenture till it must and putrifie. Certes it is not
deintie to sée mustie corne in manie of our great markets of England,
which these great occupiers bring foorth when they can kéepe it no
longer. But as they are inforced oftentimes vpon this one occasion
somwhat to abate the price, so a plague is not seldome ingendred thereby
among the poorer sort that of necessitie must buie the same, wherby
manie thousands of all degrees are consumed, of whose deaths (in mine
opinion) these farmers are not vnguiltie. But to proceed. If they laie
not vp their graine or wheat in this maner, they haue yet another
policie, whereby they will séeme to haue but small store left in their
barnes: for else they will gird their sheues by the band, and stacke it
vp of new in lesse roome, to the end it may not onlie séeme lesse in
quantitie, but also giue place to the corne that is yet to come into the
barne, or growing in the field. If there happen to be such plentie in
the market on anie market daie, that they cannot sell at their own
price, then will they set it vp in some fréends house, against an other
or the third daie, &amp; not bring it foorth till they like of the sale. If
they sell anie at home, beside harder measure, it shall be déerer to the
poore man that bieth it by two pence or a groat in a bushell than they
may sell it in the market. But as these things are worthie redresse, so
I wish that God would once open their eies that deale thus, to sée their
owne errours: for as yet some of them little care how manie poore men
suffer extremitie, so that they may fill their purses, and carie awaie
the gaine.</p>

<p>It is a world also to sée how most places of the realme are pestered
with purueiours, who take vp egs, butter, chéese, pigs, capons, hens,
chickens, hogs, bakon, &amp;c: in one market, vnder pretense of their
commissions, &amp; suffer their wiues to sell the same in another, or to
<span class="page"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[Page 342]</span>
pulters of London. If these chapmen be absent but two or thrée market
daies, then we may perfectlie sée these wares to be more reasonablie
sold, and therevnto the crosses sufficientlie furnished of all things.
In like sort, since the number of buttermen haue so much increased, and
since they trauell in such wise, that they come to mens houses for their
butter faster than they can make it; it is almost incredible to see how
the price of butter is augmented: whereas when the owners were inforced
to bring it to the market townes, &amp; fewer of these butter buiers were
stirring, our butter was scarslie woorth eighteene pence the gallon,
that now is worth thrée shillings foure pence, &amp; perhaps fiue shillings.
Wherby also I gather that the maintenance of a superfluous number of
dealers in most trades, tillage alwaies excepted, is one of the greatest
causes why the prices of things become excessiue: for one of them doo
c&#333;monlie vse to out bid another. And whilest our countrie commodities
are commonlie bought and sold at our priuate houses, I neuer looke to
sée this enormitie redressed, or the markets well furnished.</p>

<p>I could saie more, but this is euen inough, &amp; more peraduenture than I
shall be well thanked for: yet true it is though some thinke it no
trespasse. This moreouer is to be lamented, that one generall measure is
not in vse throughout all England, but euerie market towne hath in maner
a seuerall bushell, and the lesser it be, the more sellers it draweth to
resort vnto the same. Such also is the couetousnesse of manie clearkes
of the market, that in taking view of measures, they will alwaie so
prouide, that one and the same bushell shall be either too big or too
little at their next comming, and yet not depart without a fee at the
first: so that what by their mending at one time and empairing the same
at another, the countrie is greatlie charged, and few iust measures to
be had in anie stéed. It is oft found likewise, that diuerse
vnconscionable dealers haue one measure to sell by, &amp; another to buie
withall, the like is also in weights and yet all sealed and bronded.
Wherefore it were verie good that these two were reduced vnto one
standard, that is, one bushell, one pound, one quarter, one hundred, one
tale, one number: so should things in time fall into better order, and
fewer causes of contention be mooued in this land. Of the complaint of
such poore tenants as paie rent corne vnto their landlords, I speake
not, who are often dealt withall very hardlie. For beside that in the
measuring of ten quarters, for the most part they lose one through the
iniquitie of the bushell (such is the gréedinesse of the appointed
receiuers thereof) fault is found also with the goodnesse and cleannesse
of the graine. Wherby some péece of monie must néeds passe vnto their
purses to stop their mouths withall, or else my lord will not like of
the corne; Thou art worthie to loose thy lease, &amp;c. Or if it be cheaper
in the market, than the rate allowed for it is in their rents, then must
they paie monie and no corne, which is no small extremitie. And thereby
we may see how each one of vs indeuoureth to fléece and eat vp another.</p>

<p>Another thing there is in our markets worthie to be looked vnto, and
that is the recariage of graine from the same into lofts and sollars, of
which before I gaue some intimation: wherefore if it were ordered, that
euerie seller should make his market by an houre, or else the bailie, or
clearke of the said market to make sale therof according to his
discretion, without libertie to the farmer to set vp their corne in
houses and chambers, I am persuaded that the prices of our graine would
soone be abated. Againe, if it were enacted that each one should kéepe
his next market with his graine, and not to run six, eight, ten,
fouretéene, or twentie miles from home to sell his corne, where he dooth
find the highest price, and therby leaueth his neighbours vnfurnished, I
doo not thinke but that our markets would be farre better serued than at
this present they are. Finallie if mens barns might be indifferentlie
viewed immediatlie after haruest, and a note gathered by an estimat, and
kept by some appointed &amp; trustie person for that purpose, we should haue
much more plentie of corne in our towne crosses than as yet is commonlie
seene: bicause each one hideth and hoordeth what he may vpon purpose
either that it will be déerer, or that he shall haue some priuie veine
by bodgers, who doo accustomablie so deale, that the sea dooth load
awaie no small part thereof into other countries &amp; our enimies, to the
great hinderance of our common-wealth at home, and more likelie yet to
<span class="page"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[Page 343]</span>
be, except some remedie be found. But what doo I talke of these things,
or desire the suppression of bodgers being a minister? Certes I may
speake of them right well, as féeling the harme in that I am a buier,
neuerthelesse I speake generallie in ech of them.</p>

<p>To conclude therefore, in our markets all things are to be sold
necessarie for mans vse, and there is our prouision made commonlie for
all the wéeke insuing. Therefore as there are no great townes without
one weekelie market at the least, so there are verie few of them that
haue not one or two faires or more within the compasse of the yeare
assigned vnto them by the prince. And albeit that some of them are not
much better than Lowse faire or the common kirkemesses beyond the sea,
yet there are diuerse not inferiour to the greatest marts in Europe, as
Sturbridge faire neere to Cambridge, Bristow faire, Bartholomew faire at
London, Lin mart, Cold faire at Newport pond for cattell, and diuerse
other, all which or at leastwise the greatest part of them (to the end I
may with the more ease to the reader and lesse trauell to my selfe
fulfill my taske in their recitall) I haue set downe, according to the
names of the moneths wherein they are holden, at the end of this booke,
where you shall find them at large, as I borowed the same from I. Stow,
and the reports of others.</p>

<small>OF PARKES AND WARRENS.</small><br />

CHAP. XIX.</h3>

<p>In euerie shire of England there is great plentie of parkes, whereof
some here and there, to wit, welnere to the number of two hundred for
hir daily prouision of that flesh apperteine to the prince, the rest to
such of the nobilitie and gentlemen as haue their lands and patrimonies
lieng in or néere vnto the same. I would gladlie haue set downe the iust
number of these inclosures to be found in euerie countie: but sith I
cannot so doo, it shall suffice to saie, that in Kent and Essex onelie
are to the number of an hundred, and twentie in the bishoprike of
Durham, wherein great plentie of fallow deere is cherished and kept. As
for warrens of conies, I iudge them almost innumerable, and dailie like
to increase, by reason that the blacke skins of those beasts are thought
to counteruaile the prices of their naked carcases, and this is the
onelie cause whie the graie are lesse estéemed. Néere vnto London their
quickest merchandize is of the yong rabbets, wherfore the older conies
are brought from further off, where there is no such speedie vtterance
of rabbets and sucklings in their season, nor so great losse by their
skins, sith they are suffered to growe vp to their full greatnesse with
their owners. Our parkes are generallie inclosed with strong pale made
of oke, of which kind of wood there is great store cherished in the
woodland countries from time to time in ech of them, onelie for the
maintenance of the said defense, and safe-keeping of the fallow déere
from ranging about the countrie. Howbeit in times past diuerse haue been
fensed in with stone walles (especiallie in the times of the Romans, who
first brought fallow déere into this land, as some coniecture) albeit
those inclosures were ouerthrowne againe by the Saxons &amp; Danes, as
Cauisham, Towner, and Woodstocke, beside other in the west countrie, and
one also at Bolton. Among other things also to be seene in that towne,
there is one of the fairest clockes in Europe. Where no wood is, they
are also inclosed with piles of slate; and therto it is doubted of manie
whether our bucke or doe are to be reckoned in wild or tame beasts or
not. Plinie deemeth them to be wild, Martial is also of the same
opinion, where he saith, "Imbelles damæ quid nisi præda sumus?" And so
in time past the like controuersie was about bées, which the lawiers
call "Feras," tit. de acquirendo rerum dominio, &amp; lib. 2. instit. But
Plinie attempting to decide the quarell calleth them "Medias inter feras
&amp; placidas aues." But whither am I so suddenlie digressed? In returning
therefore vnto our parks, I find also the circuit of these inclosures in
like manner conteine often times a walke of foure or fiue miles, and
sometimes more or lesse. Wherby it is to be séene what store of ground
<span class="page"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[Page 344]</span>
is emploied vpon that vaine commoditie, which bringeth no manner of
gaine or profit to the owner, sith they commonlie giue awaie their
flesh, neuer taking penie for the same, except the ordinarie fée and
parts of the déere giuen vnto the kéeper by a custome, who beside three
shillings foure pence, or fiue shillings in monie, hath the skin, head,
vmbles, chine, and shoulders: whereby he that hath the warrant for an
whole bucke, hath in the end little more than halfe, which in my
iudgement is scarselie equall dealing; for venison in England is neither
bought nor sold, as in other countries, but mainteined onelie for the
pleasure of the owner and his friends. Albeit I heard of late of one
ancient ladie, which maketh a great game by selling yeerelie hir
husbands venison to the cookes (as another of no lesse name will not
sticke to ride to the market to sée hir butter sold) but not performed
without infinite scoffes and mockes, euen of the poorest pezzants of the
countrie, who thinke them as odious matters in ladies and women of such
countenance to sell their venison and their butter, as for an earle to
feele his oxen, sheepe, and lambs, whether they be readie for the
butcher or not, or to sell his wooll vnto the clothier, or to kéepe a
tan-house, or deale with such like affaires as belong not to men of
honor, but rather to farmers, or grasiers; for which such, if there be
anie may well be noted (and not vniustlie) to degenerate from true
nobilitie, and betake themselues to husbandrie. And euen the same
enormitie tooke place sometime among the Romans, and entred so farre as
into the verie senate, of whome some one had two or thrée ships going
vpon the sea, pretending prouision for their houses; but in truth
following the trades of merchandize, till a law was made which did
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'inhabit'">inhibit</ins> and restraine them. Liuie also telleth of another law which
passed likewise against the senators by Claudius the tribune, and helpe
onelie of C. Flaminius, that no senator, or he that had beene father to
anie senator should possesse anie ship or vessell aboue the capacitie of
thrée hundred amphoras, which was supposed sufficient for the cariage
and recariage of such necessities as should apperteine vnto his house:
sith further trading with merchandizes and commodities dooth declare but
a base and couetous mind, not altogither void of enuie, that anie man
should liue but he; or that if anie gaine were to be had, he onelie
would haue it himselfe: which is a wonderfull dealing, and must néeds
<span class="leftnote">Tillage and mankind diminished by parkes.</span>
proue in time the confusion of that countrie wherein such enormities are
exercised. Where in times past, manie large and wealthie occupiers were
dwelling within the compasse of some one parke, and thereby great
plentie of corne and cattell séene, and to be had among them, beside a
more copious procreation of humane issue, whereby the realme was alwaies
better furnished with able men to serue the prince in his affaires: now
there is almost nothing kept but a sort of wild and sauage beasts,
cherished for pleasure and delight; and yet some owners still desirous
to inlarge those grounds, as either for the bréed and feeding of
cattell, doo not let dailie to take in more, not sparing the verie
commons whervpon manie towneships now and then doo liue, affirming that
we haue alreadie too great store of people in England; and that youth by
marrieng too soone doo nothing profit the countrie, but fill it full of
beggars, to the hurt and vtter vndooing (they saie) of the common
wealth.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">The decaie of the people is the destruction of a kingdome.</span>
Certes if it be not one curse of the Lord, to haue our countrie
conuerted in such sort from the furniture of mankind, into the walks and
shrowds of wild beasts, I know not what is anie. How manie families also
these great and small games (for so most kéepers call them) haue eaten
vp and are likelie hereafter to deuoure, some men may coniecture, but
manie more lament, sith there is no hope of restraint to be looked for
in this behalfe, because the corruption is so generall. But if a man may
presentlie giue a ghesse at the vniuersalitie of this euill by
contemplation of the circumstance, he shall saie at the last, that the
twentith part of the realme is imploied vpon déere and conies alreadie,
which séemeth verie much if it be not dulie considered of.</p>

<p>King Henrie the eight, one of the noblest princes that euer reigned in
this land, lamented oft that he was constreined to hire forren aid, for
want of competent store of souldiors here at home, perceiuing (as it is
indeed) that such supplies are oftentimes more hurtfull than profitable
vnto those that interteine them, as may chéeflie be seene in Valens the
<span class="page"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[Page 345]</span>
emperor, our Vortiger, and no small number of others. He would oft
maruell in priuate talke, how that when seauen or eight princes ruled
here at once, one of them could lead thirtie or fortie thousand men to
the field against another, or two of them 100000 against the third, and
those taken out onelie of their owne dominions. But as he found the
want, so he saw not the cause of this decaie, which grew beside this
occasion now mentioned, also by laieng house to house, and land to land,
whereby manie mens occupiengs were conuerted into one, and the bréed of
people not a little thereby diminished. The auarice of landlords by
increasing of rents and fines also did so wearie the people, that they
were readie to rebell with him that would arise, supposing a short end
in the warres to be better than a long and miserable life in peace.</p>

<p>Priuileges and faculties also are another great cause of the ruine of a
common wealth, and diminution of mankind: for whereas law and nature
dooth permit all men to liue in their best maner, and whatsoeuer trade
they be exercised in, there commeth some priuilege or other in the waie,
which cutteth them off from this or that trade, wherby they must néeds
shift soile, and séeke vnto other countries. By these also the greatest
commodities are brought into the hands of few, who imbase, corrupt, and
yet raise the prices of things at their owne pleasures. Example of this
last I can giue also in bookes, which (after the first impression of
anie one booke) are for the most part verie negligentlie handled:
whereas if another might print it so well as the first, then would men
striue which of them should doo it best; and so it falleth out in all
other trades. It is an easie matter to prooue that England was neuer
lesse furnished with people than at this present; for if the old records
of euerie manour be sought, and search made to find what tenements are
fallen, either downe, or into the lords hands, or brought and vnited
togither by other men: it will soone appéere, that in some one manour
seuentéen, eightéene, or twentie houses are shrunke. I know what I saie
by mine owne experience: notwithstanding that some one cotage be here
and there erected of late, which is to little purpose. Of cities and
townes either vtterlie decaied, or more than a quarter or halfe
diminished, though some one be a little increased here and there; of
townes pulled downe for sheepe-walks, and no more but the lordships now
standing in them, beside those that William Rufus pulled downe in his
time; I could saie somewhat: but then I should swarue yet further from
my purpose, wherevnto I now returne.</p>

<p>Wée had no parkes left in England at the comming of the Normans, who
added this calamitie also to the seruitude of our nation, making men of
the best sort furthermore to become kéepers of their game, whilest they
liued in the meane time vpon the spoile of their reuenues, and dailie
ouerthrew townes, villages, and an infinit sort of families, for the
maintenance of their venerie. Neither was anie parke supposed in these
times to be statelie enough, that conteined not at the least eight or
ten hidelands, that is, so manie hundred acres or families (or as they
haue béene alwaies called in some places of the realme carrucats or
cartwares) of which one was sufficient in old time to mainteine an
honest yeoman.</p>

<p>King Iohn trauelling on a time northwards, to wit 1209 to warre vpon the
king of Scots, because he had married his daughter to the earle of
Bullen without his consent: in his returne ouerthrew a great number of
parkes and warrens, of which some belonged to his barons, but the
greatest part to the abbats and prelats of the cleargie. For hearing (as
he trauelled) by complaint of the countrie, how these inclosures were
the chéefe decaie of men, and of tillage in the land, he sware with an
oth that he would not suffer wild beasts to féed vpon the fat of his
soile, and sée the people perish for want of abilitie to procure and
buie them food that should defend the realme. Howbeit, this act of his
was so ill taken by the religious and their adherents, that they
inuerted his intent herein to another end; affirming most slanderouslie
how he did it rather of purpose to spoile the corne and grasse of the
commons and catholikes that held against him of both estates, and by so
doing to impouerish and bring the north part of the realme to
destruction, because they refused to go with him into Scotland. If the
said prince were aliue in these daies, wherein Andrew Boord saith there
are more parks in England than in all Europe (ouer which he trauelled in
<span class="page"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[Page 346]</span>
his owne person) and saw how much ground they consume, I thinke he would
either double his othes, or laie the most of them open that tillage
might be better looked vnto. But this I hope shall not néed in time, for
the owners of a great sort of them begin now to smell out, that such
parcels might be emploied to their more game, and therefore some of them
doo grow to be disparked.</p>

<p>Next of all we haue the franke chase, which taketh something both of
parke and forrest, and is giuen either by the kings grant or
prescription. Certes it differeth not much from a parke; nay, it is in
maner the selfe same thing that a parke is, sauing that a parke is
inuironed with pale, wall, or such like: the chase alwaie open and
nothing at all inclosed, as we see in Enuéeld &amp; Maluerne chases. And as
it is the cause of the seisure of the franchise of a parke not to kéepe
the same inclosed, so it is the like in a chase if at anie time it be
imparked. It is trespasse, and against the law also, for anie man to
haue or make a chase, parke, or frée warren without good warrantie of
the king by his charter or perfect title of prescription: for it is not
lawfull for anie subiect either to carnilate, that is, build stone
houses, imbattell, haue the querke of the sea, or kéepe the assise of
bread, ale, or wine, or set vp furels, tumbrell, thew, or pillorie, or
inclose anie ground to the aforesaid purposes within his owne soile,
without his warrant and grant. The beasts of the chase were commonlie
the bucke, the roe, the fox, and the marterne. But those of venerie in
old time were the hart, the hare, the bore and the woolfe; but as this
held not in the time of Canutus, so in stéed of the woolfe the beare is
now crept in, which is a beast comonlie hunted in the east countries,
and fed vpon as excellent venison, although with vs I know not anie that
féed thereon or care for it at all. Certes it should seeme, that
forrests and franke chases haue alwaies béene had, and religiouslie
preserued in this Iland for the solace of the prince, and recreation of
his nobilitie: howbeit I read not that euer they were inclosed more than
at this present, or otherwise fensed than by vsuall notes of limitation,
whereby their bounds were remembred from time to time, for the better
preseruation of such venerie and vert of all sorts as were nourished in
the same. Neither are anie of the ancient laws prescribed for their
maintenance, before the daies of Canutus, now to be had; sith time hath
so dealt with them that they are perished and lost. Canutus therefore
seeing the dailie spoile that was made almost in all places of his game,
did at the last make sundrie sanctions and decrées, whereby from
thenceforth the red and fallow déere were better looked to throughout
his whole dominions. We haue in these daies diuerse forrests in England
and Wales, of which, some belong to the king, and some to his subiects,
as Waltham forrest, Windlesor, Pickering, Fecknam, Delamore, Gillingham,
Kingswood, Wencedale, Clun, Rath, Bredon, Weire, Charlie, Leircester,
Lée, Rokingham, Selwood, New forrest, Wichwood, Hatfeeld, Sauernake,
Westbirie, Blacamore Peke, Deane, Penrise, &amp; manie other now cleane out
of my remembrance: and which although they are far greater in circuit
than manie parkes and warrens, yet are they in this our time lesse
deuourers of the people than these latter, sith beside much tillage, &amp;
manie townes are found in each of them, wheras in parks and warrens we
haue nothing else than either the keepers &amp; wareners lodge, or at least
the manor place of the chéef lord &amp; owner of the soile. I find also by
good record, that all Essex hath in time past wholie béene forrest
ground, except one cantred or hundred; but how long it is since it lost
the said denomination in good sooth I doo not read. This neuerthelesse
remaineth yet in memorie, that the towne of Walden in Essex standing in
the limits of the aforesaid countie doth take hir name thereof. For in
the Celtike toong, wherewith the Saxon or Scithian spéech dooth not a
little participate, huge woods and forrests were called Walds, and
likewise their Druides were named Walie or Waldie, bicause they
frequented the woods, and there made sacrifice among the okes and
thickets. So that if my coniecture in this behalfe be anie thing at all,
the aforesaid towne taketh denomination of Wald and end, as if I should
say, The end of the wooddie soile; for being once out of that parish,
the champaine is at hand. Or it may be that it is so called of Wald and
dene: for I haue read it written in old euidences Waldæne, with a
diphthong. And to saie truth, Dene is the old Saxon word for a vale or
<span class="page"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>[Page 347]</span>
lowe bottome, as Dune or Don is for an hill or hillie soile. Certes if
it be so, then Walden taketh hir name of the woodie vale, in which it
sometime stood. But the first deriuation liketh me better, and the
highest part of the towne is called also Chipping Walden, of the Saxon
<span class="leftnote">Gipping, of going vp to anie place.</span>
word <ins title="Saxon: g(h)ipping">&#7545;ipping</ins>, which signifieth Leaning or hanging, and may verie well be
applied therevnto, sith the whole towne hangeth as it were vpon the
sides of two hils, wherof the lesser runneth quite through the middest
of the same. I might here for further confirmation of these things bring
in mention of the Wald of Kent: but this may suffice for the vse of the
word Wald, which now differeth much from Wold. For as that signifieth a
woodie soile, so this betokeneth a soile without wood, or plaine
champaine countrie, without anie store of trées, as may be seene in
Cotswold, Porkewold, &amp;c. Beside this I could saie more of our forrests,
and the aforesaid inclosures also, &amp; therein to prooue by the booke of
forrest law, that the whole countie of Lancaster hath likewise beene
forrest heretofore. Also how William the Bastard made a law, that
whosoeuer did take anie wild beast within the kings forrest should lose
an eare; as Henrie the first did punish them either by life or lim:
which ordinance was confirmed by Henrie the second and his péeres at
Woodstocke, wherevpon great trouble insued vnder king Iohn and Henrie
the third, as appeareth by the chronicles: but it shall suffice to haue
said so much as is set downe alreadie.</p>

<p>Howbeit, that I may restore one antiquitie to light, which hath hitherto
lien as it were raked vp in the embers of obliuion, I will giue out
those laws that Canutus made for his forrest: whereby manie things shall
be disclosed concerning the same (wherof peraduenture some lawiers haue
no knowledge) and diuerse other notes gathered touching the ancient
estate of the realme not to be found in other. But before I deale with
the great charter (which as you may perceiue, is in manie places
vnperfect by reason of corruption, and want also of congruitie, crept in
by length of time, not by me to be restored) I will note another breefe
law, which he made in the first yeare of his reigne at Winchester,
afterward inserted into these his later constitutions, canon 32, &amp;
beginneth thus in his owne Saxon tong; "Ic will that elc one," &amp;c: I
will and grant that ech one shall be worthie of such venerie as he by
hunting can take either in the plaines or in the woods, within his owne
fée or dominion; but ech man shall abstaine from my venerie in euerie
place, where I will that my beasts shall haue firme peace and
quietnesse, vpon paine to forfet so much as a man may forfet. Hitherto
the statute made by the aforesaid Canutus, which was afterward confirmed
by king Edward surnamed the Confessor; &amp; ratified by the Bastard in the
fourth yeare of his reigne. Now followeth the great charter it selfe in
such rude order and Latine as I find it word for word, and which I would
gladlie haue turned into English, if it might haue sounded to anie
benefit of the vnskilfull and vnlearned.</p>

<small>OF GARDENS AND ORCHARDS.</small><br />

CHAP. XX.</h3>

<p>After such time as Calis was woone from the French, and that our
countriemen had learned to trade into diuerse countries (wherby they
grew rich) they began to wax idle also, and therevpon not onlie left off
their former painfulnesse and frugalitie, but in like sort gaue
themselues to liue in excesse and vanitie, whereby manie goodlie
commodities failed, and in short time were not to be had amongst vs.
Such strangers also as dwelled here with vs, perceiuing our
sluggishnesse, and espieng that this idlenesse of ours might redound to
their great profit, foorthwith imploied their endeuours to bring in the
supplie of such things as we lacked, continuallie from forren countries;
which yet more augmented our idlenes. For hauing all things at
reasonable prices as we supposed, by such means from them, we thought it
méere madnesse to spend either time or cost about the same here at home.
And thus we became enimies to our owne welfare, as men that in those
daies reposed our felicitie in following the wars, wherewith we were
often exercised both at home and other places. Besides this, the
naturall desire that mankind hath to estéeme of things farre sought,
bicause they be rare and costlie, and the irkesome contempt of things
néere hand, for that they are common and plentifull, hath borne no small
swaie also in this behalfe amongst vs. For hereby we haue neglected our
owne good gifts of God, growing here at home as vile and of no valure,
and had euerie trifle and toie in admiration that is brought hither from
far countries, ascribing I wot not what great forces and solemne
estimation vnto them, vntill they also haue waxen old, after which they
haue béene so little regarded, if not more despised amongst vs than our
owne. Examples hereof I could set downe manie, &amp; in manie things, but
sith my purpose is to deale at this time with gardens and orchards, it
shall suffice that I touch them onelie, and shew our inconstancie in the
same, so farre as shall séeme &amp; be conuenient for my turne. I comprehend
therefore vnder the word garden, all such grounds as are wrought with
the spade by mans hand, for so the case requireth. Of wine I haue
written alreadie elsewhere sufficientlie, which commoditie (as I haue
learned further since the penning of that booke) hath beene verie
plentifull in this Iland, not onlie in the time of the Romans, but also
since the conquest, as I haue séene by record: yet at this present haue
we none at all or else verie little to speake of growing in this Iland:
which I impute not vnto the soile, but the negligence of my countrimen.
Such herbes, fruits, and roots also as grow yéerelie out of the ground,
of seed, haue béene verie plentifull in this land, in the time of the
first Edward, and after his daies: but in processe of time they grew
also to be neglected, so that from Henrie the fourth till the latter end
of Henrie the seuenth, &amp; beginning of Henrie the eight, there was litle
or no vse of them in England, but they remained either vnknowne, or
supposed as food more méet for hogs &amp; sauage beasts to feed vpon than
mankind. Whereas in my time their vse is not onelie resumed among the
poore commons, I meane of melons, pompions, gourds, cucumbers, radishes,
skirets, parsneps, carrets, cabbages, nauewes, turneps, and all kinds of
salad herbes, but also fed vpon as deintie dishes at the tables of
delicate merchants, gentlemen, and the nobilitie, who make their
prouision yearelie for new séeds out of strange countries, from whence
they haue them aboundantlie. Neither doo they now staie with such of
these fruits as are wholesome in their kinds, but aduenture further vpon
such as are verie dangerous and hurtfull, as the verangenes, mushroms,
&amp;c: as if nature had ordeined all for the bellie, or that all things
were to be eaten, for whose mischiefous operation the Lord in some
measure hath giuen and prouided a remedie.</p>

<p>Hops in time past were plentifull in this land, afterwards also their
maintenance did cease, and now being reuiued, where are anie better to
be found? where anie greater commoditie to be raised by them? onelie
poles are accounted to be their greatest charge. But sith men haue
learned of late to sow ashen keies in ashyards by themselues, that
<span class="page"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>[Page 351]</span>
inconuenience in short time will be redressed. Madder hath growne
abundantlie in this Iland, but of long time neglected, and now a little
reuiued, and offereth it selfe to prooue no small benefit vnto our
countrie, as manie other things else, which are now fetched from vs; as
we before time when we gaue ourselues to idlenesse, were glad to haue
them other. If you looke into our gardens annexed to our houses, how
woonderfullie is their beautie increased, not onelie with floures, which
Colmella calleth <em>Terrena sydera</em>, saieng:</p>

<p class="ind1">"Pingit &amp; in varios terrestria sydera flores,"</p>

<p>and varietie of curious and costlie workmanship, but also with rare and
medicinable hearbes sought vp in the land within these fortie yeares: so
that in comparison of this present, the ancient gardens were but
dunghils and laistowes to such as did possesse them. How art also
helpeth nature in the dailie colouring, dubling and inlarging the
proportion of our floures, it is incredible to report: for so curious
and cunning are our gardeners now in these daies, that they presume to
doo in maner what they list with nature, and moderate hir course in
things as if they were hir superiours. It is a world also to sée, how
manie strange hearbs, plants, and annuall fruits, are dailie brought
vnto vs from the Indies, Americans, Taprobane, Canarie Iles, and all
parts of the world: the which albeit that in respect of the
constitutions of our bodies they doo not grow for vs, bicause that God
hath bestowed sufficient commodities vpon euerie countrie for hir owne
necessitie; yet for delectation sake vnto the eie, and their odoriferous
sauours vnto the nose, they are to be cherished, and God to be glorified
also in them, bicause they are his good gifts, and created to doo man
helpe and seruice. There is not almost one noble man, gentleman, or
merchant, that hath not great store of these floures, which now also doo
begin to wax so well acquainted with our soiles, that we may almost
accompt of them as parcell of our owne commodities. They haue no lesse
regard in like sort to cherish medicinable hearbs fetched out of other
regions néerer hand: insomuch that I haue séene in some one garden to
the number of three hundred or foure hundred of them, if not more; of
the halfe of whose names within fortie yéeres passed we had no maner
knowledge. But herein I find some cause of iust complaint, for that we
extoll their vses so farre that we fall into contempt of our owne, which
are in truth more beneficiall and apt for vs than such as grow
elsewhere, sith (as I said before) euerie region hath abundantlie within
hir owne limits whatsoeuer is needfull and most conuenient for them that
dwell therein. How doo men extoll the vse of Tabacco in my time, whereas
in truth (whether the cause be in the repugnancie of our constitution
vnto the operation thereof, or that the ground dooth alter hir force, I
cannot tell) it is not found of so great efficacie as they write. And
beside this, our common germander or thistle benet is found &amp; knowne to
bée so wholesome and of so great power in medicine, as anie other
hearbe, if they be vsed accordinglie. I could exemplifie after the like
maner in sundrie other, as the Salsa parilla, Mochoacan, &amp;c: but I
forbeare so to doo, because I couet to be bréefe. And trulie the
estimation and credit that we yéeld and giue vnto compound medicines
made with forren drugs, is one great cause wherefore the full knowledge
and vse of our owne simples hath bene so long raked vp in the imbers.
And as this may be verified, so to be one sound conclusion, for the
greater number of simples that go vnto anie compound medicine, the
greater confusion is found therein, because the qualities and operations
of verie few of the particulars are throughlie knowne. And euen so our
continuall desire of strange drugs, whereby the physician and
apothecarie onlie hath the benefit, is no small cause that the vse of
our simples here at home dooth go to losse, and that we tread those
herbes vnder our féet, whose forces if we knew, &amp; could applie them to
our necessities, we wold honor &amp; haue in reuerence as to their case
behooueth. Alas what haue we to doo with such Arabian &amp; Grecian stuffe
as is dailie brought from those parties, which lie in another clime? And
therefore the bodies of such as dwell there, are of another
constitution, than ours are here at home. Certes they grow not for vs,
but for the Arabians and Grecians. And albeit that they maie by skill be
applied vnto our benefit, yet to be more skilfull in them than in our
<span class="page"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[Page 352]</span>
owne, is follie; and to vse forren wares when our owne maie serue the
turne is more follie; but to despise our owne and magnifie aboue measure
the vse of them that are sought and brought from farre, is most follie
of all: for it sauoureth of ignorance, or at the leastwise of
negligence, and therefore woorthie of reproch.</p>

<p>Among the Indians, who haue the most present cures for euerie disease,
of their owne nation, there is small regard of compound medicins, &amp;
lesse of forren drugs, because they neither know them nor can vse them,
but worke woonders euen with their owne simples. With them also the
difference of the clime dooth shew hir full effect. For whereas they
will heale one another in short time with application of one simple, &amp;c:
if a Spaniard or English man stand in need of their helpe, they are
driuen to haue a longer space in their cures, and now and then also to
vse some addition of two or thrée simples at the most, whose forces vnto
them are throughlie knowne, because their exercise is onelie in their
owne, as men that neuer sought or heard what vertue was in those that
came from other countries. And euen so did Marcus Cato the learned Roman
indeuor to deale in his cures of sundrie diseases, wherein he not onelie
vsed such simples as were to be had in his owne countrie, but also
examined and learned the forces of each of them, wherewith he dealt so
diligentlie, that in all his life time, he could atteine to the exact
knowledge but of a few, and thereto wrote of those most learnedlie, as
would easilie be séene, if those his bookes were extant. For the space
also of 600 yéeres, the colewort onelie was a medicine in Rome for all
diseases, so that his vertues were thoroughlie knowne in those parts.</p>

<p>In Plinies time the like affection to forren drugs did rage among the
Romans, whereby their owne did grow in contempt. Crieng out therefore of
this extreame follie, lib. 22. cap. 24, he speaketh after this maner:
"Non placent remedia tam longè nascentia, non enim nobis gignuntur, immò
ne illis quidem, alioquin non venderent; si placet etiam superstitionis
gratiâ emantur, quoniam supplicamus, &amp;c. Salutem quidem sine his posse
constare, vel ob id probabimus, vt tanto magis sui tandem pudeat." For
my part I doubt not, if the vse of outlandish drugs had not blinded our
physicians of England in times passed, but that the vertues of our
simples here at home would haue béene far better knowne, and so well
vnto vs, as those of India are to the practisioners of those partes, and
therevnto be found more profitable for vs than the forren either are or
maie be. This also will I ad, that euen those which are most common by
reason of their plentie, and most vile bicause of their abundance, are
not without some vniuersall and especiall efficacie, if it were knowne,
for our benefit: sith God in nature hath so disposed his creatures, that
the most néedfull are the most plentifull, and seruing for such generall
diseases as our constitution most commonlie is affected withall. Great
thanks therefore be giuen vnto the physicians of our age and countrie,
who not onelie indeuour to search out the vse of such simples as our
soile dooth yéeld and bring foorth, but also to procure such as grow
elsewhere, vp&#333; purpose so to acquaint them with our clime, that they
in time through some alteration receiued from the nature of the earth,
maie likewise turne to our benefit and commoditie, and be vsed as our
owne.</p>

<p>The chiefe workeman, or as I maie call him the founder of this deuise,
is Carolus Clusius, the noble herbarist, whose industrie hath
woonderfullie stirred them vp vnto this good act. For albeit that
Matthiolus, Rembert, Lobell, and other haue trauelled verie farre in
this behalfe, yet none hath come néere to Clusius, much lesse gone
further in the finding and true descriptions of such herbes as of late
are brought to light. I doubt not but if this man were in England but
one seuen yéeres, he would reueale a number of herbes growing with vs,
whereof neither our physicians nor apothecaries as yet haue anie
knowledge. And euen like thankes be giuen vnto our nobilitie, gentlemen,
and others, for their continuall nutriture and cherishing of such
homeborne and forren simples in their gardens, for hereby they shall not
onlie be had at hand and preserued, but also their formes made more
familiar to be discerned, and their forces better knowne than hitherto
they haue béene.</p>

<p>And euen as it fareth with our gardens, so dooth it with our orchards,
which were neuer furnished with so good fruit, nor with such varietie as
<span class="page"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>[Page 353]</span>
at this present. For beside that we haue most delicate apples, plummes,
peares, walnuts, filberds, &amp;c: and those of sundrie sorts, planted
within fortie yéeres passed, in comparison of which most of the old
trées are nothing woorth: so haue we no lesse store of strange fruit, as
abricotes, almonds, peaches, figges, corne-trees in noble mens orchards.
I haue seene capers, orenges, and lemmons, and heard of wild oliues
growing here, beside other strange trees, brought from far, whose names
I know not. So that England for these commodities was neuer better
furnished, neither anie nation vnder their clime more plentifullie
indued with these and other blessings from the most high God, who grant
vs grace withall to vse the same to his honour and glorie! and not as
instruments and prouocations vnto further excesse and vanitie, wherewith
his displeasure may be kindled, least these his benefits doo turne vnto
thornes and briers vnto vs for our annoiance and punishment, which he
hath bestowed vpon vs for our consolation and comfort.</p>

<p>We haue in like sort such workemen as are not onelie excellent in
graffing the naturall fruits, but also in their artificiall mixtures,
whereby one trée bringeth foorth sundrie fruits, and one and the same
fruit of diuers colours and tasts, dallieng as it were with nature and
hir course, as if hir whole trade were perfectlie knowne vnto them: of
hard fruits they will make tender, of sowre sweet, of sweet yet more
delicate, béereuing also some of their kernels, other of their cores,
and finallie induing them with the sauour of muske, ambre, or swéet
spices at their pleasures. Diuerse also haue written at large of these
seuerall practises, and some of them how to conuert the kernels of
peaches into almonds, of small fruit to make farre greater, and to
remooue or ad superfluous or necessarie moisture to the trées, with
other things belonging to their preseruation, and with no lesse
diligence than our physicians doo commonlie shew vpon our owne diseased
bodies, which to me dooth seeme right strange. And euen so doo our
gardeners with their herbes, whereby they are strengthened against
noisome blasts, and preserued from putrifaction and hinderance, whereby
some such as were annuall, are now made perpetuall, being yéerelie taken
vp, and either reserued in the house, or hauing the rosse pulled from
their rootes, laid againe into the earth, where they remaine in safetie.
What choise they make also in their waters, and wherewith some of them
doo now and then keepe them moist, it is a world to sée; insomuch that
the apothecaries shops maie séeme to be needfull also to our gardens and
orchards, and that in sundrie wise: naie the kitchin it selfe is so
farre from being able to be missed among them, that euen the verie
dishwater is not without some vse amongest our finest plants. Whereby
and sundrie other circumstances not here to bée remembred, I am
persuaded, that albeit the gardens of the Hesperides were in times past
so greatlie accounted of because of their delicacie: yet if it were
possible to haue such an equall iudge, as by certeine knowledge of both
were able to pronounce vpon them, I doubt not but he would giue the
price vnto the gardens of our daies, and generallie ouer all Europe, in
comparison of those times, wherein the old exceeded. Plinie and other
speake of a rose that had thrée score leaues growing vpon one button:
but if I should tell of one which bare a triple number vnto that
proportion, I know I shall not be beléeued, and no great matter though I
were not, howbeit such a one was to be séene in Antwarpe 1585, as I haue
heard, and I know who might haue had a slip or stallon thereof, if he
would haue ventured ten pounds vpon the growth of the same, which should
haue bene but a tickle hazard, and therefore better vndoone, as I did
alwaies imagine. For mine owne part, good reader, let me boast a litle
of my garden, which is but small, and the whole Area thereof little
aboue 300 foot of ground, and yet, such hath béene my good lucke in
purchase of the varietie of simples, that notwithstanding my small
abilitie, there are verie néere thrée hundred of one sort and other
conteined therein, no one of them being common or vsuallie to bee had.
If therefore my little plot, void of all cost in keeping be so well
furnished, what shall we thinke of those of Hampton court, Nonesuch,
Tibaults, Cobham garden, and sundrie other apperteining to diuerse
citizens of London, whom I could particularlie name, if I should not
séeme to offend them by such my demeanour and dealing?</p>

<small>OF WATERS GENERALLIE.</small><br />

CHAP. XXI.</h3>

<p>There is no one commoditie in England, whereof I can make lesse report
than of our waters. For albeit our soile abound with water in all
places, and that in the most ample maner: yet can I not find by some
experience that almost anie one of our riuers hath such od and rare
qualities as diuers of the maine are said to be indued withall.
Virtruuius writeth of a well in Paphlagonia, whose water séemeth as it
were mixed with wine, &amp; addeth thereto that diuerse become drunke by
superfluous taking of the same. The like force is found <em>In amne Licesio</em>,
a riuer of Thracia, vpon whose bankes a man shall hardlie misse to find
some traueller or other sléeping for drunkennesse, by drinking of that
liquor. Néere also vnto Ephesus are certeine welles, which taste like
sharpe vineger, and therefore are much esteemed of by such as are sicke
and euill at ease in those parts. At Hieropolis is a spring of such
force (as Strabo saith) that the water thereof mixed with certaine
herbes of choise, dooth colour wooll with such a glosse, that the die
thereof contendeth with scarlet, murreie, and purple, and oft
ouercommeth the same. The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Cydims'">Cydnus</ins> in Tarsus of Cilicia, is of such
vertue, that who so batheth himselfe therein, shall find great ease of
the gowt that runneth ouer all his ioints. In one of the fortunate Iles
(saith Pomponius the Cosmographer) are two springs, one of the which
bringeth immoderate laughter to him that drinketh thereof, the other
sadnesse and restraint of that effect, whereby the last is taken to be a
souereigne medicine against the other, to the great admiration of such
as haue beholden it. At Susis in Persia there is a spring, which maketh
him that drinketh downe anie of the water, to cast all his téeth: but if
he onlie wash his mouth withall, it maketh them fast, &amp; his mouth to be
verie healthfull. So there is a riuer among the Gadarens, wherof if a
beast drinke, he foorthwith casteth hoofe, haire, and hornes, if he haue
anie. Also a lake in Assyria, neere vnto the which there is a kind of
glewie matter to be found, which holdeth such birds as by hap doo light
thereon so fast as birdlime, by means wherof verie manie doo perish and
are taken that light vpon the same: howbeit if anie portion hereof
happen to be set on fire by casualtie or otherwise, it will neuer be
quenched but by casting on of dust, as Caietanus dooth report. Another
at Halicarnassus called Salmacis, which is noted to make such men
effeminate as drinke of the water of the same. Certes it maie be (saith
Strabo) that the water and aire of a region maie qualifie the courage of
some men, but none can make them effeminate, nor anie other thing
because of such corruption in them, sooner than superfluous wealth, and
inconstancie of liuing and behauiour, which is a bane vnto all nature,
lib. 4. All which, with manie other not now comming to memorie, as the
Letheus, Styx, Phlegeton, Cocitus, &amp;c: haue strange &amp; incredible reports
made of them by the new and ancient writers, the like wherof are not to
be found in England, which I impute wholie to the blessing of God, who
hath ordeined nothing amongst vs in this our temperate region, but that
which is good, wholesome, and most commodious for our nation. We haue
therefore no hurtfull waters amongst vs, but all wholesome and
profitable for the benefit of the people. Neuertheles as none of them is
to be found without hir fish: so we know by experience, that diuerse
turne ash, some other elme, and oken stakes or poles that lie or are
throwne into them into hard stone, in long continuance of time, which is
the strangest thing that I can learne at this present wherevpon to rest
for a certentie. Yet I read of diuerse welles, wherevnto our old writers
ascribe either wonderfull vertues, or rare courses, as of one vpon the
shore, beyond the which the sea floweth euerie daie twise a large mile
and more; and yet is the surge of that water alwaies seuen foot from the
salt sea: whereby it should séeme that the head of the spring is
mooueable. But alas I doo not easilie beleeue it, more than that which
is written of the Lilingwan lake in Wales, which is néere to the
Seuerne, and receiueth the flowing sea into hir chanell as it were a
gulfe, and yet is neuer full: but when the sea goeth awaie by reason of
<span class="page"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[Page 355]</span>
the ebbe, it casteth vp the water with such violence, that hir banks are
ouerflowne and drowned, which is an absurd report. They ad also, that if
all the people of the countrie stood neere to the same, with their faces
toward the lake, in such maner that the dashing of the water might touch
and wet their clothes, they should haue no power to go from thence, but
mawgre their resistance be drawne into that gulfe and perish; whereas if
they turned their backs vnto the same, they should suffer no such
inconuenience though they stood neuer so néere. Manie other such like
toies I could set downe of other welles and waters of our countrie. But
whie should I write that for other men to read, whereto I giue no credit
my selfe, more than to the report which Iohannes du Choul dooth make in
his description of Pilots lake, "In monte Pilati in Gallia," or
Boccatius of the Scaphigiolo in the Appenine hils, or F&oelig;lix Malliolus
of Pilats lake "In monte fracto" (where Iacobus de Voragino bishop of
Gene, &amp; Ioachimus Vadianus in Pompon. Melam doo also make mention) sith
I take them but for fables, &amp; far vnworthie that anie good man should
staine his paper with such friuolous matters as are reported of them,
being deuised at the first by Satanas the father of lies, for the
holding of the ignorant &amp; credulous in their superstitions and errors.
Such also is the tale that goeth of Wenefrids well, &amp; nothing inferior
to that of Mercurie néere to port Caperia in Rome, wherein such as went
by would dip branches of baie, and sprinkle the same vpon themselues:
and so manie as stood about them, calling vpon Mercurie, and crauing
pardon for their sinnes, as if that ceremonie had bene of force vnto
forgiuenesse and remission of their trespasses. And so it appeareth
partlie by Cicero, who (being a man neither thinking well of their owne
gods nor liking of the augures) dooth write in his first De legibus
(except my memorie faile me) "aspersione aquæ labem tolli corpoream, &amp;
castimoniam corporis præstari," which maketh me to thinke further, that
they thought it equall with our late holie-water, wherewith it maie be
compared. I might further also (if I would) make relation of diuerse
welles, which haue wrought manie miracles in time of superstition, as S.
Butolphs well in Hadstocke, S. Germans well at Falkeburne, Holie well at
S. Albones and London, and sundrie other in other places: but as their
vertues are now found out to be but baits to draw men and women vnto
them, either for gaine vnto the places where they were, or satisfaction
of the lewd disposition of such as hunted after other gaine, so it shall
suffice to haue touched them far off. Onlie this will I ad, that we haue
no hurtfull waters, no not vnto our shéepe, though it please Cardan to
auouch otherwise; for our waters are not the causes, but the signes of
their infections when they drinke, as I elsewhere haue noted in the
chapter of cattell, as also that we haue a spring neere Saffron Walden,
and not farre from the house of the lord Audleie, which is of such
force, that it looseth the bodie of him that drinketh therof in verie
gentle maner, and beside that is verie delectable &amp; pleasant to be
taken, as I haue found by experience. I heare also of two welles néere
London, of which the one is verie excellent water, the other will beare
no sope, and yet so situat that the one is hard by the other. And thus
much of waters.</p>

<small>OF WOODS AND MARISHES.</small><br />

CHAP. XXII.</h3>

<p>
It should séeme by ancient records,
<span class="leftnote">Great abundance of wood sometime in England.</span>
and the testimonie of sundrie
authors, that the whole countries of Lhoegres and Cambria, now England
and Wales, haue sometimes béene verie well replenished with great woods
&amp; groues, although at this time the said commoditie be not a little
decaied in both, and in such wise that a man shall oft ride ten or
twentie miles in ech of them, and find verie little or rather none at
all, except it be néere vnto townes, gentlemens houses, &amp; villages,
where the inhabitants haue planted a few elmes, okes, hazels, or ashes
about their dwellings for their defense from the rough winds, and
keeping of the stormie weather from annoiance of the same. This
scarsitie at the first grew (as it is thought) either by the industrie
<span class="page"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[Page 356]</span>
of man, for maintenance of tillage (as we vnderstand the like to be
doone of late by the Spaniards in the west Indies, where they fired
whole woods of verie great compasse therby to come by ground whereon to
sow their graines) or else thorough the couetousnesse of such, as in
preferring of pasture for their shéepe and greater cattell, doo make
small account of firebote and timber: or finallie by the crueltie of the
enimies, whereof we haue sundrie examples declared in our histories.
Howbeit where the rocks and quarrie grounds are, I take the swart of the
earth to be so thin, that no tree of anie greatnesse, other than shrubs
and bushes, is able to grow or prosper long therein for want of
sufficient moisture wherewith to feed them with fresh humour, or at the
leastwise of mould, to shrowd, staie vpright, and cherish the same in
the blustering winters weather, till they may grow vnto anie greatnesse,
and spread or yéeld their rootes downe right into the soile about them:
and this either is or may be one other cause, wherefore some places are
naturallie void of wood. But to procéed. Although I must needs confesse
that there is good store of great wood or timber here and there, euen
now in some places of England, yet in our daies it is far vnlike to that
plentie, which our ancestors haue séene heretofore, when statelie
building was lesse in vse. For albeit that there were then greater
number of mesuages and mansions almost in euerie place; yet were their
frames so slight and slender, that one meane dwelling house in our time
is able to counteruaile verie manie of them, if you consider the present
charge with the plentie of timber that we bestow vpon them. In times
past men were contented to dwell in houses, builded of sallow, willow,
plumtree, hardbeame, and elme, so that the vse of oke was in maner
dedicated wholie vnto churches, religious houses, princes palaces,
noblemens lodgings, &amp; nauigation: but now all these are reiected, and
<span class="leftnote">Desire of much wealth and ease abateth manhood,
&amp; ouerthroweth a manlie courage.</span>
nothing but oke anie whit regarded. And yet sée the change, for when our
houses were builded of willow, then had we oken men; but now that our
houses are come to be made of oke, our men are not onlie become willow,
but a great manie through Persian delicacie crept in among vs altogither
of straw, which is a sore alteration. In those the courage of the owner
was a sufficient defense to kéepe the house in safetie, but now the
assurance of the timber, double doores, lockes and bolts must defend the
man from robbing. Now haue we manie chimnies and yet our tenderlings
complaine of rheumes, catarhs and poses. Then had we none but
reredosses, and our heads did neuer ake. For as the smoke in those daies
was supposed to be a sufficient hardning for the timber of the house; so
it was reputed a far better medicine to kéepe the good man and his
familie from the quacke or pose, wherewith as then verie few were oft
acquainted.</p>

<p>Of the curiousnesse of these piles I speake not, sith our workemen are
growne generallie to such an excellencie of deuise in the frames now
made, that they farre passe the finest of the old. And such is their
husbandrie in dealing with their timber, that the same stuffe which in
time past was reiected as crooked, vnprofitable, and to no vse but the
fire, dooth now come in the fronts and best part of the worke. Wherby
the common saieng is likewise in these daies verified in our mansion
houses, which earst was said onelie of the timber for ships, that no oke
can grow so crooked but it falleth out to some vse, &amp; that necessarie in
the nauie. It is a world to sée moreouer how diuerse men being bent to
building, and hauing a delectable veine in spending of their goods by
that trade, doo dailie imagine new deuises of their owne to guide their
workemen withall, and those more curious and excellent alwaies than the
former. In the procéeding also of their workes, how they set vp, how
they pull downe, how they inlarge, how they restreine, how they ad to,
how they take from, whereby their heads are neuer idle, their purses
neuer shut, nor their bookes of account neuer made perfect.</p>

<p class="ind1">"Destruunt, ædificant, mutant quadrata rotundis"</p>

<p>saith the poet. So that if a man should well consider of all the od
crotchets in such a builders braine, he would thinke his head to haue
euen inough of those affaires onelie, &amp; therefore iudge that he should
not well be able to deale in anie other. But such commonlie are our
<span class="page"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>[Page 357]</span>
workemasters, that they haue beside this veine afore mentioned, either
great charge of merchandizes, little lesse businesse in the
commonwealth, or finallie no small dealings otherwise incident vnto
them, wherby gaine ariseth, and some trouble oft among withall. Which
causeth me to wonder not a little how they can plaie the parts so well
of so manie sundrie men, whereas diuerse other of greater forecast in
apparance can seldome shift well or thriue in anie one of them. But to
our purpose.</p>

<p>We haue manie woods, forrests, and parks, which cherish trées
abundantlie, although in the woodland countries there is almost no hedge
that hath not some store of the greatest sort, beside infinit numbers of
hedgerowes, groues, and springs, that are mainteined of purpose for the
building and prouision of such owners as doo possesse the same. Howbeit
as euerie soile dooth not beare all kinds of wood, so there is not anie
wood, parke, hedgerow, groue, or forrest, that is not mixed with
diuerse, as oke, ash, hasell, hawthorne, birch, béech, hardbeame, hull,
sorfe, quicken aspe, poplers, wild cherie, and such like, wherof oke
hath alwaies the preheminence, as most méet for building and the nauie,
whervnto it is reserued. This tree bringeth foorth also a profitable
kind of mast, whereby such as dwell néere vnto the aforesaid places doo
cherish and bring vp innumerable heards of swine. In time of plentie of
this mast, our red and fallow déere will not let to participat thereof
with our hogs, more than our nete: yea our common pultrie also if they
may come vnto them. But as this abundance dooth prooue verie pernicious
<span class="leftnote">The like haue I séene where hens doo féed
vpon the tender blades of garlike.</span>
vnto the first, so these egs which these latter doo bring foorth (beside
blackenesse in color and bitternesse of tast) haue not seldome beene
found to bréed diuerse diseases vnto such persons as haue eaten of the
same. I might ad in like sort the profit insuing by the barke of this
wood, whereof our tanners haue great vse in dressing of leather, and
which they buie yearelie in Maie by the fadame, as I haue oft séene: but
it shall not néed at this time to enter into anie such discourse, onlie
this I wish, that our sole and vpper leathering may haue their due time,
and not be hasted on by extraordinarie slights, as with ash, barke, &amp;c.
Whereby as I grant that it séemeth outwardlie to be verie thicke &amp; well
doone: so if you respect the sadnes thereof, it dooth prooue in the end
to be verie hollow &amp; not able to hold out water. Neuerthelesse we haue
good lawes for redresse of this enormitie, but it c&#333;meth to passe in
these as in the execution of most penall statutes. For the gaines to be
gotten by the same being giuen to one or two hungrie and vnthriftie
persons, they make a shew of great reformation at the first, &amp; for a
litle while, till they find that following of sute in law against the
offendors is somwhat too chargeable and tedious. This therefore
perceiued, they giue ouer the law, and fall to the admission of gifts
and rewards to winke at things past, and when they haue once gone ouer
their ground with this kind of tillage, then doo they tender licences,
and offer large dispensations vnto him that shall aske the same, thereby
to doo what him listeth in his trade for an yearelie pension, whereby
the bribour now groweth to some certeine reuenues, &amp; the tanner to so
great libertie that his lether is much worse than before. But is not
this a mockerie of our lawes, &amp; manifest illusion of the good subiect
whom they thus pill &amp; poll? Of all oke growing in England the parke oke
is the softest, and far more spalt and brickle than the hedge oke. And
of all in Essex, that growing in Bardfield parke is the finest for
ioiners craft: for oftentimes haue I seene of their workes made of that
oke so fine and faire, as most of the wainescot that is brought hither
out of Danske, for our wainescot is not made in England. Yet diuerse
haue assaied to deale without okes to that end, but not with so good
successe as they haue hoped, bicause the ab or iuice will not so soone
be remoued and cleane drawne out, which some attribute to want of time
in the salt water. Neuerthelesse in building, so well the hedge as the
parke oke go all one waie, and neuer so much hath beene spent in a
hundred years before, as is in ten yeare of our time; for euerie man
almost is a builder, and he that hath bought any small parcell of
ground, be it neuer so little, will not be quiet till he haue pulled
downe the old house (if anie were there standing) and set vp a new after
his owne deuise. But wherevnto will this curiositie come?</p>

<p>Of elme we haue great store in euerie high waie and elsewhere, yet haue
<span class="page"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[Page 358]</span>
I not séene thereof anie togither in woods or forrests, but where they
haue béene first planted and then suffered to spread at their owne
willes. Yet haue I knowen great woods of béech and hasell in manie
places, especiallie in Barkeshire, Oxfordshire, and Buckinghamshire,
where they are greatlie cherished, &amp; conuerted to sundrie vses by such
as dwell about them. Of all the elms that euer I saw, those in the south
side of Douer court, in Essex néere Harwich are the most notable, for
they grow (I meane) in crooked maner, that they are almost apt for
nothing else but nauie timber, great ordinance, and béetels: and such
thereto is their naturall qualitie, that being vsed in the said behalfe,
they continue longer, and more long than anie the like trées in
whatsoeuer parcell else of this land, without <ins title="Transcriber's Note: possibly from 'ceorfan', to cut, cut down">cuphar</ins>, shaking, or
cleauing, as I find.</p>

<p>Ash commeth vp euerie where of it selfe, and with euerie kind of wood.
And as we haue verie great plentie and no lesse vse of these in our
husbandrie, so are we not without the plane, the vgh, the sorfe, the
chestnut, the line, the blacke cherrie, and such like. And although that
we inioy them not in so great plentie now in most places, as in times
past, or the other afore remembred: yet haue we sufficient of them all
for our necessarie turnes and vses, especiallie of vgh; as may be séene
betwixt Rotheram and Sheffield, and some stéeds of Kent also, as I haue
béene informed.</p>

<p>The firre, frankincense, and pine, we doo not altogither want,
especiallie the firre, whereof we haue some store in Chatleie moore in
Darbishire, Shropshire, Andernesse, and a mosse néere Manchester, not
far from Leircesters house: although that in time past not onelie all
Lancastershire, but a great part of the coast betwéene Chester and the
Solme were well stored. As for the frankincense and pine, they haue
béene planted onelie in colleges and cloisters, by the cleargie and
religious heretofore. Wherefore (in mine opinion) we may rather saie
that we want them altogither: for except they grew naturallie, and not
by force, I sée no cause whie they should be accounted for parcell of
our commodities. We haue also the aspe, whereof our fletchers make their
arrowes. The seuerall kinds of poplars of our turners haue great vse for
bolles, treies, troughs, dishes, &amp;c. Also the alder, whose barke is not
vnprofitable to die blacke withall, and therfore much vsed by our
countrie wiues in colouring their knit hosen. I might here take occasion
to speake of the great sales yéerelie made of wood, whereby an infinit
quantitie hath bin destroied within these few yéers: but I giue ouer to
trauell in this behalfe. Howbeit thus much I dare affirme, that if woods
go so fast to decaie in the next hundred yeere of Grace, as they haue
doone and are like to doo in this, sometimes for increase of sheepwalks,
and some maintenance of prodigalitie and pompe (for I haue knowne a well
<span class="rightnote">* This gentleman caught such an heate with this sore
loade that he was faine to go to Rome for physicke, yet it
could not saue his life, but hée must néeds die homewards.</span>
burnished gentleman * that hath borne threescore at once in one paire
of galigascons to shew his strength and brauerie) it is to be feared
that the fennie bote, broome, turffe, gall, heath, firze, brakes,
whinnes, ling, dies, hassacks, flags, straw, sedge, réed, rush, and also
seacole will be good merchandize euen in the citie of London, wherevnto
some of them euen now haue gotten readie passage, and taken vp their
innes in the greatest merchants parlours. A man would thinke that our
laws were able inough to make sufficient prouision for the redresse of
this error &amp; enormitie likelie to insue. But such is the nature of our
countriemen, that as manie laws are made, so they will kéepe none; or if
they be vrged to make answer, they will rather séeke some crooked
construction of them to the increase of their priuat gaine, than yéeld
themselues to be guided by the same for a commonwealth and profit to
their countrie. So that in the end whatsoeuer the law saith we will haue
our willes, whereby the wholesome ordinances of the prince are
contemned, the trauell of the nobilitie &amp; councellors as it were
derided, the common wealth impouerished, &amp; a few onelie inriched by this
peruerse dealing. Thus manie thousand persons doo suffer hinderance by
this their lewd behauiour. Hereby the wholesome laws of the prince are
oft defrauded, and the good meaning magistrate in consultation about the
common wealth vtterlie neglected. I would wish that I might liue no
longer than to sée foure things in this land reformed, that is: the want
of discipline in the church: the couetous dealing of most of our
merchants in the preferment of the commodities of other countries, and
<span class="page"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>[Page 359]</span>
hinderance of their owne: the holding of faires and markets vpon the
sundaie to be abolished and referred to the wednesdaies: and that euerie
man, in whatsoeuer part of the champaine soile enioieth fortie acres of
land, and vpwards, after that rate, either by frée deed, copie hold, or
fee farme, might plant one acre of wood, or sowe the same with oke mast,
hasell, béech, and sufficient prouision be made that it may be cherished
and kept. But I feare me that I should then liue too long, and so long,
that I should either be wearie of the world, or the world of me; and yet
they are not such things but they may easilie be brought to passe.</p>
<p>
Certes euerie small occasion in my time is enough to cut downe a great
wood, and euerie trifle sufficeth to laie infinit acres of corne ground
vnto pasture. As for the taking downe of houses, a small fine will beare
out a great manie. Would to God we might once take example of the
Romans, who in restreint of superfluous grasing, made an exact
limitation, how manie head of cattell ech estate might kéepe, and what
numbers of acres should suffice for that and other purposes. Neither was
wood euer better cherished or mansion houses mainteined, than by their
lawes and statutes. Such also was their care in the maintenance of
nauigation, that it was a great part of the charge of their consuls,
yéerelie to view and looke vnto the hilles whereon great timber did
grow, least their vnnecessarie faults for the satisfaction of the priuat
owner, and his couetous mind might prooue a preiudice vnto the common
wealth, in the hinderance of sufficient stuffe for the furniture of
their nauie. Certes the like hereof is yet obserued in Venice. Read also
I praie you what Suetonius writeth of the consulship of Bibulus and
Cesar. As for the wood that Ancus Martius dedicated toward the
maintenance of the common nauie, I passe it ouer, as hauing elsewhere
remembred it vnto another end. But what doo I meane to speake of these,
sith my purpose is onlie to talke of our owne woods? Well, take this
then for a finall conclusion in woods, that beside some countries are
alreadie driuen to sell their wood by the pound, which is an heauie
report: within these fortie yéeres we shall haue little great timber
growing aboue fortie yéeres old; for it is commonlie séene that those
yoong staddles which we leaue standing at one &amp; twentie yéeres fall, are
vsuallie at the next sale cut downe without any danger of the statute,
and serue for fire bote, if it please the owner to burne them.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Marises and fennes.</span>
Marises and fennie bogges we haue manie in England, though not now so
many as some of the old Roman writers doo specifie, but more in Wales,
if you haue respect vnto the seuerall quantities of the countries.
Howbeit as they are verie profitable in the summer halfe of the yeere,
so are a number of them which lie lowe and néere to great riuers, to
small commoditie in the winter part, as common experience dooth teach.
Yet this I find of manie moores, that in times past they haue béene
harder ground, and sundrie of them well replenished with great woods,
that now are void of bushes. And for example hereof, we may sée the
triall (beside the roots that are dailie found in the déeps of Monmouth,
where turfe is digged, also in Wales, Aburgauennie, and Merioneth) in
sundrie parts of Lancashire, where great store of firre hath growen in
times past, as I said, and the people go vnto this daie into their fens
and marises with long spits, which they dash here and there vp to the
verie cronge into the ground. In which practise, (a thing commonlie
doone in winter) if they happen to smite vpon anie firre trées which lie
there at their whole lengths, or other blocks, they note the place, and
about haruest time, when the ground is at the driest, they come againe
and get them vp, and afterward carieng them home, applie them to their
vses. The like doo they in Shropshire with the like, which hath beene
felled in old time, within 7 miles of Salop. Some of them foolishlie
suppose the same to haue lien there since Noies floud: and other more
fond than the rest, imagine them to grow euen in the places where they
find them, without all consideration that in times past, the most part,
if not all Lhoegres and Cambria was generallie replenished with wood,
which being felled or ouerthrowne vpon sundrie occasions, was left lieng
in some places still on the ground, and in processe of time became to be
quite ouergrowne with earth and moulds, which moulds wanting their due
sadnesse, are now turned into moorie plots. Wherby it commeth to passe
also, that great plentie of water commeth betwéene the new loose swart
and the old hard earth, that being drawen awaie by ditching and draines
<span class="page"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[Page 360]</span>
(a thing soone doone if our countrie-men were painfull in that behalfe)
might soone leaue a drie soile to the great lucre and aduantage of the
owner. We find in our histories, that Lincolne was somtime builded by
Lud brother to Cassibelan, who called it Cair Ludcoit, of the great
store of woods that inuironed the same: but now the commoditie is
vtterlie decaied there, so that if Lud were aliue againe, he would not
call it his citie in the wood, but rather his towne in the plaines: for
the wood (as I heare) is wasted altogither about the same. The hilles
called the Peke were in like sort named Mennith and Orcoit, that is, the
wooddie hilles and forrests. But how much wood is now to be séene in
those places, let him that hath béene there testifie, if he list; for I
heare of no such store there as hath béene in time past by those that
trauell that waie. And thus much of woods and marises, and so far as I
can deale with the same.</p>

<small>OF BATHS AND HOT WELLES.</small><br />

CHAP. XXIII.</h3>

<p>As almightie GOD hath in most plentifull maner bestowed infinit, and
those verie notable benefits vpon this Ile of Britaine, whereby it is
not a little inriched: so in hot and naturall baths (whereof we haue
diuerse in sundrie places) it manifestlie appéereth that he hath not
forgotten England. There are sundrie baths therefore to be found in this
realme, of which the first is called saint Vincents, the second
Halliewell; both being places (in my opinion) more obscure than the
other two, and yet not seldome sought vnto by such as stand in need. For
albeit the fame of their forces be not so generallie spread, yet in some
cases they are thought to be nothing inferior to the other, as diuerse
haue often affirmed by their owne experience and triall. The third place
wherein hot baths are to be found is néere vnto Buxston, a towne in
Darbishire, situat in the high Peke, not passing sixtéene miles from
Manchester, or Markechesterford, and twentie from Darbie, where, about
eight or nine seuerall welles are to be séene; of which thrée are
counted to be most excellent: but of all, the greatest is the hotest,
void of corruption, and compared (as Iones saith) with those of
Summersetshire, so cold indéed, as a quart of boiling water would be
made if fiue quartes of running water were added therevnto; whereas on
the other side, those of Bath likened vnto these, haue such heat
appropriated vnto them, as a gallon of hot water hath when a quart of
cold is mixed with the same. Herevpon the effect of this bath worketh
more temperatlie and pleasantlie (as he writeth) than the other. And
albeit that it maketh not so great spéed in cure of such as resort vnto
it for helpe: yet it dealeth more effectuallie and commodiouslie than
those in Summersetshire, and infer with all lesse greeuous accidents in
the restreining of naturall issues, strengthening the affeebled members,
assisting the liuelie forces, dispersing annoious oppilations, and
qualifieng of sundrie griefes, as his experience hath oft confirmed. The
like vertues haue the other two, but not in such measure: and therefore
their operation is not so speedilie perceiued. The fourth place where
baths are, is kings Newnam, and within certeine miles of Couentrie, the
water wherof (as it is thought) procéedeth from some rocke of allume,
and this I vnderstand by diuerse glouers which haue béene there, and
also by mine owne experience, that it hath a tast much like to allume
liquor, and yet nothing vnplesant nor vnsauorie in the drinking. There
are thrée welles in all, but the chiefest and best of them riseth out of
an hill, and runneth toward the south, &amp; from thence infinit plentie of
water without anie notable diminution of the spring is dailie caried
into sundrie parties of the realme, &amp; droonke by such as haue néed to
occupie the same. Of the other two, one is reserued for such as be
comelie personages and void of lothsome diseases: the other is left
common for tag and rag; but clensed dailie as the other is, whereby it
becommeth the wholesomer. Manie diseases also are cured in the same, as
the palsie, dimnesse of sight, dulnesse of hearing, but especiallie the
collike and the stone, old sores and gréene wounds; so that I suppose
<span class="page"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>[Page 361]</span>
there was neuer anie compound medicine of greater and more spéedie force
in these behalfes, than the vse of this simple liquor is to such as doo
frequent it. The said water hath a naturall propertie also following it
which is rare, for if a leafe, or sticke of ash, oke, &amp;c: doo fall into
the same, within a short space, such store of fine sand (comming no
doubt out of the earth with the water) will congeale and gather about
it, that the forme being reserued, and the inner part not lightlie
altered, it will seeme to become an hard stone, and much like vnto that
which is ingendred in the kidneis of a man, as I haue séene by
experience. At the first entrance it is verie cold, but after a season
it warmeth the goer in, casting him into an indifferent heat. And this
is furthermore remembred of it, that no man hath yet susteined anie
manner of impeachment through the coldnesse of the same. The vertue
thereof was found 1579 about Whitsuntide, by a man who had wounded
himselfe, &amp; comming by the same water, thought onelie to wash the blood
from his hand therewith, and so to go home and séeke for helpe by
surgerie: finallie finding the paine well asswaged, &amp; the wound faire
clensed, he departed, and misliking his vsuall medicins, he eftsoones
came againe, and so often indéed vnto the said water till his hand was
healed outright without anie other practise. By this meanes also he
became a counsellor to other being hurt or in paine, that they should
trie the vertue of this spring, who finding ease also, gaue out such
commendation of the said water, that now at this present their fame is
fullie equall, and the resort vnto them nothing inferior to that of the
old baths. Beside this, the cures of such diseases as their forces do
extend vnto, is much more speedie than we may haue at the other; and
this is one commoditie also not smallie to be considered of. The fift
place of baths or medicinable welles is at an hamlet called Newton, a
little from saint Neots, or (as we pronounce it) saint Needs, which is
ten or twelue miles from Cambridge, where two springs are knowne to be,
of which the one is verie sweet and fresh, the other brackish &amp; salt;
this is good for scabs and leaperie (as it is said) the other for
dimnesse of sight. Verie manie also doo make their repaire vnto them for
sundrie diseases, some returning whole, and some nothing at all amended,
bicause their cure is without the reach and working of those waters.
Neuer went people so fast from the church, either vnto a faire or
market, as they go to these wels, and those neere Rugbie, both places
being discouered in this 1579 of Grace. I heare of another well to be
found also about Ratcliffe néere London, euen at the same season. But
sith rumors are now spred almost of euerie spring, &amp; vaine tales flie
about in maner of euerie water, I surcease to speake at all of anie
other, till further experience doo trie whether they be medicinable or
not: and yet I doubt not but most of these alredie mentioned haue
heretofore bin knowne &amp; remembred also, though confusedlie by the
writers of old time; &amp; yet in processe of time either neglected or
forgotten, by meanes of sundrie troubles and turmoiles made in this
realme by Danes, and other outward enimies, whereby their manifold
benefit hath woonderfullie béene missed.</p>

<p>The last place of our baths, is a citie in Summersetshire, which taketh
his name of the hot waters there to be séene and vsed. At the first it
was called Cair Bledud, and not Cair Bledune, as some would haue it, for
that is the old name of the ancient castell at Malmesburie, which the
Saxons named Yngleburne. Ptolomie afterward called it Thermæ, other Aquæ
solis, or Scamannia, or Acmancester, but now it hight generallie Bath in
English, and vnder that name it is likelie to continue. The citie of it
selfe is a verie ancient thing, no doubt, as may yet appeare by diuerse
notable antiquities ingraued in stone, to be séene in the wals thereof;
and first of all betweene the south gate and the west, and betwixt the
west gate and the north.</p>

<p>The first is the antike head of a man, made all flat, with great locks
of haire, much like to the coine that I haue seene of Antius the Romane.
The second betweene the south and the north gate is an image, as I take
it, of Hercules, for he held in each hand a serpent, and so dooth this.
Thirdlie there standeth a man on foot with a sword in his one hand, and
a buckler stretched out in the other. There is also a branch that lieth
folded and wreathed into circles, like to the wreath of Alcimedon. There
<span class="page"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[Page 362]</span>
are moreouer two naked images, whereof the one imbraceth the other,
beside sundrie antike heads, with ruffled haire, a greiehound running,
and at his taile certeine Romane letters, but so defaced that no man
liuing can read them at this present. There is moreouer the image of
Lacaon, inuironed with two serpents, and an other inscription, and all
these betwéene the south and the west gates, as I haue said before.</p>

<p>Now, betweene the west and north gate are two inscriptions, of which
some words are euident to be read, the residue are cleane defaced. There
is also the image of a naked man, and a stone in like sort, which hath
"Cupidines &amp; labruscas intercurrentes," and a table hauing at each hand
an image vined and finelie florished both aboue and beneath. Finallie
(sauing that I saw afterward the image of a naked man grasping a serpent
in each hand) there was an inscription of a toome or buriall, wherein
these words did plainelie appeare, "Vixit annos xxx" but so defusedlie
written, that letters stood for whole words, and two or thrée letters
combined into one. Certes I will not saie whether these were set into
the places where they now stand by the gentiles, or brought thither from
other ruines of the towne it selfe, and placed afterward in those wals,
in their necessarie reparations. But howsoeuer the matter standeth, this
is to be gathered by our histories, that Bladud first builded that citie
there, and peraduenture might also kindle the sulphurous veines, of
purpose to burne continuallie there in the honour of Minerua: by which
occasion the springs thereabout did in processe of time become hot &amp; not
vnprofitable, for sundrie kinds of diseases. Indeed the later Pagans
dreamed, that Minerua was the chéefe goddesse and gouernesse of these
<span class="leftnote">Chap. 25.</span>
waters, bicause of the néerenesse of hir temple vnto the same. Solinus
addeth furthermore, how that in hir said temple, the fire which was
continuallie kept, did neuer consume into dead sparkles; but so soone as
the embers thereof were cold, they congealed into clots of hard stone:
all which I take to be nothing else than the effect of the aforesaid
fire, of the sulphurous veine kindled in the earth, from whence the
waters doo come. That these baths or waters are deriued from such, the
<span class="leftnote">The Pyritis is found almost in euerie veine of mettall
in great plentie, diuersities and colour, and somtimes mixed
with that mettall of whose excrements it consisteth.</span>
marchasites, which the Grecians call Pyritis, per antonomasiam (for
being smit with the iron, it yéeldeth more sparkes than anie flint or
calcedonie, and therefore seemeth to deserue the name aboue the rest)
and besides these other stones mixed with some copper, and dailie found
vpon the mounteins thereabouts will beare sufficient witnesse, though I
would write the contrarie. Doctor Turner also the father of English
physicke, and an excellent diuine, supposeth that these springs doo draw
their forces from sulphur: or if there be anie other thing mingled
withall, he gesseth that it should be salt peter, bicause he found an
obscure likelihood of the same, euen in the crosse bath. But that they
participate with anie allume at all, he could neuer till his dieng daie
be induced to beléeue. I might here (if I thought it necessarie) intreat
of the notable situation of the citie, which standeth in a pleasant
bottome, inuironed on euerie side with great hils, out of the which come
so manie springs of pure water by sundrie waies vnto the citie, and in
such abundance, as that euerie house is serued with the same by pipes of
lead, the said mettall being the more plentious and lesse of value vnto
them, bicause it is not had far off from those quarters. It should not
be amisse also to speake of the foure gates, number of parish churches,
bridges, religious houses dissolued, and their founders, if place did
serue therefore: but for so much as my purpose is not to deale in this
behalfe, I will omit the mention of these things, and go in hand with
the baths themselues, wherof in the title of this chapiter I protested
to intreat.</p>

<p>There are two springs of water (as Leland saith) in the west south west
<span class="leftnote">Crosse bath.</span>
part of the towne, whereof the biggest is called the crosse bath, of a
certeine crosse that was erected sometime in the middest thereof. This
bath is much frequented by such as are diseased with leaprie, pockes,
scabs, and great aches: yet of it selfe it is verie temperate and
pleasant, hauing eleuen or twelue arches of stone in the sides thereof,
for men to stand vnder, when raine dooth ought annoie them.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Common bath.</span>
The common bath, or as some call it, the hot bath, is two hundred foot,
or thereabout from the crosse bath, lesse in compasse within the wall
than the other, and with onelie seauen arches, wrought out of the maine
<span class="page"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>[Page 363]</span>
inclosure. It is worthilie called the hot bath, for at the first comming
into it, men thinke that it would scald their flesh, and lose it from
the bone: but after a season, and that the bodies of the commers thereto
be warmed throughlie in the same, it is more tollerable and easie to be
borne. Both these baths be in the middle of a little stréet, and ioine
to S. Thomas hospitall, so that it may be thought that Reginald bishop
of Bath made his house néere vnto these common baths, onelie to succour
such poore people as should resort vnto them.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Kings bath.</span>
The kings bath is verie faire and large, standing almost in the middle
of the towne, at the west end of the cathedrall church. It is compassed
about with a verie high stone wall, and the brims thereof are mured
round about, where in be two and thirtie arches for men and women to
stand in separatlie, who being of the gentrie for the most part, doo
<span class="leftnote">Hot houses in some countries little better than brodels.</span>
resort thither indifferentlie, but not in such lasciuious sort as vnto
other baths and hot houses of the maine, whereof some write more a great
deale than modestie should reueale, and honestie performe. There went a
sluce out of this bath, which serued in times past the priorie with
water, which was deriued out of it vnto two places, and commonlie vsed
for baths, but now I doo not thinke that they remaine in vsage.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Colour of the water of the baths.</span>
As for the colour of the water of all the bathes, it is most like to a
déepe blew, and reeketh much after the maner of a seething pot,
<span class="rightnote">Taste of the water.</span>
commonlie yéelding somwhat a sulpherous taste, and verie vnpleasant
sauour. The water also that runneth from the two small baths, goeth by a
dyke into the Auon by west, and beneath the bridge: but the same that
goeth from the kings bath turneth a mill, and after goeth into Auon
aboue Bath bridge, where it loseth both force and tast, and is like vnto
the rest. In all the three baths a man maie euidentlie see how the water
<span class="leftnote">Fall or issue of the water.</span>
bubbleth vp from the springs. This is also to be noted, that at certeine
times all entrances into them is vtterlie prohibited, that is to saie,
at high noone, and midnight: for at those two seasons, and a while
before and after, they boile verie feruentlie, and become so hot that no
man is able to indure their heat, or anie while susteine their force and
vehement working. They purge themselues furthermore from all such filth
as the diseased doo leaue in each of them, wherfore we doo forbeare the
rash entrance into them at that time: and so much the rather, for that
we would not by contraction of anie new diseases, depart more
gréeuouslie affected than we came vnto the citie, which is in déed a
<span class="leftnote">Not good to enter into baths at all seasons.</span>
thing that each one should regard. For these causes therefore they are
commonlie shut vp from halfe an houre after ten of the clocke in the
forenoone, to halfe an houre after one in the afternoone, and likewise
at midnight: at which times the kéeper of them resorteth to his charge,
openeth the gates, and leaueth (or should leaue) frée passage vnto such
as come vnto them. Hitherto Leland.</p>

<p>What cost of late hath béene bestowed vpon these baths by diuerse of the
nobilitie, gentrie, communaltie, and cleargie, it lieth not in me to
declare: yet as I heare, they are not onelie verie much repared and
garnished with sundrie curious péeces of workemanship, partlie touching
their commendation, and partlie for the ease and benefit of such as
resort vnto them; but also better ordered, clenlier kept, &amp; more
friendlie prouision made for such pouertie as dailie repaireth thither.
But notwithstanding all this, such is the generall estate of things in
Bath, that the rich men maie spend while they will, and the poore beg
whilest they list for their maintenance and diet so long as they remaine
there: and yet I denie not but that there is verie good order in that
citie for all degrées. But where shall a man find anie equall regard of
poore and rich, though God dooth giue these his good gifts fréelie, &amp;
vnto both alike? I would here intreat further of the customs vsed in
these baths, what number of physicians dailie attend vpon those waters,
for no man (especiallie such as be able to interteine them) dooth enter
into these baths before he consult with the physician; also, what diet
is to be obserued, what particular diseases are healed there, and to
what end the commers thither doo drinke oftimes of that medicinable
liquor: but then I should excéed the limits of a description. Wherefore
I passe it ouer to others, hoping that some man yer long will vouchsafe
to performe that at large, which the famous clearke Doctor Turner hath
<span class="page"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>[Page 364]</span>
brieflie yet happilie begun, touching the effects &amp; working of the same.
For hitherto I doo not know of manie that haue trauelled in the natures
of those baths of our countrie, with anie great commendation; much lesse
of anie that hath reuealed them at the full for the benefit of our
nation, or commoditie of strangers that resort vnto the same.</p>

<small>OF ANTIQUITIES FOUND.</small><br />

CHAP. XXIV.</h3>

<p>Hauing taken some occasion to speake here and there in this treatise of
antiquities, it shall not be amis to deale yet more in this chapter,
with some of them apart, &amp; by themselues, whereby the secure authoritie
of the Romans ouer this Iland maie in some cases more manifestlie
appeare. For such was their possession of this Iland on this side of the
Tine, that they held not one or two, or a few places onelie vnder their
subiection, but all the whole countrie from east to west, from the Tine
to the British sea, so that there was no region void of their
gouernance: notwithstanding that vntill the death of Lucius, and
extinction of his issue, they did permit the successors of Lud and
Cimbaline to reigne and rule amongest them, though vnder a certeine
tribute, as else-where I haue declared. The chéefe cause that vrgeth me
to speake of antiquities, is the paines that I haue taken to gather
great numbers of them togither, intending (if euer my Chronologie shall
happen to come abroad) to set downe the liuelie portraitures of euerie
emperour ingrauen in the same: also the faces of Pompeie, Crassus, the
seuen kings of the Romans, Cicero, and diuerse other, which I haue
prouided readie for the purpose, beside the monuments and liuelie images
of sundrie philosophers, and kings of this Iland, since the time of
Edward the Confessor. Wherof although presentlie I want a few, yet I doo
not doubt but to obteine them all, if friendship at the leastwise
procured for monie shall be able to preuaile. But as it hath doone
hitherto, so the charges to be emploied vpon these brasen or copper
images, will hereafter put by the impression of that treatise: whereby
it maie come to passe, that long trauell shall soone proue to be spent
in vaine, and much cost come to verie small successe. Whereof yet I
force not greatlie, sith by this means I haue reaped some commoditie
vnto my selfe, by searching of the histories, which often minister store
of examples readie to be vsed in my function, as occasion shall mooue
me. But to procéed with my purpose.</p>

<p>Before the comming of the Romans, there was a kind of copper monie
currant here in Britaine, as Cæsar confesseth in the fift booke of his
Commentaries, but I find not of what maner it was. Hereto he addeth a
report of certeine rings, of a proportionate weight, which they vsed in
his time, in stead likewise of monie. But as hitherto it hath not bene
my lucke (I saie) to haue the certeine view of anie of these, so after
the comming of the Romans, they inforced vs to abandon our owne, and
receiue such imperiall monies or coines, as for the paiment of their
legions was dailie brought ouer vnto them. What coines the Romans had,
it is easie to be knowne, and from time to time much of it is found in
manie places of this Iland, as well of gold and siluer, as of copper,
brasse, and other mettall, much like stéele, almost of euerie emperour.
So that I account it no rare thing to haue of the Roman coine, albeit
that it still represent an image of our captiuitie, and maie be a good
admonition for vs, to take heed how we yéeld our selues to the regiment
of strangers. Of the store of these monies, found vpon the Kentish
coast, I haue alreadie made mention in the description of Richborow, and
chapter of Iles adiacent vnto the British Albion, and there shewed also
how simple fishermen haue had plentie of them, and that the conies in
making profers and holes to bréed in, haue scraped them out of the
ground in verie great abundance. In speaking also of S. Albans, in the
chapter of townes and villages, I haue not omitted to tell what plentie
of these coines haue bene gathered there: wherfore I shall not néed here
to repeat the same againe. Howbeit this is certeine, that the most part
of all these antiquities, to be found within the land, &amp; distant from
<span class="page"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[Page 365]</span>
the shore, are to be gotten either in the ruines of ancient cities and
townes decaied, or in inclosed burrowes, where their legions accustomed
sometime to winter, as by experience is dailie confirmed. What store
hath béene séene of them in the citie of London, which they called
Augusta, of the legion that soiourned there, &amp; likewise in Yorke named
also Victrix, of the legion Victoria, or Altera Roma (because of the
beautie and fine building of the same) I my selfe can partlie witnesse,
that haue séene, &amp; often had of them, if better testimonie were wanting.
The like I maie affirme of Colchester, where those of Claudius, Adrian,
Traian, Vespasian, and other, are oftentimes plowed vp, or found by
other means: also of Cantorburie, Andredeschester (now decaied)
Rochester, then called Durobreuum, Winchester, and diuerse other beyond
the Thames, which for breuitie sake I doo passe ouer in silence. Onlie
the chiefe of all and where most are found in deed, is néere vnto
Carleon and Cairgwent in Southwales, about Kenchester, thrée miles aboue
Hereford, Aldborow, Ancaster, Bramdon, Dodington, where a spurre and
péece of a chaine of gold were found in king Henrie the eight his daies,
besides much of the said Roman coine, Binchester, Camalet, Lacocke vpon
Auon, and Lincolne, Dorchester, Warwike, and Chester, where they are
often had in verie great abundance. It seemeth that Ancaster hath beene
a great thing, for manie square &amp; colored pauements, vaults, and arches
are yet found, and often laid open by such as dig and plow in the fields
about the same. And amongst these, one Vresbie or Rosebie, a plowman,
did ere vp not long since a stone like a trough, couered with another
stone, wherein was great foison of the aforesaid coines. The like also
was séene not yet fortie yeares agone about Grantham. But in king Henrie
the eight his daies, an husbandman had far better lucke at Harleston,
two miles from the aforesaid place, where he found not onelie great
plentie of this coine, but also an huge brasse pot, and therein a large
helmet of pure gold, richlie fretted with pearle, and set with all kind
of costlie stones: he tooke vp also chaines much like vnto beads of
siluer, all which, as being (if a man might ghesse anie certeintie by
their beautie) not likelie to be long hidden, he presented to quéene
Katharine then lieng at Peterborow, and therewithall a few ancient
rolles of parchment written long agone, though so defaced with
mouldinesse, and rotten for age, that no man could well hold them in his
hand without falling into péeces, much lesse read them by reason of
their blindnesse.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the same kings daies also at Killeie a man found as
he eared, an arming girdle, harnessed with pure gold, and a great massie
pomell with a crosse hilt for a sword of the same mettall, beside studs
and harnesse for spurs, and the huge long spurs of like stuffe, whereof
one doctor Ruthall got a part into his hands. The boroughs or buries,
wherof I spake before, were certeine plots of ground, wherin the Romane
souldiers did vse to lie when they kept in the open fields as chosen
places, from whence they might haue easie accesse vnto their
aduersaries, if anie outrage were wrought or rebellion mooued against
them. And as these were the vsuall aboads for those able legions that
serued dailie in the wars, so had they other certeine habitations for
the old and forworne souldiers, whereby diuerse cities grew in time to
be replenished with Romane colonies, as Cairleon, Colchester, Chester,
and such other, of which, Colchester bare the name of Colonia long time,
and wherein A. Plautius builded a temple vnto the goddesse of Victorie
(after the departure of Claudius) which Tacitus calleth "Aram sempiternæ
dominationis," a perpetuall monument of that our British seruitude. But
to returne vnto our borowes, they were generallie walled about with
stone wals, and so large in compasse that some did conteine thirtie,
fourtie, three score, or eightie acres of ground within their limits:
they had also diuerse gates or ports vnto each of them, and of these not
a few remaine to be seene in our time, as one for example not far from
great Chesterford in Essex, néere to the limits of Cambridgshire, which
I haue often viewed, and wherein the compasse of the verie wall with the
places where the gates stood is easie to be discerned: the like also is
to be séene at a place within two miles south of Burton, called the
Borow hils. In these therefore and such like, and likewise at Euolsburg,
now S. Neots, or S. Needs, and sundrie other places, especiallie vpon
the shore and coasts of Kent, as Douer, Rie, Romneie, Lid, &amp;c: is much
<span class="page"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>[Page 366]</span>
of their coine also to be found, and some péeces or other are dailie
taken vp, which they call Borow pence, Dwarfs monie, Hegs pence, Feirie
groats, Jewes monie, &amp; by other foolish names not woorthie to be
remembred. At the comming of the Saxons, the Britons vsed these holds as
rescues for their cattell in the daie and night, when their enimies were
abroad; the like also did the Saxons against the Danes, by which
occasions (and now and then by carieng of their stones to helpe forward
other buildings néere at hand) manie of them were throwne downe and
defaced, which otherwise might haue continued for a longer time, and so
your honour would saie, if you should happen to peruse the thickenesse
and maner of building of those said wals and borowes. It is not long
since a siluer saucer of verie ancient making was found néere to Saffron
<span class="leftnote">Sterbirie a place where an armie hath lien.</span>
Walden, in the open field among the Sterbirie hils, and eared vp by a
plough, but of such massie greatnesse, that it weighed better than
twentie ounces, as I haue heard reported. But if I should stand in these
things vntill I had said all that might be spoken of them, both by
experience and testimonie of Leland in his Commentaries of Britaine, and
the report of diuerse yet liuing, I might make a greater chapter than
would be either conuenient or profitable to the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'aeader'">reader</ins>: wherefore so
much onelie shall serue the turne for this time as I haue said alreadie
of antiquities found within our Iland, especiallie of coine, whereof I

<small>OF THE COINES OF ENGLAND.</small><br />

CHAP. XXV.</h3>

<p>The Saxon coine before the conquest is in maner vtterlie vnknowne to me:
howbeit if my coniecture be anie thing, I suppose that one shilling of
siluer in those daies did counterpeise our common ounce, though
afterward it came to passe that it arose to twentie pence, and so
continued vntill the time of king Henrie the eight, who first brought it
to thrée shillings and foure pence, &amp; afterward our siluer coine vnto
<span class="leftnote">Copper monie.</span>
brasse &amp; copper monies, by reason of those inestimable charges, which
diuerse waies oppressed him. And as I gather such obscure notice of the
shilling which is called in Latine Solidus, so I read more manifestlie
of another which is the 48 part of a pound, and this also currant among
the Saxons of our Ile, so well in gold as in siluer, at such time as 240
of their penies made vp a iust pound, fiue pence went to the shilling,
and foure shillings to the ounce. But to procéed with my purpose. After
the death of K. Henrie, Edward his sonne began to restore the aforesaid
coine againe vnto fine siluer: so quéene Marie his successour did
continue his good purpose, notwithstanding that in hir time the Spanish
monie was verie c&#333;mon in England, by reason of hir mariage with
Philip king of Spaine.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Siluer restored.</span>
After hir decease the ladie Elizabeth hir sister, and now our most
gratious quéene, souereigne and princesse, did finish the matter wholie,
vtterly abolishing the vse of copper and brasen coine, and conuerting
the same into guns and great ordinance, she restored sundrie coines of
fine siluer, as péeces of halfepenie farding, of a penie, of three halfe
pence, péeces of two pence, of thrée pence, of foure pence (called the
groat) of six pence vsuallie named the testone, and shilling of twelue
pence, whereon she hath imprinted hir owne image, and emphaticall
<span class="leftnote">Old gold.</span>
superscription. Our gold is either old or new. The old is that which
hath remained since the time of king Edward the third, or béene coined
by such other princes as haue reigned since his deceasse, without anie
abasing or diminution of the finesse of that mettall. Therof also we
haue yet remaining, the riall, the George noble, the Henrie riall, the
salut, the angell, and their smaller peeces, as halfes or quarters,
though these in my time are not so common to be séene. I haue also
beheld the souereigne of twentie shillings, and the péece of thirtie
shillings, I haue heard likewise of péeces of fortie shillings, three
pounds, fiue pounds, and ten pounds. But sith there were few of them
coined, and those onelie at the commandement of kings, yearelie to
bestow where their maiesties thought good in lieu of new yeares gifts
<span class="page"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>[Page 367]</span>
and rewards: it is not requisit that I should remember them here amongst
our currant monies.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">New gold.</span>
The new gold is taken for such as began to be coined in the latter daies
of king Henrie the eight, at which time the finesse of the mettall began
to be verie much alaied, &amp; is not likelie to be restored for ought that
I can see: and yet is it such as hath béene coined since by his
successors princes of this realme, in value and goodnesse equall and not
inferiour to the coine and currant gold of other nations, where each one
dooth couet chiefelie to gather vp our old finer gold: so that the
angels, rials, and nobles, are more plentifullie seene in France,
Italie, and Flanders, than they be by a great deale within the realme of
England, if you regard the paiments which they dailie make in those
kinds of our coine. Our peeces now currant are of ten shillings, fiue
shillings, and two shillings and six pence onelie: and those of sundrie
stamps and names, as halfe souereigns (equall in weight with our currant
shilling, whereby that gold is valued at ten times so much siluer)
quarters of souereigns (otherwise called crownes) and halfe crownes:
likewise angels, halfe angels, and quarters of angels, or if there be
anie other, in good sooth I know them not, as one scarselie acquainted
with any siluer at all, much lesse then (God it wot) with any store of
gold.</p>

<p>The first currant shilling or siluer péeces of twelue pence stamped
within memorie, were coined by K. Henrie the eight in the twentith yeare
of his reigne, &amp; those of fiue shillings, and of two shillings and six
pence, &amp; the halfe shilling by king Edward the sixt: but the od péeces
aboue remembred vnder the groat by our high and mightie princesse quéene
Elizabeth, the name of the groat, penie, two pence, halfe penie, and
farding, in old time the greatest siluer monies if you respect their
denominations onelie, being more ancient than that I can well discusse
of the time of their beginnings. Yet thus much I read, that king Edward
the first in the eight yeare of his reigne, did first coine the penie
and smallest péeces of siluer roundwise, which before were square, and
woont to beare a double crosse with a crest, in such sort that the penie
might easilie be broken, either into halfes or quarters: by which shift
onelie the people came by small monies, as halfe pence and fardings,
that otherwise were not stamped nor coined of set purpose.</p>

<p>Of forren coines we haue all the ducats, the single, double, and the
double double, the crusadoes, with the long crosse and the short: the
portigue, a péece verie solemnelie kept of diuerse, &amp; yet oft times
abased with washing, or absolutelie counterfeited: and finallie the
French and Flemish crownes, onlie currant among vs, so long as they hold
weight. But of siluer coines, as the soules turnois, whereof ten make a
shilling, as the franke dooth two shillings, and thrée franks the French
crowne, &amp;c: we haue none at all: yet are the dalders, and such often
times brought ouer, but neuerthelesse exchanged as bullion, according to
their finenesse and weight, and afterward conuerted into coine, by such
as haue authoritie.</p>

<p>In old time we had sundrie mints in England, and those commonlie kept in
abbaies and religious houses before the conquest, where true dealing was
commonlie supposed most of all to dwell: as at Ramseie, S. Edmundsburie,
Canturburie, Glassenburie, Peterborow, and such like, sundrie
exemplificats of the grants whereof are yet to be seene in writing,
especiallie that of Peterborow vnder the confirmation of pope Eugenius:
wherevnto it appeereth further by a charter of king Edgar (which I haue)
that they either held it or had another in Stanford. But after the
Normans had once gotten the kingdome into their fingers, they trusted
themselues best with the ouersight of their mints, and therefore erected
diuerse of their owne, although they afterward permitted some for small
péeces of siluer vnto sundrie of the houses aforesaid. In my time
diuerse mints are suppressed, as Southwarke, Bristow, &amp;c: and all
coinage is brought into one place, that is to saie, the Tower of London,
where it is continuallie holden and perused, but not without great gaine
to such as deale withall. There is also coinage of tin holden yearelie
at two seuerall times, that is to saie, Midsummer and Michaelmas in the
west countrie; which at the first hearing I supposed to haue béene of
monie of the said mettall, and granted by priuilege from some prince
<span class="page"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[Page 368]</span>
vnto the towns of Hailestone, Trurie, and Lostwithiell. Howbeit, vpon
further examination of the matter, I find it to be nothing so, but an
office onlie erected for the prince, wherin he is allowed the ordinarie
customes of that mettall: and such blocks of tin as haue passed the
hands of his officers, are marked with an especiall stampe, whereby it
is knowne that the custome due for the same hath ordinarilie béene
answered. It should séeme (and in my opinion is verie likelie to be
true) that while the Romans reigned here, Kingstone vpon Thames
(sometime a right noble citie and place where the Saxon kings were
vsuallie crowned) was the chiefe place of their coinage for this
prouince. For in earing of the ground about that towne in times past,
and now of late (besides the curious foundation of manie goodlie
buildings that haue béene ripped vp by plowes, and diuerse coines of
brasse, siluer, and gold, with Romane letters in painted pots found
there) in the daies of cardinall Woolseie, one such huge pot was
discouered full as it were of new siluer latelie coined; another with
plates of siluer readie to be coined; and the third with chaines of
siluer and such broken stuffe redie (as it should appeere) to be melted
into coinage, whereof let this suffice to countenance out my coniecture.
Of coins currant before the comming of the Romans I haue elsewhere
declared, that there were none at all in Britaine: but as the Ilanders
of Scylira, the old Romans, Armenians, Scythians, Seritans, Sarmatians,
Indians, and Essences did barter ware for ware, so the Britons vsed
brasse or rings of iron, brought vnto a certeine proportion, in steed of
monie, as the Lacedemonians &amp; Bisantines also did, &amp; the Achiui (as
Homer writeth) who had (saith he) rough peeces of brasse and iron in
stéed of coine, wherewith they purchased their wines.</p>

<small>OF CATTELL KEPT FOR PROFIT.</small><br />

CHAP. I.</h3>

<p>There is no kind of tame cattell vsually to be séene in these parts of
the world, wherof we haue not some, and that great store in England; as
horsses, oxen, shéepe, goats, swine, and far surmounting the like in
other countries, as may be prooued with ease. For where are oxen
commonlie more large of bone, horsses more decent and pleasant in pase,
kine more commodious for the pale, shéepe more profitable for wooll,
swine more wholesome of flesh, and goates more gainefull to their
kéepers, than here with vs in England? But to speke of them peculiarlie,
I suppose that our kine are so abundant in yéeld of milke, wherof we
make our butter &amp; chéese, as the like anie where else, and so apt for
the plough in diuerse places as either our horsses or oxen. And albeit
they now and then twin, yet herein they séeme to come short of that
commoditie which is looked for in other countries, to wit, in that they
bring foorth most commonlie but one calfe at once. The gaines also
gotten by a cow (all charges borne) hath beene valued at twentie
shillings yearelie: but now as land is inhanced, this proportion of
gaine is much abated, and likelie to decaie more and more, if ground
arise to be yet déerer, which God forbid, if it be his will and
pleasure. I heard of late of a cow in Warwikshire, belonging to Thomas
Bruer of Studleie, which in six yéeres had sixtéene calfes, that is,
foure at once in thrée caluings and twise twins, which vnto manie may
<span class="leftnote">Oxen.</span>
séeme a thing incredible. In like maner our oxen are such as the like
are not to be found in anie countrie of Europe, both for greatnesse of
bodie and swéetnesse of flesh: or else would not the Romane writers haue
preferred them before those of Liguria. In most places our grasiers are
now growen to be so cunning, that if they doo but sée an ox or bullocke,
and come to the féeling of him, they will giue a ghesse at his weight,
and how manie score or stone of flesh and tallow he beareth, how the
butcher may liue by the sale, and what he may haue for the skin and
tallow; which is a point of skill not commonlie practised heretofore.
Some such grasiers also are reported to ride with veluet coats, and
<span class="page"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>[Page 370]</span>
chaines of gold about them: and in their absence their wiues will not
let to supplie those turnes with no lesse skill than their husbands:
which is an hard worke for the poore butcher, sith he through this means
can seldome be rich or wealthie by his trade. In like sort the flesh of
our oxen and kine is sold both by hand and by weight as the buier will:
but in yoong ware rather by weight, especiallie for the stéere and
heighfer, sith the finer béefe is the lightest, wheras the flesh of buls
and old kine, &amp;c: is of sadder substance and therefore much heauier as
it lieth in the scale. Their hornes also are knowne to be more faire and
large in England than in anie other places, except those which are to be
séene among the Pæones, which quantitie albeit that it be giuen to our
bréed generallie by nature, yet it is now and then helped also by art.
<span class="leftnote"><em>Athenæus bib. 10. cap. 8.</em></span>
For when they be verie yoong, manie grasiers will oftentimes annoint
their budding hornes, or tender tips with honie, which mollifieth the
naturall hardnesse of that substance, and thereby maketh them to grow
vnto a notable greatnesse. Certes, it is not strange in England, to sée
oxen whose hornes haue the length of a yard or thrée foot betweene the
tips, and they themselues thereto so tall, as the heigth of a man of
meane and indifferent stature is scarse equall vnto them. Neuerthelesse
it is much to be lamented that our generall bréed of cattell is not
better looked vnto: for the greatest occupiers weane least store,
bicause they can buie them (as they saie) far better cheape than to
raise and bring them vp. In my time a cow hath risen from foure nobles
to foure marks by this means, which notwithstanding were no great price
if they did yearelie bring foorth more than one calfe a péece, as I
heare they doo in other countries.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Horsses.</span>
Our horsses moreouer are high, and although not commonlie of such huge
greatnesse as in other places of the maine: yet if you respect the
easinesse of their pase, it is hard to saie where their like are to be
had. Our land dooth yéeld no asses, and therefore we want the generation
also of mules and somers; and therefore the most part of our cariage is
made by these, which remaining stoned, are either reserued for the cart,
or appointed to beare such burdens as are conuenient for them. Our cart
or plough horsses (for we vse them indifferentlie) are commonlie so
strong that fiue or six of them (at the most) will draw thrée thousand
weight of the greatest tale with ease for a long iourneie, although it
be not a load of common vsage, which consisteth onelie of two thousand,
or fiftie foot of timber, fortie bushels of white salt, or six and
thirtie of baie, or fiue quarters of wheat, experience dailie teacheth,
and I haue elsewhere remembred. Such as are kept also for burden, will
carie foure hundred weight commonlie, without anie hurt or hinderance.
This furthermore is to be noted, that our princes and the nobilitie haue
their cariage commonlie made by carts, wherby it commeth to passe, that
when the quéenes maiestie dooth remooue from anie one place to another,
there are vsuallie 400 carewares, which amount to the summe of 2400
horsses, appointed out of the countries adioining, whereby hir cariage
is conueied safelie vnto the appointed place. Hereby also the ancient
vse of somers and sumpter horsses is in maner vtterlie relinquished,
which causeth the traines of our princes in their progresses to shew far
lesse than those of the kings of other nations.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Geldings.</span>
Such as serue for the saddle are commonlie gelded, and now growne to be
verie déere among vs, especiallie if they be well coloured, iustlie
limmed, and haue thereto an easie ambling pase. For our countriemen,
séeking their ease in euerie corner where it is to be had, delight verie
much in these qualities, but chieflie in their excellent pases, which
besides that it is in maner peculiar vnto horsses of our soile, and not
hurtfull to the rider or owner sitting on their backes: it is moreouer
verie pleasant and delectable in his eares, in that the noise of their
well proportioned pase dooth yéeld comfortable sound as he trauelleth by
the waie. Yet is there no greater deceipt vsed anie where than among our
horssekeepers, horssecorsers, and hostelers: for such is the subtill
knauerie of a great sort of them (without exception of anie of them be
it spoken which deale for priuat gaine) that an honest meaning man shall
haue verie good lucke among them, if he be not deceiued by some false
tricke or other. There are certeine notable markets, wherein great
plentie of horsses and colts is bought and sold, and wherevnto such as
<span class="page"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>[Page 371]</span>
haue néed resort yearelie to buie and make their necessarie prouision of
them, as Rippon, Newport pond, Wolfpit, Harborow, and diuerse other. But
as most drouers are verie diligent to bring great store of these vnto
those places; so manie of them are too too lewd in abusing such as buie
them. For they haue a custome to make them looke faire to the eie, when
they come within two daies iourneie of the market, to driue them till
they sweat, &amp; for the space of eight or twelue houres, which being doone
they turne them all ouer the backs into some water, where they stand for
a season, and then go forward with them to the place appointed, where
they make sale of their infected ware, and such as by this meanes doo
fall into manie diseases and maladies. Of such outlandish horsses as are
dailie brought ouer vnto vs I speake not, as the genet of Spaine, the
courser of Naples, the hobbie of Ireland, the Flemish roile, and Scotish
nag, bicause that further spéech of them commeth not within the compasse
of this treatise, and for whose breed and maintenance (especiallie of
the greatest sort) king Henrie the eight erected a noble studderie and
for a time had verie good successe with them, till the officers waxing
wearie, procured a mixed brood of bastard races, whereby his good
purpose came to little effect. Sir Nicholas Arnold of late hath bred the
best horsses in England, and written of the maner of their production:
would to God his compasse of ground were like to that of Pella in Syria,
wherin the king of that nation had vsuallie a studderie of 30000 mares
and 300 stallions, as Strabo dooth remember Lib. 16. But to leaue this,
let vs sée what may be said of sheepe.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Shéepe.</span>
Our shéepe are verie excellent, sith for sweetnesse of flesh they passe
all other. And so much are our woolles to be preferred before those of
Milesia and other places, that if Iason had knowne the value of them
that are bred, and to be had in Britaine, he would neuer haue gone to
Colchis to looke for anie there. For as Dionysius Alexandrinus saith in
his De situ orbis, it may by spinning be made comparable to the spiders
web. What fooles then are our countrimen, in that they séeke to bereue
themselues of this commoditie, by practising dailie how to transfer the
same to other nations, in carieng ouer their rams &amp; ewes to bréed &amp;
increase among them? The first example hereof was giuen vnder Edward the
fourth, who not vnderstanding the botome of the sute of sundrie
traitorous merchants, that sought a present gaine with the perpetuall
hinderance of their countrie, licenced them to carie ouer certeine
numbers of them into Spaine, who hauing licence but for a few shipped
verie manie: a thing commonlie practised in other commodities also,
whereby the prince and hir land are not seldome times defrauded. But
such is our nature, and so blind are we in déed, that we sée no
inconuenience before we féele it: and for a present gaine we regard not
what damage may insue to our posteritie. Hereto some other man would ad
also the desire that we haue to benefit other countries, and to impech
our owne. And it is so sure as God liueth, that euerie trifle which
commeth from beyond the sea, though it be not woorth thrée pence, is
more estéemed than a continuall commoditie at home with vs, which far
excéedeth that value. In time past the vse of this commoditie consisted
(for the most part) in cloth and woolsteds: but now by meanes of
strangers succoured here from domesticall persecution, the same hath
béene imploied vnto sundrie other vses, as mockados, baies, vellures,
grograines, &amp;c: whereby the makers haue reaped no small commoditie. It
is furthermore to be noted, for the low countries of Belgie know it, and
dailie experience (notwithstanding the sharpenesse of our lawes to the
contrarie) dooth yet confirme it: that although our rams &amp; weathers doo
go thither from vs neuer so well headed according to their kind: yet
after they haue remained there a while, they cast there their heads, and
<span class="leftnote">Shéepe without hornes.</span>
from thencefoorth they remaine polled without any hornes at all. Certes
this kind of cattell is more cherished in England, than standeth well
with the commoditie of the commons, or prosperitie of diuerse townes,
whereof some are wholie conuerted to their féeding: yet such a
profitable sweetnesse is their fléece, such necessitie in their flesh,
and so great a benefit in the manuring of barren soile with their doong
and pisse, that their superfluous numbers are the better borne withall.
And there is neuer an husbandman (for now I speake not of our great
<span class="page"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>[Page 372]</span>
shéepemasters of whom some one man hath 20000) but hath more or lesse of
this cattell féeding on his fallowes and short grounds, which yéeld the
finer fléece, as Virgil (following Varro) well espied Georg. 3. where he
saith:</p>

<p class="ind1">"Si tibi lanicium curæ, primum aspera sylua,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lappæque tribulíque absint, fuge pabula læta."</p>

<p>Neuerthelesse the shéepe of our countrie are often troubled with the rot
(as are our swine with the measels though neuer so generallie) and manie
men are now and then great losers by the same: but after the calamitie
is ouer, if they can recouer and kéepe their new stocks sound for seauen
yeares togither, the former losse will easilie be recompensed with
double commoditie. Cardan writeth that our waters are hurtfull to our
shéepe, howbeit this is but his coniecture: for we know that our shéepe
are infected by going to the water, and take the same as a sure and
certeine token that a rot hath gotten hold of them, their liuers and
lights being alredie distempered through excessiue heat, which inforceth
them the rather to séeke vnto the water. Certes there is no parcell of
the maine, wherin a man shall generallie find more fine and wholesome
water than in England; and therefore it is impossible that our shéepe
should decaie by tasting of the same. Wherfore the hinderance by rot is
rather to be ascribed to the vnseasonablenes &amp; moisture of the weather
in summer, also their licking in of mildewes, gossamire, rowtie fogs, &amp;
ranke grasse, full of superfluous iuice: but speciallie (I saie) to ouer
moist wether, whereby the continuall raine pearsing into their hollow
felles, soketh foorthwith into their flesh, which bringeth them to their
baines. Being also infected their first shew of sickenesse is their
desire to drinke, so that our waters are not vnto them "Causa
ægritudinis," but "Signum morbi," what so euer Cardan doo mainteine to
the contrarie. There are (&amp; peraduenture no small babes) which are
growne to be so good husbands, that they can make account of euerie ten
kine to be cléerelie woorth twentie pounds in c&#333;mon and indifferent
yeares, if the milke of fiue shéepe be dailie added to the same. But as
I wote not how true this surmise is, bicause it is no part of my trade,
so I am sure hereof, that some housewiues can and doo ad dailie a lesse
proportion of ewes milke vnto the chéese of so manie kine, whereby their
cheese dooth the longer abide moist, and eateth more brickle and mellow
than otherwise it would.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Goats.</span>
Goats we haue plentie, and of sundrie colours in the west parts of
England; especiallie in and towards Wales, and amongst the rockie
hilles, by whome the owners doo reape no small aduantage: some also are
cherished elsewhere in diuerse stéeds for the benefit of such as are
diseased with sundrie maladies, vnto whom (as I heare) their milke,
chéese, and bodies of their yoong kids are iudged verie profitable, and
therefore inquired for of manie farre and néere. Certes I find among the
writers, that the milke of a goat is next in estimation to that of the
woman; for that it helpeth the stomach, remooueth oppilations and
stoppings of the liuer, and looseth the bellie. Some place also next
vnto it the milke of the ew: and thirdlie that of the cow. But hereof I
can shew no reason; onelie this I know, that ewes milke is fulsome,
sweet, and such in tast, as except such as are vsed vnto it no man will
gladlie yéeld to liue and féed withall.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Swine.</span>
As for swine, there is no place that hath greater store, nor more
wholesome in eating, than are these here in England, which neuerthelesse
doo neuer anie good till they come to the table. Of these some we eat
greene for porke, and other dried vp into bakon to haue it of more
continuance. Lard we make some though verie little, because it is
chargeable: neither haue we such vse thereof as is to be séene in France
and other countries, sith we doo either bake our meat with swéet suet of
beefe or mutton, and bast all our meat with sweet or salt butter, or
suffer the fattest to bast it selfe by leisure. In champaine countries
they are kept by herds, and an hogherd appointed to attend and wait vpon
them, who commonlie gathereth them togither by his noise and crie, and
leadeth them foorth to féed abroad in the fields. In some places also
women doo scowre and wet their cloths with their doong, as other doo
<span class="page"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>[Page 373]</span>
with hemlocks and netles: but such is the sauor of the cloths touched
withall, that I cannot abide to weare them on my bodie, more than such
as are scowred with the reffuse sope, than the which (in mine opinion)
there is none more vnkindlie sauor.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Bores.</span>
Of our tame bores we make brawne, which is a kind of meat not vsuallie
knowne to strangers (as I take it) otherwise would not the swart Rutters
and French cookes, at the losse of Calis (where they found great store
of this prouision almost in euerie house) haue attempted with ridiculous
successe to rost, bake, broile, &amp; frie the same for their masters, till
they were better informed. I haue heard moreouer, how a noble man of
England, not long since, did send ouer an hogshead of brawne readie
sowsed to a catholike gentleman of France, who supposing it to be fish,
reserued it till Lent, at which time he did eat thereof with verie great
frugalitie. Thereto he so well liked of the prouision it selfe, that he
wrote ouer verie earnestlie &amp; with offer of great recompense for more of
the same fish against the yeare insuing: whereas if he had knowne it to
haue beene flesh, he would not haue touched it (I dare saie) for a
thousand crownes without the popes dispensation. A fréend of mine also
dwelling sometime in Spaine, hauing certeine Iewes at his table, did set
brawne before them, whereof they did eat verie earnestlie, supposing it
to be a kind of fish not common in those parties: but when the goodman
of the house brought in the head in pastime among them, to shew what
they had eaten, they rose from the table, hied them home in hast, ech of
them procuring himselfe to vomit, some by oile, and some by other
meanes, till (as they supposed) they had clensed their stomachs of that
prohibited food. With vs it is accounted a great péece of seruice at the
table, from Nouember vntill Februarie be ended; but chéeflie in the
Christmasse time. With the same also we begin our dinners ech daie after
other: and because it is somewhat hard of digestion, a draught of
malueseie, bastard, or muscadell, is vsuallie droonke after it, where
either of them are conuenientlie to be had: otherwise the meaner sort
content themselues with their owne drinke, which at that season is
generallie verie strong, and stronger indéed than in all the yeare
<span class="leftnote">Brawne of the bore.</span>
beside. It is made commonlie of the fore part of a tame bore, set vp for
the purpose by the space of a whole yere or two, especiallie in
gentlemens houses (for the husbandmen and farmers neuer franke them for
their owne vse aboue thrée or foure moneths, or halfe a yéere at the
most) in which time he is dieted with otes and peason, and lodged on the
bare planks of an vneasie coat, till his fat be hardened sufficientlie
for their purpose: afterward he is killed, scalded, and cut out, and
then of his former parts is our brawne made, the rest is nothing so fat,
and therefore it beareth the name of sowse onelie, and is commonlie
reserued for the seruing man and hind, except it please the owner to
<span class="leftnote">Baked hog.</span>
haue anie part therof baked, which are then handled of custome after
this manner. The hinder parts being cut off, they are first drawne with
lard, and then sodden; being sodden they are sowsed in claret wine and
vineger a certeine space, and afterward baked in pasties, and eaten of
manie in stéed of the wild bore, and trulie it is verie good meat: the
pestles may be hanged vp a while to drie before they be drawne with lard
if you will, and thereby prooue the better. But hereof inough, and
therefore to come againe vnto our brawne. The necke peeces being cut off
round, are called collars of brawne, the shoulders are named shilds,
onelie the ribs reteine the former denomination, so that these aforesaid
péeces deserue the name of brawne: the bowels of the beast are commonlie
cast awaie because of their ranknesse, and so were likewise his stones;
till a foolish fantasie got hold of late amongst some delicate dames,
who haue now found the meanes to dresse them also with great cost for a
deintie dish, and bring them to the boord as a seruice among other of
like sort, though not without note of their desire to the prouocation of
fleshlie lust, which by this their fond curiositie is not a little
reuealed. When the bore is thus cut out, ech peece is wrapped vp, either
with bulrushes, ozier péeles, tape, inkle, or such like, and then sodden
in a lead or caldron togither, till they be so tender that a man may
thrust a brused rush or soft straw cleane through the fat: which being
doone, they take it vp, and laie it abroad to coole: afterward putting
it into close vessels, they powre either good small ale or béere mingled
with veriuice and salt thereto till it be couered, and so let it lie
<span class="page"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[Page 374]</span>
(now and then altering and changing the sowsing drinke least it should
wax sowre) till occasion serue to spend it out of the waie. Some vse to
make brawne of great barrow hogs, and séeth them, and sowse the whole,
as they doo that of the bore; and in my iudgement it is the better of
both, and more easie of digestion. But of brawne thus much; and so much
may seeme sufficient.</p>

<small>OF WILD AND TAME FOULES.</small><br />

CHAP. II.</h3>

<p>Order requireth that I speake somewhat of the foules also of England,
which I may easilie diuide into the wild &amp; tame: but alas such is my
small skill in foules, that to say the truth, I can neither recite their
numbers, nor well distinguish one kind of them from another. Yet this I
haue by generall knowledge, that there is no nation vnder the sunne,
which hath alreadie in the time of the yere more plentie of wild foule
than we, for so manie kinds as our Iland dooth bring foorth, and much
more would haue, if those of the higher soile might be spared but one
yeare or two, from the greedie engins of couetous foulers, which set
onlie for the pot &amp; purse. Certes this enormitie bred great trouble in
K. Iohns daies, insomuch that going in progresse about the tenth of his
reigne, he found little or no game wherewith to solace himself, or
exercise his falcons. Wherfore being at Bristow in the Christmas
insuing, he restreined all maner of hawking or taking of wild-foule
throughout England for a season, whereby the land within few yeares was
throughlie replenished againe. But what stand I vpon this impertinent
discourse? Of such therefore as are bred in our land, we haue the crane,
the bitter, the wild &amp; tame swan, the bustard, the herron, curlew,
snite, wildgoose, wind or doterell, brant, larke, plouer of both sorts,
lapwing, teele, wigeon, mallard, sheldrake, shoueler, pewet, seamew,
barnacle, quaile (who onelie with man are subiect to the falling
sickenesse) the notte, the oliet or olife, the dunbird, woodcocke,
partrich and feasant, besides diuerse other, whose names to me are
vtterlie vnknowne, and much more the taste of their flesh, wherewith I
was neuer acquainted. But as these serue not at all seasons, so in their
seuerall turnes there is no plentie of them wanting, whereby the tables
of the nobilitie and gentrie should séeme at anie time furnisht. But of
all these the production of none is more maruellous in my mind, than
that of the barnacle, whose place of generation we haue sought oft times
so farre as the Orchades, whereas peraduenture we might haue found the
same neerer home, and not onelie vpon the coasts of Ireland, but euen in
our owne riuers. If I should say how either these or some such other
foule not much vnlike vnto them haue bred of late times (for their place
of generation is not perpetuall, but as opportunitie serueth, and the
circumstances doo minister occasion) in the Thames mouth, I doo not
thinke that manie will beleeue me: yet such a thing hath there béene
scene, where a kind of foule had his beginning vpon a short tender shrub
standing néere vnto the shore, from whence when their time came, they
fell downe, either into the salt water and liued, or vpon the drie land
and perished, as Pena the French herbarian hath also noted in the verie
end of his herball. What I for mine owne part haue séene here by
experience, I haue alreadie so touched in the chapter of Ilands, that it
should be but time spent in vaine to repeat it here againe. Looke
therefore in the description of Man or Manaw for more of these
barnacles, as also in the eleuenth chapter of the description of
Scotland, &amp; I doo not doubt but you shall in some respect be satisfied
in the generation of these foules. As for egrets, pawpers, and such
like, they are dailie brought vnto vs from beyond the sea, as if all the
foule of our countrie could not suffice to satisfie our delicate
appetites.</p>

<p>Our tame foule are such (for the most part) as are common both to vs and
to other countries, as cocks, hens, géese, duckes, peacocks of Inde,
pigeons, now an hurtfull foule by reason of their multitudes, and number
of houses dailie erected for their increase (which the bowres of the
countrie call in scorne almes houses, and dens of theeues, and such
<span class="page"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>[Page 375]</span>
like) wherof there is great plentie in euerie farmers yard. They are
kept there also to be sold either for readie monie in the open markets,
or else to be spent at home in good companie amongst their neighbors
without reprehension or fines. Neither are we so miserable in England (a
thing onelie granted vnto vs by the especiall grace of God, and libertie
of our princes) as to dine or sup with a quarter of a hen, or to make so
great a repast with a cocks combe, as they doo in some other countries:
but if occasion serue, the whole carcasses of manie capons, hens,
pigeons, and such like doo oft go to wracke, beside béefe, mutton,
veale, and lambe: all which at euerie feast are taken for necessarie
dishes amongest the communaltie of England.</p>

<p>The gelding of cocks, whereby capons are made, is an ancient practise
brought in of old time by the Romans when they dwelt here in this land:
but the gelding of turkies or Indish peacocks is a newer deuise: and
certeinlie not vsed amisse, sith the rankenesse of that bird is verie
much abated thereby, and the strong taste of the flesh in sundrie wise
amended. If I should say that ganders grow also to be gelded, I suppose
that some will laugh me to scorne, neither haue I tasted at anie time of
such a foule so serued, yet haue I heard it more than once to be vsed in
the countrie, where their géese are driuen to the field like heards of
cattell by a gooseheard, a toie also no lesse to be maruelled at than
the other. For as it is rare to heare of a gelded gander, so is it
strange to me to sée or heare of géese to be led to the field like
shéepe: yet so it is, &amp; their gooseheard carieth a rattle of paper or
parchment with him, when he goeth about in the morning to gather his
goslings togither, the noise whereof commeth no sooner to their eares,
than they fall to gagling, and hasten to go with him. If it happen that
the gates be not yet open, or that none of the house be stirring, it is
ridiculous to sée how they will peepe vnder the doores, and neuer leaue
creaking and gagling till they be let out vnto him to ouertake their
fellowes. With vs where I dwell they are not kept in this sort, nor in
manie other places, neither are they kept so much for their bodies as
their feathers. Some hold furthermore an opinion, that in ouer ranke
soiles their doong dooth so qualifie the batablenesse of the soile, that
their cattell is thereby kept from the garget, and sundrie other
diseases, although some of them come to their ends now and then, by
licking vp of their feathers. I might here make mention of other foules
producted by the industrie of man, as betwéene the fesant cocke and
doonghill hen, or betwéene the fesant and the ringdooue, the peacocke
and the turkie hen, the partrich and the pigeon: but sith I haue no more
knowledge of these, than what I haue gotten by mine eare, I will not
meddle with them. Yet Cardan speaking of the second sort, dooth affirme
it to be a foule of excellent beautie. I would likewise intreat of other
foules which we repute vncleane, as rauens, crowes, pies, choughes,
rookes, kites, iaies, ringtailes, starlings, woodspikes, woodnawes,
rauens, &amp;c: but sith they abound in all countries, though peraduenture
most of all in England (by reason of our negligence) I shall not néed to
spend anie time in the rehearsall of them. Neither are our crowes and
choughs cherished of purpose to catch vp the woormes that bréed in our
soiles (as Polydor supposeth) sith there are no vplandish townes but
haue (or should haue) nets of their owne in store to catch them withall.
Sundrie acts of parlement are likewise made for their vtter destruction,
as also the spoile of other rauenous fouls hurtfull to pultrie, conies,
lambs, and kids, whose valuation of reward to him that killeth them is
after the head: a deuise brought from the Goths, who had the like
ordinance for the destruction of their white crowes, and tale made by
the becke, which killed both lambs and pigs. The like order is taken
with vs for our vermines, as with them also for the rootage out of their
wild beasts, sauing that they spared their greatest beares, especiallie
the white, whose skins are by custome &amp; priuilege reserued to couer
those planchers wherevpon their priests doo stand at Masse, least he
should take some vnkind cold in such a long péece of worke: and happie
is the man that may prouide them for him, for he shall haue pardon
inough for that so religious an act, to last if he will till doomes day
doo approch; and manie thousands after. Nothing therefore can be more
vnlikelie to be true, than that these noisome creatures are nourished
amongst vs to deuoure our wormes, which doo not abound much more in
<span class="page"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>[Page 376]</span>
England than elsewhere in other countries of the maine. It may be that
some looke for a discourse also of our other foules in this place at my
hand, as nightingales, thrushes, blackebirds, mauises, ruddocks,
redstarts or dunocks, larkes, tiuits, kingsfishers, buntings, turtles
white or graie, linets, bulfinshes, goldfinshes, washtailes,
cheriecrackers, yellowhamers, felfares, &amp;c: but I should then spend more
time vpon them than is conuenient. Neither will I speake of our costlie
and curious auiaries dailie made for the better hearing of their
melodie, and obseruation of their natures: but I cease also to go anie
further in these things, hauing (as I thinke) said inough alreadie of
these that I haue named.</p>

<h3><a name="d3-cap3" id="d3-cap3"></a>
<small>OF FISH VSUALLIE TAKEN VPON OUR COASTS.</small><br />

CHAP. III.</h3>

<p>I haue in my description of waters, as occasion hath serued, intreated
of the names of some of the seuerall fishes which are commonlie to bée
found in our riuers. Neuerthelesse as euerie water hath a sundrie
mixture, and therefore is not stored with euerie kind: so there is
almost no house, euen of the meanest bowres, which haue not one or mo
ponds or holes made for reseruation of water vnstored with some of them,
as with tench, carpe, breame, roch, dace, eeles, or such like as will
liue and bréed togither. Certes it is not possible for me to deliuer the
names of all such kinds of fishes as our riuers are found to beare: yet
least I should séeme iniurious to the reader, in not deliuering so manie
of them as haue béene brought to my knowledge, I will not let to set
them downe as they doo come to mind. Besides the salmons therefore,
which are not to be taken from the middest of September to the middest
of Nouember, and are verie plentifull in our greatest riuers, as their
yoong store are not to be touched from mid Aprill vnto Midsummer, we
haue the trout, barbell, graile, powt, cheuin, pike, goodgeon, smelt,
perch, menan, shrimpes, creuises, lampreies, and such like, whose
preseruation is prouided for by verie sharpe lawes, not onelie in our
riuers, but also in plashes or lakes and ponds, which otherwise would
bring small profit to the owners, and doo much harme by continuall
maintenance of idle persons, who would spend their whole times vpon
their bankes, not coueting to labour with their hands, nor follow anie
good trade. Of all these there are none more preiudiciall to their
neighbours that dwell in the same water, than the pike and éele, which
commonlie deuoure such fish or frie and spawne as they may get and come
by. Neuerthelesse the pike is fréend vnto the tench, as to his leach &amp;
surgeon. For when the fishmonger hath opened his side and laid out his
riuet and fat vnto the buier, for the better vtterance of his ware, and
can not make him away at that present, he laieth the same againe into
the proper place, and sowing vp the wound, he restoreth him to the pond
where tenches are, who neuer cease to sucke and licke his greeued place,
till they haue restored him to health, and made him readie to come
againe to the stall, when his turne shall come about. I might here make
report how the pike, carpe, and some other of our riuer fishes are sold
by inches of cleane fish, from the eies or gilles to the crotch of the
tailes, but it is needlesse: also how the pike as he ageth receiueth
diuerse names, as from a frie to a gilthed, from a gilthed to a pod,
from a pod to a iacke, from a iacke to a pickerell, from a pickerell to
a pike, and last of all to a luce; also that a salmon is the first yeare
a grauellin, and commonlie so big as an herring, the second a salmon
peale, the third a pug, and the fourth a salmon: but this is in like
sort vnnecessarie.</p>

<p>I might finallie tell you, how that in fennie riuers sides if you cut a
turffe, and laie it with the grasse downewards, vpon the earth, in such
sort as the water may touch it as it passeth by, you shall haue a brood
of éeles, it would seeme a wonder; and yet it is beleeued with no lesse
assurance of some, than that an horse haire laid in a pale full of the
like water will in short time stirre and become a liuing creature. But
sith the certeintie of these things is rather prooued by few than the
certeintie of them knowne vnto manie, I let it passe at this time.
<span class="page"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>[Page 377]</span>
Neuerthelesse this is generallie obserued in the maintenance of frie so
well in riuers as in ponds, that in the time of spawne we vse to throw
in faggots made of willow and sallow, and now and then of bushes for
want of the other, whereby such spawne as falleth into the same is
preserued and kept from the pike, perch, éele and other fish, of which
the carpe also will féed vpon his owne, and thereby hinder the store and
increase of proper kind. Some vse in euerie fift or seauenth yeere to
laie their great ponds drie for all the summer time, to the end they may
gather grasse, and a thin swart for the fish to feed vpon; and
afterwards store them with bréeders, after the water be let of new
againe into them: finallie, when they haue spawned, they draw out the
bréeders, leauing not aboue foure or six behind, euen in the greatest
ponds, by meanes whereof the rest doo prosper the better: and this
obseruation is most vsed in carpe and breame; as for perch (a delicate
fish) it prospereth euerie where, I meane so well in ponds as riuers,
and also in motes and pittes, as I doo know by experience, though their
bottoms be but claie. More would I write of our fresh fish, if anie more
were needfull; wherefore I will now turne ouer vnto such of the salt
water as are taken vpon our coasts. As our foules therefore haue their
seasons, so likewise haue all our sorts of sea fish: whereby it commeth
to passe that none, or at the leastwise verie few of them are to be had
at all times. Neuerthelesse, the seas that inuiron our coasts, are of
all other most plentifull: for as by reason of their depth they are a
great succour, so our low shores minister great plentie of food vnto the
fish that come thereto, no place being void or barren, either through
want of food for them, or the falles of filthie riuers, which naturallie
annoie them. In December therefore and Ianuarie we commonlie abound in
herring and red fish, as rochet, and gurnard. In Februarie and March we
féed on plaice, trowts, turbut, muskles, &amp;c. In April and Maie, with
makrell, and cockles. In Iune and Iulie, with conger. In August and
September, with haddocke and herring: and the two moneths insuing with
the same, as also thornbacke and reigh of all sorts; all which are the
most vsuall, and wherewith our common sort are best of all refreshed.</p>

<p>For mine owne part I am greatlie acquainted neither with the seasons,
nor yet with the fish it selfe: and therefore if I should take vpon me
to describe or speake of either of them absolutelie, I should enterprise
more than I am able to performe, and go in hand with a greater matter
than I can well bring about. It shall suffice therefore to declare what
sorts of fishes I haue most often séene, to the end I may not altogither
passe ouer this chapter without the rehersall of something, although the
whole summe of that which I haue to saie be nothing indeed, if the
performance of a full discourse hereof be anie thing hardlie required.</p>

<p>Of fishes therefore as I find fiue sorts, the flat, the round, the long,
<span class="leftnote">Flat fish.</span>
the legged and shelled: so the flat are diuided into the smooth, scaled
and tailed. Of the first are the plaice, the but, the turbut, birt,
floke or sea flounder, dorreie, dab, &amp;c. Of the second the soles, &amp;c. Of
the third, our chaits, maidens, kingsons, flath and thornbacke, whereof
the greater be for the most part either dried and carried into other
countries, or sodden, sowsed, &amp; eaten here at home, whilest the lesser
be fried or buttered; soone after they be taken as prouision not to be
<span class="leftnote">Round fish.</span>
kept long for feare of putrifaction. Vnder the round kinds are commonlie
comprehended lumps, an vglie fish to sight, and yet verie delicat in
eating, if it be kindlie dressed: the whiting (an old waiter or seruitor
in the court) the rochet, sea breame, pirle, hake, sea trowt, gurnard,
haddocke, cod, herring, pilchard, sprat, and such like. And these are
they whereof I haue best knowledge, and be commonlie to be had in their
times vpon our coasts. Vnder this kind also are all the great fish
conteined, as the seale, the dolphin, the porpoise, the thirlepole,
whale, and whatsoeuer is round of bodie be it neuer so great and huge.
<span class="leftnote">Long fish.<br />
Legged fish.</span>
Of the long sort are congers, eeles, garefish, and such other of that
forme. Finallie, of the legged kind we haue not manie, neither haue I
seene anie more of this sort than the Polypus called in English the
lobstar, crafish or creuis, and the crab. As for the little crafishes
they are not taken in the sea, but plentifullie in our fresh riuers in

maner, and oft by likenesse of colour with the stones among which they
lie, deceiue euen the skilfull takers of them, except they vse great

diligence. Carolus Stephanus in his maison rustique, doubted whether
these lobstars be fish or not; and in the end concludeth them to grow of
the purgation of the water as dooth the frog, and these also not to be
eaten, for that they be strong and verie hard of digestion. But hereof
let other determine further.</p>

<p>I might here speake of sundrie other fishes now and then taken also vpon
our coasts: but sith my mind is onelie to touch either all such as are
vsuallie gotten, or so manie of them onelie as I can well rehearse vpon
certeine knowledge, I thinke it good at this time to forbeare the
further intreatie of them. As touching the shellie sort, we haue plentie
of oisters, whose valure in old time for their swéetnesse was not
vnknowne in Rome (although Mutianus as Plinie noteth lib. 32, cap. 6.
preferre the Cyzicene before them) and these we haue in like maner of
diuerse quantities, and no lesse varietie also of our muskles and
cockles. We haue in like sort no small store of great whelkes, scalops
and perewinkles, and each of them brought farre into the land from the
sea coast in their seuerall seasons. And albeit our oisters are
generallie forborne in the foure hot moneths of the yeare, that is to
saie, Maie, Iune, Iulie, and August, which are void of the letter R: yet
in some places they be continuallie eaten, where they be kept in pits as
I haue knowne by experience. And thus much of our sea fish as a man in
maner vtterlie vnacquainted with their diuersitie of kinds: yet so much
haue I yéelded to doo, hoping hereafter to saie somewhat more, and more
orderlie of them, if it shall please God that I may liue and haue
leasure once againe to peruse this treatise, and so make vp a perfect
péece of worke, of that which as you now sée is verie slenderlie
attempted and begun.</p>

<small>OF SAUAGE BEASTS AND VERMINES.</small><br />

CHAP. IV.</h3>

<p>It is none of the least blessings wherewith God hath indued this Iland,
that it is void of noisome beasts, as lions, beares, tigers, pardes,
wolfes, &amp; such like, by means whereof our countrimen may trauell in
safetie, &amp; our herds and flocks remaine for the most part abroad in the
field without anie herdman or kéeper.</p>

<p>This is cheefelie spoken of the south and southwest parts of the Iland.
For wheras we that dwell on this side of the Twed, may safelie boast of
our securitie in this behalfe: yet cannot the Scots doo the like in
<span class="leftnote">Woolfes.</span>
euerie point within their kingdome, sith they haue greeuous woolfes and
cruell foxes, beside some other of like disposition continuallie
conuersant among them, to the generall hinderance of their husbandmen,
and no small damage vnto the inhabiters of those quarters. The happie
and fortunate want of these beasts in England is vniuersallie ascribed
to the politike gouernement of king Edgar, who to the intent the whole
countrie might once be clensed and clearelie rid of them, charged the
conquered Welshmen (who were then pestered with these rauenous creatures
<span class="leftnote">Tribute of Woolfes skins.</span>
aboue measure) to paie him a yearelie tribute of woolfes skinnes, to be
gathered within the land. He appointed them thereto a certeine number of
three hundred, with free libertie for their prince to hunt &amp; pursue them
ouer all quarters of the realme; as our chronicles doo report. Some
there be which write how Ludwall prince of Wales paid yearelie to king
Edgar this tribute of thrée hundred woolfes, whose carcases being
brought into Lhoegres, were buried at Wolfpit in Cambridgeshire, and
that by meanes thereof within the compasse and terme of foure yeares,
none of those noisome creatures were left to be heard of within Wales
and England. Since this time also we read not that anie woolfe hath
béene séene here that hath beene bred within the bounds and limits of
our countrie: howbeit there haue béene diuerse brought ouer from beyond
the seas for gréedinesse of gaine, and to make monie onlie by the gasing
and gaping of our people vpon them, who couet oft to see them being
strange beasts in their eies, and sildome knowne (as I haue said) in
England.</p>
<p><span class="page"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>[Page 379]</span></p>

<p>Lions we haue had verie manie in the north parts of Scotland, and those
with maines of no lesse force than they of Mauritania were sometimes
reported to be; but how and when they were destroied as yet I doo not
read. They had in like sort no lesse plentie of wild and cruell buls,
which the princes and their nobilitie in the frugall time of the land
did hunt, and follow for the triall of their manhood, and by pursute
either on horssebacke or foot in armor; notwithstanding that manie times
they were dangerouslie assailed by them. But both these sauage cretures
are now not heard of, or at the least wise the later scarselie known in
the south parts. Howbeit this I gather by their being here, that our
Iland was not cut from the maine by the great deluge or flood of Noah:
but long after, otherwise the generation of those &amp; other like creatures
could not haue extended into our Ilands. For, that anie man would of set
purpose replenish the countrie with them for his pleasure and pastime in
hunting, I can in no wise beléeue.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Foxes.<br />
Badgers.</span>
Of foxes we haue some but no great store, and also badgers in our sandie
&amp; light grounds, where woods, firzes, broome, and plentie of shrubs are
to shrowd them in, when they be from their borrowes, and thereto warrens
of conies at hand to féed vpon at will. Otherwise in claie, which we
call the cledgie mould, we sildom heare of anie, bicause the moisture
and toughnesse of the soile is such, as will not suffer them to draw and
make their borrowes déepe. Certes if I may fréelie saie what I thinke, I
suppose that these two kinds (I meane foxes and badgers) are rather
preserued by gentlemen to hunt and haue pastime withall at their owne
pleasures, than otherwise suffered to liue, as not able to be destroied
bicause of their great numbers. For such is the scantitie of them here
in England, in comparison of the plentie that is to be seene in other
countries, and so earnestlie are the inhabitants bent to root them out,
that except it had béene to beare thus with the recreations of their
superiors in this behalfe, it could not otherwise haue béene chosen, but
that they should haue béene vtterlie destroied by manie yeares agone.</p>

<p>I might here intreat largelie of other vermine, as the polcat, the
miniuer, the weasell, stote, fulmart, squirrill, fitchew, and such like,
which Cardan includeth vnder the word Mustela: also of the otter, and
<span class="leftnote">Beuers.</span>
likewise of the beuer, whose hinder féet and taile onlie are supposed to
be fish. Certes the taile of this beast is like vnto a thin whetstone,
as the bodie vnto a monsterous rat: the beast also it selfe is of such
force in the téeth, that it will gnaw an hole through a thicke planke,
or shere thorough a dubble billet in a night; it loueth also the
stillest riuers: &amp; it is giuen to them by nature, to go by flockes vnto
the woods at hand, where they gather sticks wherewith to build their
nests, wherein their bodies lie drie aboue the water, although they so
prouide most commonlie, that their tailes may hang within the same. It
is also reported that their said tailes are a delicate dish, and their
stones of such medicinable force, that (as Vertomannus saith) foure men
smelling vnto them each after other did bleed at the nose through their
attractiue force, procéeding from a vehement sauour wherewith they are
indued: there is greatest plentie of them in Persia, chéefelie about
Balascham, from whence they and their dried cods are brought into all
quarters of the world, though not without some forgerie by such as
prouide them. And of all these here remembred, as the first sorts are
plentifull in euerie wood and hedgerow: so these latter, especiallie the
otter (for to saie the truth we haue not manie beuers, but onelie in the
Teifie in Wales) is not wanting or to séeke in manie, but most streams
and riuers of this Ile: but it shall suffice in this sort to haue named
<span class="leftnote">Marterns.</span>
them as I doo finallie the marterne, a beast of the chase, although for
number I worthilie doubt whether that of our beuers or marterns may be
thought to be the lesse.</p>

<p>Other pernicious beasts we haue not, except you repute the great plentie
of red &amp; fallow déere, whose colours are oft garled white and blacke,
all white or all blacke, and store of conies amongst the hurtfull sort.
Which although that of themselues they are not offensiue at all, yet
their great numbers are thought to be verie preiudiciall, and therfore
iustlie reprooued of many; as are in like sort our huge flocks of
shéepe, whereon the greatest part of our soile is emploied almost in
euerie place, and yet our mutton, wooll, and felles neuer the better
<span class="page"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>[Page 380]</span>
cheape. The yoong males which our fallow deere doo bring foorth, are
commonlie named according to their seuerall ages: for the first yéere it
is a fawne, the second a puckot, the third a serell, the fourth a soare,
the fift a bucke of the first head; not bearing the name of a bucke till
he be fiue yéers old: and from hencefoorth his age is commonlie knowne
by his head or horns. Howbeit this notice of his yéers is not so
certeine, but that the best woodman may now and then be deceiued in that
account: for in some grounds a bucke of the first head will be so well
headed as another in a high rowtie soile will be in the fourth. It is
also much to be maruelled at, that whereas they doo yéerelie mew and
cast their horns; yet in fighting they neuer breake off where they doo
grife or mew. Furthermore, in examining the condition of our red déere,
I find that the yoong male is called in the first yéere a calfe, in the
second a broket, the third a spaie, the fourth a stagon or stag, the
fift a great stag, the sixt an hart, and so foorth vnto his death. And
with him in degrée of venerie are accounted the hare, bore, and woolfe.
The fallow déere as bucks and does, are nourished in parkes, and conies
in warrens and burrowes. As for hares, they run at their owne aduenture,
except some gentleman or other (for his pleasure) doo make an inclosure
<span class="leftnote">Stags.</span>
for them. Of these also the stag is accounted for the most noble game,
the fallow déere is the next, then the roe, whereof we haue indifferent
store; and last of all the hare, not the least in estimation, because
the hunting of that seelie beast is mother to all the terms, blasts, and
artificiall deuises that hunters doo vse. All which (notwithstanding our
custome) are pastimes more méet for ladies and gentlewomen to exercise
(whatsoeuer Franciscus Patritius saith to the contrarie in his
institution of a prince) than for men of courage to follow, whose
hunting should practise their armes in tasting of their manhood, and
dealing with such beasts as eftsoones will turne againe, and offer them
the hardest rather than their horsses féet, which manie times may carrie
them with dishonour from the field. Surelie this noble kind of hunting
onelie did great princes frequent in times past, as it may yet appéere
by the histories of their times, especiallie of Alexander, who at vacant
times hunted the tiger, the pard, the bore, and the beare, but most
willinglie lions, because of the honorable estimation of that beast;
insomuch that at one time he caused an od or chosen lion (for force and
beautie) to be let foorth vnto him hand to hand, with whome he had much
businesse, albeit that in the end he ouerthrew and killed the beast.
Herevnto beside that which we read of the vsuall hunting of the princes
and kings of Scotland, of the wild bull, woolfe, &amp;c: the example of king
Henrie the first of England, who disdaining (as he termed them) to
follow or pursue cowards, cherished of set purpose sundrie kinds of wild
beasts, as bears, libards, ounces, lions at Woodstocke, &amp; one or two
other places in England, which he walled about with hard stone, An.
1120, and where he would often fight with some one of them hand to hand,
when they did turne againe and make anie raise vpon him: but chéeflie he
loued to hunt the lion and the bore, which are both verie dangerous
exercises, especiallie that with the lion, except some policie be found
wherwith to trouble his eiesight in anie manner of wise. For though the
bore be fierce, and hath learned by nature to harden his flesh and skin
against the trées, to sharpen his teeth, and defile himselfe with earth,
thereby to prohibit the entrance of the weapons: yet is the sport
somewhat more easie, especiallie where two stand so neere togither, that
the one (if néed be) may helpe and be a succour to the other. Neither
would he cease for all this to follow his pastime, either on horssebacke
or on foot, as occasion serued, much like the yoonger Cyrus. I haue read
of wild bores and bulles to haue béene about Blackleie néere Manchester,
whither the said prince would now and then resort also for his solace in
that behalfe, as also to come by those excellent falcons then bred
thereabouts; but now they are gone, especiallie the bulles, as I haue
said alreadie.</p>

<p>King Henrie the fift in his beginning thought it a méere scofferie to
pursue anie fallow déere with hounds or greihounds, but supposed
himselfe alwaies to haue doone a sufficient act when he had tired them
by his owne trauell on foot, and so killed them with his hands in the
vpshot of that exercise and end of his recreation. Certes herein he
resembled Polymnestor Milesius, of whome it is written, how he ran so
swiftlie, that he would and did verie often ouertake hares for his
<span class="page"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>[Page 381]</span>
pleasure, which I can hardlie beleeue: and therefore much lesse that one
Lidas did run so lightlie and swiftlie after like game, that as he
passed ouer the sand, he left not so much as the prints of his feet
behind him. And thus did verie manie in like sort with the hart (as I
doo read) but this I thinke was verie long agone, when men were farre
higher and swifter than they are now: and yet I denie not, but rather
grant willinglie that the hunting of the red deere is a right princelie
pastime. In diuerse forren countries they cause their red and fallow
déere to draw the plough, as we doo our oxen and horsses. In some places
<span class="leftnote">Hinds haue béene milked.</span>
also they milke their hinds as we doo here our kine and goats. And the
experience of this latter is noted by Giraldus Cambrensis to haue beene
séene and vsed in Wales, where he did eat cheese made of hinds milke, at
such time as Baldwine archbishop of Canturburie preached the croisad
there, when they were both lodged in a gentlemans house, whose wife of
purpose kept a deirie of the same. As for the plowing with vres (which I
suppose to be vnlikelie) because they are (in mine opinion) vntameable
and alkes a thing commonlie vsed in the east countries; here is no place
to speake of it, since we want these kind of beasts, neither is it my
purpose to intreat at large of other things than are to be seene in
England. Wherfore I will omit to saie anie more of wild and sauage
beasts at this time, thinking my selfe to haue spoken alreadie
sufficientlie of this matter, if not too much in the iudgement of the
curious.</p>

<small>OF HAWKES AND RAUENOUS FOULES.</small><br />

CHAP. V.</h3>

<p>I can not make (as yet) anie iust report how manie sorts of hawkes are
bred within this realme. Howbeit which of those that are vsuallie had
among vs are disclosed with in this land, I thinke it more easie and
lesse difficult to set downe. First of all therefore that we haue the
egle, common experience dooth euidentlie confirme, and diuerse of our
rockes whereon they bréed, if speach did serue, could well declare the
same. But the most excellent aierie of all is not much from Chester, at
a castell called Dinas Bren, sometime builded by Brennus, as our writers
doo remember. Certes this castell is no great thing, but yet a pile
sometime verie strong and inaccessible for enimies, though now all
ruinous as manie other are. It standeth vpon an hard rocke, in the side
whereof an eagle bréedeth euerie yeare. This also is notable in the
ouerthrow of hir nest (a thing oft attempted) that he which goeth
thither must be sure of two large baskets, and so prouide to be let
downe thereto, that he may sit in the one and be couered with the other:
for otherwise the eagle would kill him, and teare the flesh from his
bones with hir sharpe talons though his apparell were neuer so good. The
common people call this foule an erne, but as I am ignorant whither the
word eagle and erne doo shew anie difference of sexe, I meane betwéene
the male and female, so we haue great store of them. And néere to the
places where they bréed, the commons complaine of great harme to be
doone by them in their fields: for they are able to beare a yoong lambe
or kid vnto their neasts, therwith to féed their yoong and come againe
for more. I was once of the opinion that there was a diuersitie of kind
betwéene the eagle and the erne, till I perceiued that our nation vsed
the word erne in most places for the eagle. We haue also the lanner and
the lanneret: the tersell and the gosehawke: the musket and the
sparhawke: the iacke and the hobbie: and finallie some (though verie
few) marlions. And these are all the hawkes that I doo heare as yet to
be bred within this Iland. Howbeit as these are not wanting with vs, so
are they not verie plentifull: wherefore such as delite in hawking doo
make their chiefe purueiance &amp; prouision for the same out of Danske,
Germanie, and the Eastcountries, from whence we haue them in great
abundance, and at excessiue prices, whereas at home and where they be
bred they are sold for almost right naught, and vsuallie brought to the
markets as chickins, pullets and pigeons are with vs, and there bought
<span class="page"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>[Page 382]</span>
vp to be eaten (as we doo the aforesaid foules) almost of euerie man. It
is said that the sparhawke preieth not vpon the foule in the morning
that she taketh ouer euen, but as loth to haue double benefit by one
seelie foule, dooth let it go to make some shift for it selfe. But
hereof as I stand in some doubt, so this I find among the writers
worthie the noting, that the sparhawke is enimie to yoong children, as
is also the ape; but of the pecocke she is maruellouslie afraid &amp; so
appalled, that all courage &amp; stomach for a time is taken from hir vpon
the sight thereof. But to proceed with the rest. Of other rauenous birds
we haue also verie great plentie, as the bussard, the kite, the
ringtaile, dunkite, &amp; such as often annoie our countrie dames by
spoiling of their yoong bréeds of chickens, duckes and goslings,
wherevnto our verie rauens and crowes haue learned also the waie: and so
much are our rauens giuen to this kind of spoile, that some idle and
curious heads of set purpose haue manned, reclaimed, and vsed them in
stéed of hawkes, when other could not be had. Some doo imagine that the
rauen should be the vulture, and I was almost persuaded in times past to
beleeue the same: but finding of late a description of the vulture,
which better agreeth with the forme of a second kind of eagle, I fréelie
surcease to be longer of that opinion: for as it hath after a sort the
shape, colour, and quantitie of an eagle, so are the legs and feet more
hairie and rough, their sides vnder their wings better couered with
thicke downe (wherewith also their gorge or a part of their brest vnder
their throtes is armed, and not with fethers) than are the like parts of
the eagle, and vnto which portraiture there is no member of the rauen
(who is also verie blacke of colour) that can haue anie resemblance: we
haue none of them in England to my knowledge, if we haue, they go
generallie vnder the name of eagle or erne. Neither haue we the pygargus
or gripe, wherefore I haue no occasion to intreat further. I haue séene
the carren crowes so cunning also by their owne industrie of late, that
they haue vsed to soare ouer great riuers (as the Thames for example) &amp;
suddenlie comming downe haue caught a small fish in their féet &amp; gone
awaie withall without wetting of their wings. And euen at this present
the aforesaid riuer is not without some of them, a thing (in my opinion)
not a little to be wondered at. We haue also ospraies which bréed with
vs in parks and woods, wherby the kéepers of the same doo reape in
bréeding time no small commoditie: for so soone almost as the yoong are
hatched, they tie them to the but ends or ground ends of sundrie trees,
where the old ones finding them, doo neuer cease to bring fish vnto
them, which the keepers take &amp; eat from them, and commonlie is such as
is well fed, or not of the worst sort. It hath not béene my hap hitherto
to see anie of these foules, &amp; partlie through mine owne negligence: but
I heare that it hath one foot like an hawke to catch hold withall, and
another resembling a goose wherewith to swim; but whether it be so or
not so, I refer the further search and triall thereof vnto some other.
This neuertheles is certeine that both aliue and dead, yea euen hir
verie oile is a deadlie terrour to such fish as come within the wind of
it. There is no cause wherefore I should describe the cormorant amongst
hawkes, of which some be blacke and manie pied chiefelie about the Ile
of Elie, where they are taken for the night rauen, except I should call
him a water hawke. But sith such dealing is not conuenient, let vs now
sée what may be said of our venemous wormes, and how manie kinds we haue
of them within our realme and countrie.</p>

<h3><a name="d3-cap6" id="d3-cap6"></a>
<small>OF VENEMOUS BEASTS.</small><br />

CHAP. VI.</h3>

<p>If I should go about to make anie long discourse of venemous beasts or
wormes bred in England, I should attempt more than occasion it selfe
would readilie offer, sith we haue verie few worms, but no beasts at
all, that are thought by their naturall qualities to be either venemous
or hurtfull. First of all therefore we haue the adder (in our old Saxon
toong called an atter) which some men doo not rashlie take to be the
<span class="page"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>[Page 383]</span>
viper. Certes if it be so, then is it not the viper author of the death
<span class="rightnote">* <em>Galenus de Theriaca ad Pisonem.</em>
* <em>Plin. lib. 10. cap. 62.</em></span>
of hir * parents, as some histories affirme; and thereto Encelius a
late writer in his "De re metallica," lib. 3. cap. 38. where he maketh
mention of a she adder which he saw in Sala, whose wombe (as he saith)
was eaten out after a like fashion, hir yoong ones lieng by hir in the
sunne shine, as if they had béene earth worms. Neuerthelesse as he
nameth them "Viperas," so he calleth the male Echis, and the female
Echidna, concluding in the end that Echis is the same serpent which his
countrimen to this daie call Ein atter, as I haue also noted before out
of a Saxon dictionarie. For my part I am persuaded that the slaughter of
their parents is either not true at all, or not alwaies (although I
doubt not but that nature hath right well prouided to inhibit their
superfluous increase by some meanes or other) and so much the rather am
I led herevnto, for that I gather by Nicander, that of all venemous
worms the viper onelie bringeth out hir yoong aliue, and therefore is
called in Latine "Vipera quasi viuipara:" but of hir owne death he dooth
not (to my remembrance) saie any thing. It is testified also by other in
other words, &amp; to the like sense, that "Echis id est vipera sola ex
serpentibus non oua sed animalia parit." And it may well be, for I
remember that I haue read in Philostratus "De vita Appollonij,"</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Adder or viper.</span>
how he saw a viper licking hir yoong. I did see an adder once my selfe
that laie (as I thought) sléeping on a moulehill, out of whose mouth
came eleuen yoong adders of twelue or thirtéene inches in length a
péece, which plaied to and fro in the grasse one with another, till some
of them espied me. So soone therefore as they saw my face, they ran againe into
<span class="leftnote">See <em>Aristotle Animalium lib. 5. cap. vltimo, &amp;
Theophrast. lib. 7. cap. 13</em>.</span>
the mouth of their dam, whome I killed,
and then found each of them shrowded in a distinct cell or pannicle in
hir bellie, much like vnto a soft white iellie, which maketh me to be of
the opinion that our adder is the viper indéed. The colour of their skin
is for the most part like rustie iron or iron graie: but such as be
verie old resemble a ruddie blew, &amp; as once in the yeare, to wit, in
Aprill or about the beginning of Maie they cast their old skins (whereby
as it is thought their age reneweth) so their stinging bringeth death
without present remedie be at hand, the wounded neuer ceasing to swell,
neither the venem to worke till the skin of the one breake, and the
other ascend vpward to the hart, where it finisheth the naturall effect,
except the iuice of dragons (in Latine called "Dracunculus minor") be
spéedilie ministred and dronke in strong ale, or else some other
medicine taken of like force, that may counteruaile and ouercome the
venem of the same. The length of them is most commonlie two foot and
somwhat more, but seldome dooth it extend vnto two foot six inches,
<span class="leftnote">Snakes.</span>
except it be in some rare and monsterous one: whereas our snakes are
much longer, and séene sometimes to surmount a yard, or thrée foot,
although their poison be nothing so grieuous and deadlie as the others.
Our adders lie in winter vnder stones, as Aristotle also saith of the
viper Lib. 8. cap. 15. and in holes of the earth, rotten stubs of trees,
and amongst the dead leaues: but in the heat of the summer they come
abroad, and lie either round on heapes, or at length vpon some hillocke,
or elsewhere in the grasse. They are found onelie in our woodland
countries and highest grounds, where sometimes (though seldome) a
speckled stone called Echites, in Dutch "Ein atter stein," is gotten out
<span class="leftnote"><em>Sol. cap. 40. Plin. lib. 37. cap. 11.</em></span>
of their dried carcases, which diuers report to be good against their
poison. As for our snakes, which in Latine are properlie named "Angues,"
they commonlie are seene in moores, fens, lomie wals, and low bottoms.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Todes.<br />
Frogs.<br />
Sloworme.</span>
And as we haue great store of todes where adders commonlie are found, so
doo frogs abound where snakes doo kéepe their residence. We haue also
the sloworme, which is blacke and graiesh of colour, and somewhat
shorter than an adder. I was at the killing once of one of them, and
thereby perceiued that she was not so called of anie want of nimble
motion, but rather of the contrarie. Neuerthelesse we haue a blind worme
to be found vnder logs in woods, and timber that hath lien long in a
place, which some also doo call (and vpon better ground) by the name of
slow worms, and they are knowen easilie by their more or lesse varietie
of striped colours, drawen long waies from their heads, their whole
bodies little excéeding a foot in length, &amp; yet is there venem deadlie.
This also is not to be omitted, that now and then in our fennie
countries, other kinds of serpents are found of greater quantitie than
<span class="page"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>[Page 384]</span>
either our adder or our snake: but as these are not ordinarie and oft to
be séene, so I meane not to intreat of them among our common annoiances.
Neither haue we the scorpion, a plague of God sent not long since into
Italie, and whose poison (as Apollodorus saith) is white, neither the
tarantula or Neopolitane spider, whose poison bringeth death, except
musike be at hand. Wherfore I suppose our countrie to be the more happie
(I meane in part) for that it is void of these two grieuous annoiances,
wherewith other nations are plagued.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Efts.<br />
Swifts.</span>
We haue also efts, both of the land and water, and likewise the noisome
swifts, whereof to saie anie more it should be but losse of time, sith
they are well knowne; and no region to my knowledge found to be void of
<span class="rightnote">Flies.</span>
manie of them. As for flies (sith it shall not be amisse a little to
touch them also) we haue none that can doo hurt or hinderance naturallie
<span class="leftnote">Cutwasted.<br />
Whole bodied.<br />
Hornets.<br />
Waspes.</span>
vnto anie: for whether they be cut wasted, or whole bodied, they are
void of poison and all venemous inclination. The cut or girt wasted (for
so I English the word Insecta) are the hornets, waspes, bées, and such
like, whereof we haue great store, and of which an opinion is conceived,
that the first doo bréed of the corruption of dead horsses, the second
of peares and apples corrupted, and the last of kine and oxen: which may
be true, especiallie the first and latter in some parts of the beast,
and not their whole substances, as also in the second, sith we haue
neuer waspes, but when our fruit beginneth to wax ripe. In déed Virgil
and others speake of a generation of bées, by killing or smoothering of
a brused bullocke or calfe, and laieng his bowels or his flesh wrapped
vp in his hide in a close house for a certeine season; but how true it
is hitherto I haue not tried. Yet sure I am of this, that no one liuing
creature corrupteth without the production of another; as we may see by
our selues, whose flesh dooth alter into lice; and also in shéepe for
excessiue numbers of flesh flies, if they be suffered to lie vnburied or
vneaten by the dogs and swine, who often and happilie preuent such
néedlesse generations.</p>

<p>As concerning bées, I thinke it good to remember, that wheras some
ancient writers affirme it to be a commoditie wanting in our Iland, it
is now found to be nothing so. In old time peraduenture we had none in
déed, but in my daies there is such plentie of them in maner euerie
where, that in some vplandish townes, there are one hundred, or two
hundred hiues of them, although the said hiues are not so huge as those
of the east countrie, but far lesse, as not able to conteine aboue one
bushell of corne, or fiue pecks at the most. Plinie (a man that of set
purpose deliteth to write of woonders) speaking of honie noteth that in
the north regions the hiues in his time were of such quantitie, that
some one combe conteined eight foot in length, &amp; yet (as it should
séeme) he speketh not of the greatest. For in Podolia, which is now
subiect to the king of Poland, their hiues are so great, and combes so
abundant, that huge bores ouerturning and falling into them, are drowned
in the honie, before they can recouer &amp; find the meanes to come out.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Honie.</span>
Our honie also is taken and reputed to be the best, bicause it is
harder, better wrought, and clenlier vesselled vp, than that which
commeth from beyond the sea, where they stampe and streine their combs,
bées, and yoong blowings altogither into the stuffe, as I haue béene
informed. In vse also of medicine our physicians and apothecaries eschew
the forren, especiallie that of Spaine and Ponthus, by reason of a
venemous qualitie naturallie planted in the same, as some write, and
choose the home made: not onelie by reason of our soile, which hath no
lesse plentie of wild thime growing therein than in Sicilia, &amp; about
Athens, and makth the best stuffe; as also for that it bréedeth (being
gotten in haruest time) lesse choler, and which is oftentimes (as I haue
séene by experience) so white as sugar, and corned as if it were salt.
Our hiues are made commonlie of rie straw, and wadled about with bramble
quarters: but some make the same of wicker, and cast them ouer with
claie. Wée cherish none in trées, but set our hiues somewhere on the
warmest side of the house, prouiding that they may stand drie and
without danger both of the mouse and moth. This furthermore is to be
noted, that wheras in vessels of oile, that which is néerest the top is
counted the finest, and of wine that in the middest; so of honie the
best which is heauiest and moistest is alwaies next the bottome, and
<span class="page"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>[Page 385]</span>
euermore casteth and driueth his dregs vpward toward the verie top,
contrarie to the nature of other liquid substances, whose groonds and
léeze doo generallie settle downewards. And thus much as by the waie of
our bées and English honie.</p>

<p>As for the whole bodied, as the cantharides, and such venemous creatures
of the same kind, to be abundantlie found in other countries, we heare
not of them: yet haue we béetles, horseflies, turdbugs or borres (called
in Latine <em>Scarabei</em>) the locust or the grashopper (which to me doo
séeme to be one thing, as I will anon declare) and such like, whereof
let other intreat that make an exercise in catching of flies, but a far
greater sport in offering them to spiders. As did Domitian sometime, and
an other prince yet liuing, who delited so much to sée the iollie
combats betwixt a stout flie and an old spider, that diuerse men haue
had great rewards giuen them for their painfull prouision of flies made
onelie for this purpose. Some parasites also in the time of the
aforesaid emperour, (when they were disposed to laugh at his follie, and
yet would seeme in appearance to gratifie his fantasticall head with
some shew of dutifull demenour) could deuise to set their lord on worke,
by letting a flesh flie priuilie into his chamber, which he foorthwith
would egerlie haue hunted (all other businesse set apart) and neuer
ceased till he had caught hir into his fingers: wherevpon arose the
prouerbe, "Ne musca quidem," vttered first by Vibius Priscus, who being
asked whether anie bodie was with Domitian, answered, "Ne musca quidem,"
wherby he noted his follie. There are some cockescombs here and there in
England, learning it abroad as men transregionate, which make account
also of this pastime, as of a notable matter, telling what a fight is
séene betwene them, if either of them be lustie and couragious in his
kind. One also hath made a booke of the spider and the flie, wherein he
dealeth so profoundlie, and beyond all measure of skill, that neither he
himselfe that made it, neither anie one that readeth it, can reach vnto
the meaning therof. But if those iollie fellows in stéed of the straw
that they thrust into the flies tale (a great iniurie no doubt to such a
noble champion) would bestow the cost to set a fooles cap vpon their
owne heads: then might they with more securitie and lesse reprehension
behold these notable battels.</p>
<p>
Now as concerning the locust, I am led by diuerse of my countrie, who
(as they say) were either in Germanie, Italie, or Pannonia, 1542, when
those nations were greatly annoied with that kind of flie, and affirme
verie constantlie, that they saw none other creature than the
grashopper, during the time of that annoiance, which was said to come to
them from the Meotides. In most of our translations also of the bible,
the word <em>Locusta</em> is Englished a grashopper, and therevnto Leuit. 11.
it is reputed among the cleane food, otherwise Iohn the Baptist would
<span class="leftnote">Sée <em>Diodorus Sicutus</em>.</span>
neuer haue liued with them in the wildernesse. In Barbarie, Numidia, and
sundrie other places of Affrica, as they haue beene, so are they eaten
to this daie powdred in barels, and therefore the people of those parts
are called <em>Acedophagi:</em> neuertheles they shorten the life of the eaters
by the production at the last of an irkesome and filthie disease. In
India they are thrée foot long, in Ethiopia much shorter, but in England
seldome aboue an inch. As for the cricket called in Latin <em>Cicada</em>, he
hath some likelihood, but not verie great, with the grashopper, and
therefore he is not to be brought in as an vmpier in this case. Finallie
Matthiolus, and so manie as describe the locust, doo set downe none
other forme than that of our grashopper, which maketh me so much the
more to rest vpon my former imagination, which is, that the locust and
grashopper are one.</p>

<small>OF OUR ENGLISH DOGS AND THEIR QUALITIES.</small><br />

CHAP. VII.</h3>

<p>There is no countrie that maie (as I take it) compare with ours, in
number, excellencie, and diuersite of dogs. And therefore if Polycrates
of Samia were now aliue, he would not send to Epyro for such
merchandize: but to his further cost prouide them out of Britaine, as an
ornament to his countrie, and péece of husbandrie for his common wealth,
which he furnished of set purpose with Molossian and Lacaonian dogs, as
he did the same also with shéepe out of Attica and Miletum, gotes from
Scyro and Naxus, swine out of Sicilia, and artificers out of other
places. Howbeit the learned doctor Caius in his Latine treatise vnto
Gesner "De canibus Anglicis," bringeth them all into thrée sorts: that
is, the gentle kind seruing for game: the homelie kind apt for sundrie
vses: and the currish kind méet for many toies. For my part I can say no
more of them than he hath doone alredie. Wherefore I will here set downe
onelie a summe of that which he hath written of their names and natures,
with the addition of an example or two now latelie had in experience,
whereby the courages of our mastiffes shall yet more largelie appeare.
As for those of other countries I haue not to deale with them: neither
care I to report out of Plinie, that dogs were sometime killed in
sacrifice, and sometime their whelps eaten as a delicate dish, Lib. 29.
cap. 4. Wherefore if anie man be disposed to read of them, let him
resort to Plinie lib. 8. cap. 40. who (among other woonders) telleth of
an armie of two hundred dogs, which fetched a king of the Garamantes out
of captiuitie, mawgre the resistance of his aduersaries: also to Cardan,
lib. 10. "De animalibus," Aristotle, &amp;c: who write maruels of them, but
none further from credit than Cardan, who is not afraid to compare some
of them for greatnesse with oxen, and some also for smalnesse vnto the
little field mouse. Neither doo I find anie far writer of great
antiquitie, that maketh mention of our dogs, Strabo excepted, who saith
that the Galles did somtime buy vp all our mastiffes, to serue in the
forewards of their battels, wherein they resembled the Colophonians,
Castabalenses of Calicute and Phenicia, of whom Plinie also speaketh,
but they had them not from vs.</p>

<p>The first sort therefore he diuideth either into such as rowse
the beast, and continue the chase, or springeth the bird, and
bewraieth hir flight by pursute. And as these are commonlie called
spaniels, so the other are named hounds, whereof he maketh eight
sorts, of which the formost excelleth in perfect smelling, the
second in quicke espieng, the third in swiftnesse and quickenesse,
the fourth in smelling and nimblenesse, &amp;c: and the last in
subtiltie and deceitfulnesse. These (saith Strabo) are most apt for
game, and called <em>Sagaces</em> by a generall name, not onelie
bicause of their skill in hunting, but also for that they know
their owne and the names of their fellowes most exactlie. For if
the hunter see anie one to follow skilfullie, and with likelihood
of good successe, he biddeth the rest to harke and follow such a
dog, and they eftsoones obeie so soone as they heare his name. The
first kind of these are also commonlie called hariers, whose game
is the fox, the hare, the woolfe (if we had anie) hart, bucke,
badger, otter, polcat, lopstart, wesell, conie, &amp;c: the second
hight a terrer, and it hunteth the badger and graie onelie: the
third a bloudhound, whose office is to follow the fierce, and now
and then to pursue a th&eacute;efe or beast by his drie foot: the
fourth hight a gasehound, who hunteth by the eie: the fift a
greihound, cherished for his strength, swiftnes, and stature,
commended by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Bratius De venatione, 1/386 - probably Faliscus Gratius, De venatione, 1534.'">Bratius</ins> in his "De venatione," and not
vnremembred by Hercules Stroza in a like treatise, but aboue all
other those of Britaine, where he saith:</p>

<p class="ind1">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; &amp; magna spectandi mole Britanni,</p>

<p>also by Nemesianus, libro Cynegeticôn, where he saith:</p>

<p class="ind1">Diuisa Britannia mittit<br />
Veloces nostríq; orbis venatibus aptos,</p>

<p><span class="page"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>[Page 387]</span></p>
<p>of which sort also some be smooth, of sundrie colours, and some shake
haired: the sixt a liemer, that excelleth in smelling and swift running:
the seuenth a tumbler: and the eight a théefe, whose offices (I meane of
the latter two) incline onelie to deceit, wherein they are oft so
skilfull, that few men would thinke so mischiefous a wit to remaine in
such sillie creatures. Hauing made this enumeration of dogs, which are
apt for the chase and hunting, he commeth next to such as serue the
falcons in their times, whereof he maketh also two sorts. One that
findeth his game on the land, an other that putteth vp such foule as
keepeth in the water: and of these this is commonlie most vsuall for the
net or traine, the other for the hawke, as he dooth shew at large. Of
the first he saith, that they haue no peculiar names assigned to them
seuerallie, but each of them is called after the bird which by naturall
appointment he is allotted to hunt or serue, for which consideration
some be named dogs for the feasant, some for the falcon, and some for
the partrich. Howbeit the common name for all is spaniell (saith he) and
therevpon alludeth, as if these kinds of dogs had bin brought hither out
of Spaine. In like sort we haue of water spaniels in their kind. The
third sort of dogs of the gentle kind, is the spaniell gentle, or
comforter, or (as the common terme is) the fistinghound, and those are
called <em>Melitei</em>, of the Iland Malta, from whence they were brought
hither. These are little and prettie, proper and fine, and sought out
far and néere to satisfie the nice delicacie of daintie dames, and
wanton womens willes; instruments of follie to plaie and dallie withall,
in trifling away the treasure of time, to withdraw their minds from more
commendable exercises, and to content their corrupt concupiscences with
vaine disport, a sillie poore shift to shun their irkesome idlenes.
These Sybariticall puppies, the smaller they be (and thereto if they
haue an hole in the foreparts of their heads) the better they are
accepted, the more pleasure also they prouoke, as méet plaiefellowes for
minsing mistresses to beare in their bosoms, to keepe companie withall
in their chambers, to succour with sléepe in bed, and nourish with meat
at boord, to lie in their laps, and licke their lips as they lie (like
yoong Dianaes) in their wagons and coches. And good reason it should be
so, for coursenesse with finenesse hath no fellowship, but featnesse
with neatnesse hath neighbourhead inough. That plausible prouerbe
therefore verefied sometime vpon a tyrant, namelie that he loued his sow
better than his sonne, may well be applied to some of this kind of
people, who delight more in their dogs, that are depriued of all
possibilitie of reason, than they doo in children that are capable of
wisedome &amp; iudgement. Yea, they oft féed them of the best, where the
poore mans child at their doores can hardlie come by the woorst. But the
former abuse peraduenture reigneth where there hath béene long want of
issue, else where barrennesse is the best blossome of beautie: or
finallie, where poore mens children for want of their owne issue are not
readie to be had. It is thought of some that it is verie wholesome for a
weake stomach to beare such a dog in the bosome, as it is for him that
hath the palsie to féele the dailie smell and sauour of a fox. But how
truelie this is affirmed let the learned iudge: onelie it shall suffice
for Doctor Caius to haue said thus much of spaniels and dogs of the
gentle kind.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Homelie kind of dogs.</span>
Dogs of the homelie kind, are either shepheards curs, or mastiffes. The
first are so common, that it néedeth me not to speake of them. Their vse
also is so well knowne in keeping the heard togither (either when they
grase or go before the sheepheard) that it should be but in vaine to
spend anie time about them. Wherefore I will leaue this curre vnto his
<span class="leftnote">Tie dogs.</span>
owne kind, and go in hand with the mastiffe, tie dog, or banddog, so
called bicause manie of them are tied vp in chaines and strong bonds, in
the daie time, for dooing hurt abroad, which is an huge dog, stubborne,
ouglie, eager, burthenous of bodie (&amp; therefore but of little
swiftnesse) terrible and fearfull to behold, and oftentimes more fierce
and fell than anie Archadian or Corsican cur. Our Englishmen to the
intent that these dogs may be more cruell and fierce, assist nature with
some art, vse and custome. For although this kind of dog be capable of
courage, violent, valiant, stout and bold: yet will they increase these
their stomachs by teaching them to bait the beare, the bull, the lion,
and other such like cruell and bloudie beasts, (either brought ouer or
kept vp at home, for the same purpose) without anie collar to defend
<span class="page"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>[Page 388]</span>
their throats, and oftentimes thereto they traine them vp in fighting
and wrestling with a man (hauing for the safegard of his life either a
pike staffe, club, sword, priuie coate) wherby they become the more
fierce and cruell vnto strangers. The Caspians made so much account
sometime of such great dogs, that euerie able man would nourish sundrie
of them in his house of set purpose, to the end they should deuoure
their carcases after their deaths, thinking the dogs bellies to be the
most honourable sepulchers. The common people also followed the same
rate, and therfore there were tie dogs kept vp by publike ordinance, to
deuoure them after their deaths: by means whereof these beasts became
the more eger, and with great difficultie after a while restreined from
falling vpon the liuing. But whither am I digressed? In returning
<span class="leftnote">Some barke and bite not.<br />
Some bite and barke not.</span>
therefore to our owne, I saie that of mastiffes, some barke onelie with
fierce and open mouth but will not bite, some doo both barke and bite,
but the cruellest doo either not barke at all, or bite before they
barke, and therefore are more to be feared than anie of the other. They
take also their name of the word mase and théefe (or master théefe if
you will) bicause they often stound and put such persons to their shifts
in townes and villages, and are the principall causes of their
apprehension and taking. The force which is in them surmounteth all
beleefe, and the fast hold which they take with their téeth excéedeth
all credit: for thrée of them against a beare, foure against a lion, are
sufficient to trie mastries with them. King Henrie the seauenth, as the
report goeth, commanded all such curres to be hanged, bicause they durst
presume to fight against the lion, who is their king and souereigne. The
like he did with an excellent falcon, as some saie, bicause he feared
not hand to hand to match with an eagle, willing his falconers in his
owne presence to pluck off his head after he was taken downe, saieng
that it was not méet for anie subiect to offer such wrong vnto his lord
and superiour, wherein he had a further meaning. But if king Henrie the
seauenth had liued in our time, what would he haue doone to one English
mastiffe, which alone and without anie helpe at all pulled downe first
an huge beare, then a pard, and last of all a lion, each after other
before the French king in one daie, when the lord Buckhurst was
ambassador vnto him, and whereof if I should write the circumstances,
that is, how he tooke his aduantage being let lose vnto them, and
finallie draue them into such excéeding feare, that they were all glad
to run awaie when he was taken from them, I should take much paines, and
yet reape but small credit: wherefore it shall suffice to haue said thus
much thereof. Some of our mastiffes will rage onelie in the night, some
are to be tied vp both daie and night. Such also as are suffered to go
lose about the house and yard, are so gentle in the daie time, that
children may ride on their backs, &amp; plaie with them, at their pleasures.
Diuerse of them likewise are of such gelousie ouer their maister and
whosoeuer of his houshold, that if a stranger doo imbrace or touch anie
of them, they will fall fiercelie vpon them, vnto their extreame
mischéefe if their furie be not preuented. Such an one was the dog of
Nichomedes king sometime of Bithinia, who séeing Consigne the quéene to
imbrace and kisse hir husband as they walked togither in a garden, did
teare hir all to peeces, mauger his resistance, and the present aid of
such as attended on them. Some of them moreouer will suffer a stranger
to come in and walke about the house or yard where him listeth, without
giuing ouer to follow him: but if he put foorth his hand to touch anie
thing, then will they flie vpon him and kill him if they may. I had one
my selfe once, which would not suffer anie man to bring in his weapon
further than my gate: neither those that were of my house to be touched
in his presence. Or if I had beaten anie of my children, he would
gentlie haue assaied to catch the rod in his teeth and take it out of my
hand, or else pluck downe their clothes to saue them from the stripes:
which in my opinion is not vnworthie to be noted. And thus much of our
mastiffes, creatures of no lesse faith and loue towards their maisters
than horsses; as may appeare euen by the confidence that Masinissa
reposed in them, in so much that mistrusting his houshold seruants he
made him a gard of dogs, which manie a time deliuered him from their
treasons and conspiracies, euen by their barking and biting, nor of
lesse force than the Molossian race, brought from Epiro into some
countries, which the poets feigne to haue originall from the brasen dog
<span class="page"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>[Page 389]</span>
that Vulcan made, and gaue to Iupiter, who also deliuered the same to
Europa, she to Procris, and Procris to Cephalus, as Iulius Pollux
noteth, lib. 5. cap. 5: neither vnequall in carefulnesse to the mastiffe
of Alexander Phereus, who by his onelie courage and attendance kept his
maister long time from slaughter, till at the last he was remooued by
policie, and the tyrant killed sléeping: the storie goeth thus. Thebe
the wife of the said Phereus and hir three brethren conspired the death
of hir husband, who fearing the dog onelie, she found the means to
allure him from his chamber doore by faire means, vnto another house
hard by, whilest they should execute their purpose. Neuerthelesse, when
they came to the bed where he laie sléeping, they waxed faint harted,
till she did put them in choise, either that they should dispatch him at
once, or else that she hir selfe would wake hir husband, and giue him
warning of his enimies, or at the least wise bring in the dog vpon them,
which they feared most of all: and therefore quicklie dispatched him.</p>
<p>
The last sort of dogs consisteth of the currish kind méet for manie
toies: of which the whappet or prickeard curre is one. Some men call
them warners, bicause they are good for nothing else but to barke and
giue warning when anie bodie dooth stirre or lie in wait about the house
in the night season. Certes it is vnpossible to describe these curs in
anie order, bicause they haue no anie one kind proper vnto themselues,
but are a confused companie mixt of all the rest. The second sort of
them are called turne spits, whose office is not vnknowne to anie. And
as these are onelie reserued for this purpose, so in manie places our
mastiffes (beside the vse which tinkers haue of them in carieng their
heauie budgets) are made to draw water in great whéeles out of déepe
wels, going much like vnto those which are framed for our turne spits,
as is to be séene at Roiston, where this feat is often practised.
Besides these also we haue sholts or curs dailie brought out of Iseland,
and much made of among vs, bicause of their sawcinesse and quarrelling.
Moreouer they bite verie sore, and loue candles excéedinglie, as doo the
men and women of their countrie: but I may saie no more of them, bicause
they are not bred with vs. Yet this will I make report of by the waie,
for pastimes sake, that when a great man of those parts came of late
into one of our ships which went thither for fish, to see the forme and
fashion of the same, his wife apparrelled in fine sables, abiding on the
decke whilest hir husband was vnder the hatches with the mariners,
espied a pound or two of candles hanging at the mast, and being loth to
stand there idle alone, she fell to and eat them vp euerie one,
supposing hir selfe to haue béene at a iollie banket, and shewing verie
plesant gesture when hir husband came vp againe vnto hir.</p>
<p>
The last kind of toiesh curs are named dansers, and those being of a
mongrell sort also, are taught &amp; exercised to danse in measure at the
musicall sound of an instrument, as at the iust stroke of a drum, sweet
accent of the citharne, and pleasant harmonie of the harpe, shewing
manie trickes by the gesture of their bodies: as to stand bolt vpright,
to lie flat vpon the ground, to turne round as a ring, holding their
tailes in their teeth, to saw and beg for meat, to take a mans cap from
his head, and sundrie such properties, which they learne of their idle
rogish masters whose instruments they are to gather gaine, as old apes
clothed in motleie, and coloured short wasted iackets are for the like
vagabunds, who séeke no better liuing, than that which they may get by
fond pastime and idlenesse. I might here intreat of other dogs, as of
those which are bred betwéene a bitch and a woolfe, and called
<em>Lycisca</em>: a thing verie often séene in France saith Franciscus
Patricius in his common wealth, as procured of set purpose, and learned
as I thinke of the Indians, who tie their sault bitches often in woods,
that they might be loined by tigers: also betweene a bitch and a fox, or
a beare and a mastiffe. But as we vtterlie want the first sort, except
they be brought vnto vs: so it happeneth sometime, that the other two
are ingendered and seene at home amongst vs. But all the rest heretofore
remembred in this chapter, there is none more ouglie and odious in
sight, cruell and fierce in déed, nor vntractable in hand, than that
which is begotten betwéene the beare and the bandog. For whatsoeuer he
catcheth hold of, he taketh it so fast, that a man may sooner teare and
rend his bodie in sunder, than get open his mouth to separate his chaps.
Certes he regardeth neither woolfe, beare, nor lion, and therfore may
<span class="page"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>[Page 390]</span>
well be compared with those two dogs which were sent to Alexander out of
India (&amp; procreated as it is thought betwéene a mastiffe and male tiger,
as be those also of Hircania) or to them that are bred in Archadia,
where copulation is oft seene betweene lions and bitches, as the like is
in France (as I said) betwéene shée woolfes and dogs, whereof let this
suffice; sith the further tractation of them dooth not concerne my
purpose, more than the confutation of Cardans talke, "De subt." lib. 10.
who saith, that after manie generations, dogs doo become woolfes, and
contrariwise; which if it were true, than could not England be without
manie woolfes: but nature hath set a difference betwéene them, not
onelie in outward forme, but also in inward disposition of their bones,
wherefore it is vnpossible that his assertion can be sound.</p>

<p>As the saffron of England, which Platina reckneth among spices, is the
most excellent of all other: for it giueth place neither to that of
Cilicia, whereof Solinus speaketh, neither to anie that commeth from
Cilicia, where it groweth vpon the mount Taurus, Tmolus, Italie, Ætolia,
Sicilia or Licia, in swéetnesse, tincture, and continuance; so of that
which is to be had amongst vs, the same that grows about Saffron Walden,
somtime called Waldenburg, in the edge of Essex, first of all planted
there in the time of Edward the third, and that of Glocester shire and
those westerlie parts, which some thinke to be better than that of
Walden, surmounteth all the rest, and therefore beareth worthilie the
higher price, by six pence or twelue pence most commonlie in the pound.
The root of the herbe that beareth this commoditie is round, much like
vnto an indifferent chestnut, &amp; yet it is not cloued as the lillie, nor
flaked as the scallion, but hath a sad substance "Inter bulbosa," as
Orchis, hyacinthus orientalis, and Statyrion. The colour of the rind is
not much differing from the innermost shell of a chestnut, although it
be not altogither so brickle as is the pill of an onion. So long as the
leafe flourisheth the root is litle &amp; small; but when the grasse is
withered, the head increaseth and multiplieth, the fillets also or small
roots die, so that when the time dooth come to take them vp, they haue
no roots at all, but so continue vntill September that they doo grow
againe: and before the chiue be grounded the smallest heads are also
most esteemed; but whether they be great or small, if sheepe or neat may
come to them on the heape, as they lie in the field, they will deuoure
them as if they were haie or stuble, some also will wroot for them in
verie eager maner. The leafe or rather the blade thereof is long and
narrow as grasse, which come vp alwaies in October after the floures be
gathered and gone, pointed on a little tuft much like vnto our siues.
Sometimes our cattell will féed vpon the same; neuerthelesse, if it be
bitten whilest it is gréene, the head dieth, and therefore our crokers
are carefull to kéepe it from such annoiance vntill it begin to wither,
and then also will the cattell soonest tast thereof: for vntill that
time the iuice thereof is bitter. In euerie floure we find commonlie
thrée chiues, and three yellowes, and double the number of leaues. Of
twisted floures I speake not; yet is it found, that two floures grow
togither, which bring foorth fiue chiues, so that alwaies there is an od
chiue and od yellow, though thrée or foure floures should come out of
one root. The whole herbe is named in Gréeke <em>Crocos</em>, but of some (as
Dioscorides saith) <em>Castor</em>, <em>Cynomorphos</em>, or Hercules blood: yet in the
<span class="leftnote">Occasion of the name.</span>
Arabian spéech, (from whence we borow the name which we giue thervnto) I
find that it is called <em>Zahafaran</em>, as Rembert dooth beare witnesse. The
cause wherefore it was called Crocus was this (as the poets feigne)
speciallie those from whome Galen hath borowed the historie, which he
noteth in his ninth booke "De medicamentis secundum loca," where he
writeth after this maner (although I take Crocus to be the first that
vsed this comoditie.) A certeine yong gentleman called Crocus went to
plaie at coits in the field with Mercurie, and being héedlesse of
himselfe, Mercuries coit happened by mishap to hit him on the head,
<span class="page"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>[Page 391]</span>
whereby he receiued a wound that yer long killed him altogither, to the
great discomfort of his freends. Finallie, in the place where he bled,
saffron was after found to grow, wherevpon the people seeing the colour
of the chiue as it stood (although I doubt not but it grew there long
before) adiudged it to come of the blood of Crocus, and therefore they
gaue it his name. And thus farre Rembert, who with Galen, &amp;c: differ
verie much from Ouids Metamorphos. 4. who writeth also thereof. Indéed
the chiue, while it remaineth whole &amp; vnbrused, resembleth a darke red,
but being broken and conuerted into vse, it yéeldeth a yellow tincture.
But what haue we to doo with fables?</p>

<p>The heads of saffron are raised in Iulie, either with plough, raising,
or tined hooke; and being scowred from their rosse or filth, and seuered
from such heads as are ingendred of them, since the last setting, they
are interred againe in Iulie and August by ranks or rowes, and being
couered with moulds, they rest in the earth, where they cast forth litle
fillets and small roots like vnto a scallion, vntill September, in the
<span class="leftnote">Paring.</span>
beginning of which moneth the ground is pared, and all wéeds and grasse
that groweth vpon the same remooued, to the intent that nothing may
annoie the floure when as his time dooth come to rise.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Gathering.</span>
These things being thus ordered in the latter end of the aforesaid
moneth of September, the floure beginneth to appeere of a whitish blew,
fesse or skie colour, and in the end shewing
<span class="leftnote">Sée <em>Rembert</em>.</span>
it selfe in the owne kind, it resembleth almost the Leucotion of
Theophrast, sauing that it is longer, and hath in the middest thereof
thrée chiues verie red and pleasant to behold. These floures are
gathered in the morning before the rising of the sunne, which otherwise
would cause them to welke or flitter. And the chiues being picked from
the floures, these are throwne into the doonghill; the other dried vpon
little kelles couered with streined canuasses vpon a soft fire: wherby,
and by the weight that is laied vpon them, they are dried and pressed
into cakes, and then bagged vp for the benefit of their owners. In good
yeeres we gather foure score or an hundred pounds of wet saffron of an
acre, which being dried dooth yeeld twentie pounds of drie and more.
Whereby, and sith the price of saffron is commonlie about twentie
shillings in monie, or not so little, it is easie to sée what benefit is
reaped by an acre of this commoditie, towards the charges of the setter,
which indeed are great, but yet not so much, as he shall be thereby a
looser, if he be anie thing diligent. For admit that the triple tillage
of an acre dooth cost 13 shillings foure pence before the saffron be
set, the clodding sixtéene pence, the taking of euerie load of stones
from the same foure pence, the raising of euerie quarter of heads six
pence, and so much for clensing of them, besides the rent of ten
shillings for euerie acre, thirtie load of doong which is woorth six
pence the load to be laid on the first yéere, for the setting three and
twentie shillings and foure pence, for the paring fiue shillings, six
pence for the picking of a pound wet, &amp;c: yea though he hire it readie
set, and paie ten pounds for the same, yet shall he susteine no damage,
if warme weather and open season doo happen at the gathering. This also
is to be noted, that euerie acre asketh twentie quarters of heads,
placed in ranks two inches one from an other in long beds, which
conteine eight or ten foot in breadth. And after thrée yeeres that
ground will serue well, and without compest for barleie by the space of
eightéene or twentie yéeres togither, as experience dooth confirme. The
heads also of euerie acre at the raising will store an acre and an halfe
of new ground, which is a great aduantage, and it will floure eight or
ten daies togither. But the best saffron is gathered at the first; at
which time foure pounds of wet saffron will go verie neere to make one
of drie; but in the middest fiue pounds of the one will make but one of
the other, because the chiue waxeth smaller, as six at the last will doo
no more but yéeld one of the dried, by reason of the chiue which is now
verie leane and hungrie. After twentie yeeres also the same ground may
be set with saffron againe. And in lieu of a conclusion, take this for a
perpetuall rule, that heads comming out of a good ground will prosper
best in a lighter soile; and contrariwise: which is one note that our
crokers doo carefullie obserue.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Raising.</span>
The heads are raised euerie third yeare about vs, to wit, after
Midsummer, when the rosse commeth drie from the heads; and commonlie in
the first yéere after they be set they yéeld verie little increase: yet
that which then commeth is counted the finest and greatest chiue, &amp;
<span class="page"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>[Page 392]</span>
best for medicine, and called saffron Du hort. The next crop is much
greater; but the third exceedeth, and then they raise againe about
Walden and in Cambridge shire. In this period of time also the heads are
said to child, that is, to yéeld out of some parts of them diuerse other
headlets, whereby it hath béene séene, that some one head hath béene
increased (though with his owne detriment) to three, or foure, or fiue,
or six, which augmentation is the onlie cause wherby they are sold so
good cheape. For to my remembrance I haue not knowne foure bushels or a
coome of them to be valued much aboue two shillings eight pence, except
in some od yéeres that they arise to eight or ten shillings the quarter,
and that is when ouer great store of winters water hath rotted the most
of them as they stood within the ground, or heat in summer parched and
burnt them vp.</p>

<p>In Norffolke and Suffolke they raise but once in seuen yéeres: but as
their saffron is not so fine as that of Cambridgeshire and about Walden,
so it will not cake, ting, nor hold colour withall, wherein lieth a
great part of the value of this stuffe. Some craftie iackes vse to mix
it with scraped brazell or with the floure of Sonchus, which commeth
somewhat neere indeed to the hue of our good saffron (if it be late
gathered) but it is soone bewraied both by the depth of the colour and
hardnesse. Such also was the plentie of saffron about twentie yeeres
passed, that some of the townesmen of Walden gaue the one halfe of the
floures for picking of the other, and sent them ten or twelue miles
abroad into the countrie, whilest the rest, not thankfull for the
abundance of Gods blessing bestowed vpon them (as wishing rather more
scarsitie thereof because of the kéeping vp of the price) in most
contemptuous maner murmured against him, saieng that he did shite
saffron therewith to choake the market. But as they shewed themselues no
lesse than ingrat infidels in this behalfe, so the Lord considered their
vnthankfulnesse, &amp; gaue them euer since such scarsitie, as the greatest
murmurers haue now the least store; and most of them are either worne
out of occupieng, or remaine scarse able to mainteine their grounds
without the helpe of other men. Certes it hath generallie decaied about
Saffron Walden since the said time, vntill now of late within these two
yeares, that men began againe to plant and renew the same, because of
the great commoditie. But to procéed. When the heads be raised and taken
vp, they will remaine sixteene or twentie daies out of the earth or
more: yea peraduenture a full moneth. Howbeit they are commonlie in the
earth againe by saint Iames tide, or verie shortlie after. For as if
they be taken vp before Midsummer, or beginning of Iulie, the heads will
shrinke like a rosted warden: so after August they will wax drie, become
vnfruitfull, and decaie. And I know it by experience, in that I haue
carried some of them to London with me; and notwithstanding that they
haue remained there vnset by the space of fortie dais and more: yet some
of them haue brought foorth two or thrée floures a peece, and some
floures thrée or fiue chiues, to the greeat admiration of such as haue
gathered the same, and not béene acquainted with their nature and
countrie where they grew. The crokers or saffron men doo vse an
obseruation a litle before the comming vp of the floure, and sometime in
the taking vp at Midsummer tide, by opening of the heads to iudge of
plentie and scarsitie of this commoditie to come. For if they sée as it
were manie small hairie veines of saffron to be in the middest of the
bulbe, they pronounce a fruitfull yeare. And to saie truth, at the
cleauing of ech head, a man shall discerne the saffron by the colour,
and sée where abouts the chiue will issue out of the root. Warme darke
nights, swéet dews, fat grounds (chéeflie the chalkie) and mistie
mornings are verie good for saffron; but frost and cold doo kill and
keepe backe the floure, or else shrinke vp the chiue. And thus much haue
I thought good to speake of English saffron, which is hot in the second
and drie in the first degrée, and most plentifull as our crokers hold,
in that yéere wherein ewes twin most. But as I can make no warrantize
hereof, so I am otherwise sure, that there is no more deceit vsed in
anie trade than in saffron. For in the making they will grease the
papers on the kell with a little candle grease, to make the woorst
saffron haue so good a colour as the best: afterwards also they will
sprinkle butter thereon to make the weight better. But both these are
bewraied, either by a quantitie thereof holden ouer the fire in a siluer
spoone, or by the softnesse thereof betwéene the fore finger and
<span class="page"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>[Page 393]</span>
the thumbe; or thirdlie, by the colour thereof in age: for if you laie
it by farre worse saffron of other countries, the colour will bewraie
the forgerie by the swartnesse of the chiue, which otherwise would
excell it, and therevnto being sound, remaine crispe, brickle, and drie:
and finallie, if it be holden néere the face, will strike a certeine
biting heat vpon the skin and eies, whereby it is adiudged good and
merchant ware indéed among the skilfull crokers.</p>

<p>Now if it please you to heare of anie of the vertues thereof, I will
note these insuing at the request of one, who required me to touch a few
of them with whatsoeuer breuitie I listed. Therefore our saffron (beside
the manifold vse that it hath in the kitchin and pastrie, also in our
cakes at bridals, and thanksgiuings of women) is verie profitably
mingled with those medicins which we take for the diseases of the
breast, of the lungs, of the liuer, and of the bladder: it is good also
for the stomach if you take it in meat, for it comforteth the same and
maketh good digestion: being sodden also in wine, it not onelie kéepeth
a man from droonkennesse, but incorageth also vnto procreation of issue.
If you drinke it in sweet wine, it inlargeth the breath, and is good for
those that are troubled with the tisike and shortnesse of the wind:
mingled with the milke of a woman, and laied vpon the eies, it staieth
such humors as descend into the same, and taketh awaie the red wheales
and pearles that oft grow about them: it killeth moths if it be sowed in
paper bags verie thin, and laid vp in presses amongst tapistrie or
apparell: also it is verie profitablie laid vnto all inflammations,
painefull aposthumes, and the shingles; and dooth no small ease vnto
deafnes, if it be mingled with such medicins as are beneficiall vnto the
eares: it is of great vse also in ripening of botches and all swellings
procéeding of raw humors. Or if it shall please you to drinke the root
thereof with maluesie, it will maruellouslie prouoke vrine, dissolue and
expell grauell, and yéeld no small ease to them that make their water by
dropmeales. Finallie, thrée drams thereof taken at once, which is about
the weight of one shilling nine pence halfepenie, is deadlie poison; as
Dioscorides dooth affirme: and droonke in wine (saith Platina) lib. 3.
cap. 13. "De honesta voluptate," dooth hast on droonkennesse, which is
verie true. And I haue knowne some, that by eating onelie of bread more
than of custome streined with saffron, haue become like droonken men, &amp;
yet otherwise well known to be but competent drinkers. For further
confirmation of this also, if a man doo but open and ransake a bag of
one hundred or two hundred weight, as merchants doo when they buie it of
the crokers, it will strike such an aire into their heads which deale
withall, that for a time they shall be giddie and sicke (I meane for two
or three houres space) their noses and eies in like sort will yéeld such
plentie of rheumatike water, that they shall be the better for it long
after, especiallie their eiesight, which is woonderfullie clarified by
this meanes: howbeit some merchants not liking of this physike, muffle
themselues as women doo when they ride, and put on spectacles set in
leather, which dooth in some measure (but not for altogither) put by the
force thereof. There groweth some saffron in manie places of Almaine,
and also about Vienna in Austria, which later is taken for the best that
springeth in those quarters. In steed of this some doo vse the
Carthamus, called amongst vs bastard saffron, but neither is this of
anie value, nor the other in any wise comparable vnto ours. Whereof let
this suffice as of a commoditie brought into this Iland in the time of
Edward 3. and not commonlie planted till Richard 2. did reigne. It would
grow verie well (as I take it) about the Chiltern hils, &amp; in all the
vale of the White horsse so well as in Walden and Cambridgeshire, if
they were carefull of it. I heare of some also to be cherished alreadie
in Glocestershire, and certeine other places westward. But of the
finenesse and tincture of the chiue, I heare not as yet of anie triall.
Would to God that my countriemen had beene heretofore (or were now) more
carefull of this commoditie! then would it no doubt haue prooued more
beneficiall to our Iland than our cloth or wooll. But alas! so idle are
we, and heretofore so much giuen to ease, by reason of the smalnesse of
our rents, that few men regard to search out which are their best
commodities. But if landlords hold on to raise the rents of their farms
as they begin, they will inforce their tenants to looke better vnto
their gains, and scratch out their rent from vnder euerie clod that may
<span class="page"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>[Page 394]</span>
be turned aside. The greatest mart for saffron is at Aquila in Abruzo,
where they haue an especiall weight for the same of ten pounds lesse in
the hundred than that of Florens and Luke: but how it agréeth with ours
it shall appéere hereafter.</p>

<small>OF QUARRIES OF STONE FOR BUILDING.</small><br />

CHAP. IX.</h3>

<p>Quarries with vs are pits or mines, out of which we dig our stone to
build withall, &amp; of these as we haue great plentie in England, so are
they of diuerse sorts, and those verie profitable for sundrie necessarie
vses. In times past the vse of stone was in maner dedicated to the
building of churches, religious houses, princely palaces, bishops
manours, and holds onlie: but now that scrupulous obseruation is
altogither infringed, and building with stone so commonlie taken vp,
that amongst noble men &amp; gentlemen, the timber frames are supposed to be
not much better than paper worke, of little continuance, and least
continuance of all. It farre passeth my cunning to set downe how manie
sorts of stone for building are to be found in England, but much further
to call each of them by their proper names. Howbeit, such is the
curiositie of our countrimen, that notwithstanding almightie God hath so
blessed our realme in most plentifull maner, with such and so manie
quarries apt and meet for piles of longest continuance, yet we as
lothsome of this abundance, or not liking of the plentie, doo commonlie
leaue these naturall gifts to mould and cinder in the ground, and take
vp an artificiall bricke, in burning whereof a great part of the wood of
this land is dailie consumed and spent, to the no small decaie of that
commoditie, and hinderance of the poore that perish oft for cold.</p>

<p>Our elders haue from time to time, following our naturall vice in
misliking of our owne commodities at home, and desiring those of other
countries abroad, most estéemed the cane stone that is brought hither
out of Normandie: and manie euen in these our daies following the same
veine, doo couet in their works almost to vse none other. Howbeit
experience on the one side, and our skilfull masons on the other (whose
iudgement is nothing inferiour to those of other countries) doo affirme,
that in the north and south parts of England, and certeine other places,
there are some quarries, which for hardnesse and beautie are equall to
the outlandish greet. This maie also be confirmed by the kings chappell
at Cambridge, the greatest part of the square stone wherof was brought
thither out of the north. Some commend the veine of white frée stone,
slate, and méere stone, which is betwéene Pentowen, and the blacke head
in Cornewall, for verie fine stuffe. Other doo speake much of the
quarries at Hamden, nine miles from Milberie, and pauing stone of
Burbecke. For toph stone, not a few allow of the quarrie that is at
Dreslie, diuerse mislike not of the veines of hard stone that are at
Oxford, and Burford. One praiseth the free stone at Manchester, &amp;
Prestburie in Glocestershire; another the quarries of the like in
Richmont. The third liketh well of the hard stone in Clee hill in
Shropshire; the fourth of that of Thorowbridge, Welden, and Terrinton.
Whereby it appeareth that we haue quarries inow, and good inough in
England, sufficient for vs to build withall, if the péeuish contempt of
our owne commodities, and delectations to inrich other countries, did
not catch such foolish hold vpon vs. It is also verified (as anie other
waie) that all nations haue rather néed of England, than England of anie
other. And this I thinke may suffice for the substance of our works. Now
if you haue regard to their ornature, how manie mines of sundrie kinds
of course &amp; fine marble are there to be had in England? But chieflie one
in Staffordshire, an other neere to the Peke, the third at Vauldrie, the
fourth at Snothill (longing to the lord Chaindois) the fift at
Eglestone, which is of blacke marble, spotted with graie or white spots,
the sixt not farre from Durham. Of white marble also we haue store, and
so faire as the Marpesian of Paris Ile. But what meane I to go about to
recite all, or the most excellent? sith these which I haue named alredie
<span class="page"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>[Page 395]</span>
are not altogether of the best, nor scarselie of anie value in
comparison of those, whose places of growth are vtterlie vnknowne vnto
me, and whereof the blacke marble spotted with greene is none of the
vilest sort, as maie appeare by parcell of the pauement of the lower
part of the quire of Paules in London, and also in Westminster, where
some péeces thereof are yet to be séene and marked, if anie will looke
for them. If marble will not serue, then haue we the finest alabaster
that maie elsewhere bée had, as about saint Dauids of Wales; also neere
to Beau manour, which is about foure or fiue miles from Leicester, &amp;
taken to be the best, although there are diuerse other quarries hereof
beyond the Trent, as in Yorkeshire, &amp;c: and fullie so good as that,
whose names at this time are out of my remembrance. What should I talke
of the plaister of Axholme (for of that which they dig out of the earth
in sundrie places of Lincolne and Darbishires, wherewith they blanch
their houses in stead of lime, I speake not) certes it is a fine kind of
alabaster. But sith it is sold commonlie but after twelue pence the
load, we iudge it to be but vile and course. For my part I cannot skill
of stone, yet in my opinion it is not without great vse for plaister of
paris, and such is the mine of it, that the stones thereof lie in flakes
one vpon an other like plankes or tables, and vnder the same is an
excéeding hard stone verie profitable for building, as hath often times
béene prooued. This is also to be marked further of our plaister white
and graie, that not contented with the same, as God by the quarrie dooth
send and yéeld it foorth, we haue now deuised to cast it in moulds for
windowes and pillers of what forme and fashion we list, euen as
alabaster it selfe: and with such stuffe sundrie houses in Yorkshire are
furnished of late. But of what continuance this deuise is like to proue,
the time to come shall easilie bewraie. In the meane time sir Rafe
Burcher knight hath put the deuise in practise, and affirmeth that six
men in six moneths shall trauell in that trade to sée greater profit to
the owner, than twelue men in six yeares could before this tricke was
inuented.</p>

<p>If neither alabaster nor marble doeth suffice, we haue the touchstone,
called in Latine <em>Lydius lapis</em>, shining as glasse, either to match in
sockets with our pillers of alabaster, or contrariwise: or if it please
the workeman to ioine pillers of alabaster or touch with sockets of
brasse, pewter, or copper, we want not also these mettals. So that I
think no nation can haue more excellent &amp; greater diuersitie of stuffe
for building, than we maie haue in England, if our selues could so like
of it. But such alas is our nature, that not our own but other mens do
most of all delite vs; &amp; for desire of noueltie, we oft exchange our
finest cloth, corne, tin, and woolles, for halfe penie cockhorsses for
children, dogs of wax or of chéese, two pennie tabers, leaden swords,
painted feathers, gewgaws for fooles, dogtricks for disards,
hawkeswhoods, and such like trumperie, whereby we reape iust mockage and
reproch in other countries. I might remember here our pits for
milstones, that are to be had in diuerse places of our countrie, as in
Angleseie, Kent, also at Queene hope of blew gréet, of no lesse value
than the Colaine, yea than the French stones: our grindstones for
hardware men. Our whetstones are no lesse laudable than those of Creta &amp;
Lacedemonia, albeit we vse no oile with them, as they did in those
parties, but onelie water, as the Italians and Naxians doo with theirs:
whereas they that grow in Cilicia must haue both oile and water laid
vpon them, or else they make no edge. These also are diuided either into
the hard greet, as the common that shoemakers vse, or the soft gréet
called hones, to be had among the barbars, and those either blacke or
white, and the rub or brickle stone which husbandmen doo occupie in the
whetting of their sithes.</p>

<p>In like maner slate of sundrie colours is euerie where in maner to be
had, as is the flint and chalke, the shalder and the peble. Howbeit for
all this wée must fetch them still from farre, as did the Hull men their
stones out of Iseland, wherewith they paued their towne for want of the
like in England: or as sir Thomas Gresham did, when he bought the stones
in Flanders, wherwith he paued the Burse. But as he will answer
peraduenture, that he bargained for the whole mould and substance of his
workemanship in Flanders: so the Hullanders or Hull men will saie, how
that stockefish is light loding, and therfore they did balasse their
vessels with these Iseland stones, to keepe them from turning ouer in
<span class="page"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>[Page 396]</span>
their so tedious a voiage. And thus much brieflie of our quarries of
stone for building, wherein oftentimes the workemen haue found strange
things inclosed, I meane liuelie creatures shut vp in the hard stones,
and liuing there without respiration or breathing, as frogs, todes, &amp;c:
whereof you shall read more in the chronologie following: also in Caius
Langius, William of Newburie, Agricola, Cornelius of Amsterdam,
Bellogius de aquatilibus, Albert the great, lib. 19. cap. 9. "De rebus
metallicis," and Goropius in Niloscopio, pag. 237, &amp;c. Sometime also
they find pretious stones (though seldome) and some of them perfectlie
squared by nature, and much like vnto the diamond, found of late in a
quarrie of marble at Naples, which was so perfectlie pointed, as if all
the workemen in the world had c&#333;sulted about the performance of that
workemanship. I know that these reports vnto some will séeme incredible,
and therefore I stand the longer vpon them; neuerthelesse omitting to
speake particularlie of such things as happen amongst vs, and rather
séeking to confirme the same by the like in other countries, I will
deliuer a few more examples, whereby the truth hereof shall so much the
better appeare. For in the middest of a stone not long since found at
Chius, vpon the breaking vp thereof, there was séene <em>Caput panisci</em>
inclosed therin, very perfectlie formed as the beholders doo remember.
How come the grains of gold to be so fast inclosed in the stones that
are &amp; haue béene found in the Spanish Bætis? But this is most
maruellous, that a most delectable and sweet oile, comparable to the
finest balme, or oile of spike in smell, was found naturallie included
in a stone, which could not otherwise be broken but with a smiths
hammer. Goropius dooth tell of a pearch perfectlie formed to be found in
<span class="leftnote">* [<em>Sic.</em>]</span>
Britaine: but as then * committed into hard stone, vpon the top of a
crag. Aristotle and Theophrast speake of fishes digged out of the earth,
farre from the sea in Greece, which Seneca also confirmeth, but with
addition that they are perillous to be eaten. In pope Martins time, a
serpent was found fast inclosed in a rocke, as the kernell is within the
nut, so that no aire could come to it: and in my time another in a
coffin of stone at Auignion, wherein, a man had béene buried, which so
filled the roome, and laie so close from aire, that all men woondered
how it was possible for the same to liue and continue so long time
there. Finallie I my selfe haue séene stones opened, and within them the
substances of corrupted wormes like vnto adders (but far shorter) whose
crests and wrinkles of bodie appeared also therein, as if they had bene
ingraued in the stones by art and industrie of man. Wherefore to
affirme; that as well liuing creatures, as pretious stones, gold, &amp;c:
are now and then found in our quarries, shall not hereafter be a thing
so incredible as manie talking philosophers, void, of all experience,
doo affirme, and wilfullie mainteine against such as hold the contrarie.</p>

CHAP. X.</h3>

<p>With how great benefits this Iland of ours hath béene indued from the
beginning, I hope there is no godlie man but will readilie confesse, and
yéeld vnto the Lord God his due honour for the same. For we are blessed
euerie waie, &amp; there is no temporall commoditie necessarie to be had or
craued by anie nation at Gods hand, that he hath not in most aboundant
maner bestowed vpon vs Englishmen, if we could sée to vse it, &amp; be
thankefull for the same. But alas (as I said in the chapter precedent)
we loue to inrich them that care not for vs, but for our great
commodities: and one trifling toie not woorth the cariage, c&#333;ming (as
the prouerbe saith) in thrée ships from beyond the sea is more woorth
with vs, than a right good iewell, easie to be had at home. They haue
also the cast to teach vs to neglect our owne things, for if they see
that we begin to make anie account of our commodities (if it be so that
they haue also the like in their owne countries) they will suddenlie
abase the same to so low a price, that our gaine not being woorthie our
trauell, and the same commoditie with lesse cost readie to be had at
home from other countries (though but for a while) it causeth vs to giue
<span class="page"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>[Page 397]</span>
ouer our indeuours, and as it were by and by to forget the matter
wherabout we went before, to obteine them at their hands. And this is
the onelie cause wherefore our commodities are oft so little estéemed
of. Some of them can saie without anie teacher, that they will buie the
case of a fox of an Englishman for a groat, and make him afterward giue
twelue pence for the taile. Would to God we might once wax wiser, and
each one indeuor that the common-wealth of England may flourish againe
in hir old rate, and that our commodities may be fullie wrought at home
(as cloth if you will for an example) and not caried out to be shorne
and dressed abroad, while our clothworkers here doo starue and beg their
bread, and for lacke of dailie practise vtterlie neglect to be skilfull
in this science! But to my purpose.</p>

<p>We haue in England great plentie of quicke siluer, antimonie, sulphur,
blacke lead, and orpiment red and yellow. We haue also the finest alume
<span class="leftnote">The lord Mountioy.</span>
(wherein the diligence of one of the greatest fauourers of the
common-wealth of England of a subiect hath béene of late egregiouslie
abused, and euen almost with barbarous inciuilitie) &amp; of no lesse force
against fire, if it were vsed in our parietings than that of Lipara,
which onlie was in vse somtime amongst the Asians &amp; Romans, &amp; wherof
Sylla had such triall that when he meant to haue burned a tower of wood
erected by Archelaus the lieutenant of Mithridates, he could by no
meanes set it on fire in a long time, bicause it was washed ouer with
alume, as were also the gates of the temple of Jerusalem with like
effect, and perceiued when Titus commanded fire to be put vnto the same.
Beside this we haue also the naturall cinnabarum or vermilion, the
sulphurous glebe called bitumen in old time for morter, and yet burned
in lamps where oile is scant and geason: the chrysocolla, coperis, and
minerall stone, whereof petriolum is made, and that which is most
strange the minerall pearle, which as they are for greatnesse and colour
most excellent of all other, so are they digged out of the maine land,
and in sundrie places far distant from the shore. Certes the westerne
part of the land hath in times past greatlie abounded with these and
manie other rare and excellent commodities, but now they are washed
awaie by the violence of the sea, which hath deuoured the greatest part
of Cornewall and Deuonshire on either side: and it dooth appéere yet by
good record, that whereas now there is a great distance betweene the
Syllan Iles and point of the lands end, there was of late yeares to
speke of scarselie a brooke or draine of one fadam water betwéene them,
if so much, as by those euidences appeereth, and are yet to be séene in
the hands of the lord and chiefe owner of those Iles. But to procéed.</p>

<p>Of colemines we haue such plentie in the north and westerne parts of our
Iland, as may suffice for all the realme of England: and so must they
doo hereafter in deed, if wood be not better cherrished than it is at
this present. And to saie the truth, notwithstanding that verie manie of
them are caried into other countries of the maine, yet their greatest
trade beginneth now to grow from the forge into the kitchin and hall, as
may appéere alreadie in most cities and townes that lie about the coast,
where they haue but little other fewell, except it be turffe and
hassocke. I maruell not a little that there is no trade of these into
Sussex and Southampton shire, for want whereof the smiths doo worke
their iron with charcoale. I thinke that far carriage be the onelie
cause, which is but a slender excuse to inforce vs to carrie them vnto
the maine from hence.</p>

<p>Beside our colemines we haue pits in like sort of white plaster, and of
fat and white and other coloured marle, wherewith in manie places the
inhabitors doo compest their soile, and which dooth benefit their land
in ample maner for manie yeares to come. We haue saltpeter for our
ordinance, and salt soda for our glasse, &amp; thereto in one place a kind
of earth (in Southerie as I weene hard by Codington, and sometime in the
tenure of one Croxton of London) which is so fine to make moulds for
goldsmiths and casters of mettall, that a load of it was woorth fiue
shillings thirtie yeares agone: none such againe they saie in England.
But whether there be or not, let vs not be vnthankefull to God for these
and other his benefits bestowed vpon vs, whereby he sheweth himselfe a
<span class="page"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>[Page 398]</span>
louing and mercifull father vnto vs, which contrariewise returne vnto
him in lieu of humilitie and obedience, nothing but wickednesse,
auarice, meere contempt of his will, pride, excesse, atheisme, and no
lesse than Iewish ingratitude.</p>

<small>OF METTALS TO BE HAD IN OUR LAND.</small><br />

CHAP. XI.</h3>

<p>All mettals receiue their beginning of quicksiluer and sulphur, which
are as mother and father to them. And such is the purpose of nature in
their generations: that she tendeth alwaies to the procreation of gold,
neuerthelesse she sildome reacheth vnto that hir end, bicause of the
vnequall mixture and proportion of these two in the substance
ingendered, whereby impediment and corruption is induced, which as it is
more or lesse, dooth shew it selfe in the mettall that is producted.
First of all therefore the substance of sulphur and quicksiluer being
mixed in due proportion, after long and temperate decoction in the
bowels of the earth, orderlie ingrossed and fixed, becommeth gold, which
Encelius dooth call the sunne and right heire of nature: but if it
swarue but a little (saith he) in the commixtion and other
circumstances, then dooth it product siluer the daughter, not so noble a
child as gold hir brother, which among mettall is worthilie called the
cheefe. Contrariwise, the substances of the aforesaid parents mixed
without proportion, and lesse digested and fixed in the entrailes of the
earth, whereby the radicall moisture becommeth combustible and not of
force to indure heat and hammer, dooth either turne into tin, lead,
copper, or iron, which were the first mettals knowne in time past vnto
antiquitie, although that in these daies there are diuerse other,
whereof neither they nor our alchumists had euer anie knowledge. Of
these therfore which are reputed among the third sort, we here in
England haue our parts, and as I call them to mind, so will I intreat of
them, and with such breuitie as may serue the turne, and yet not
<span class="leftnote">Gold.<br />
Siluer.</span>
altogither omit to saie somewhat of gold and siluer also, bicause I find
by good experience how it was not said of old time without great reason,
that all countries haue need of Britaine, and Britaine it selfe of none.
For truelie if a man regard such necessities as nature onelie requireth,
there is no nation vnder the sunne, that can saie so much as ours: sith
we doo want none that are conuenient for vs. Wherefore if it be a
benefit to haue anie gold at all, we are not void of some, neither
likewise of siluer: whatsoeuer Cicero affirmeth to the contrarie, Lib.
4. ad Atticum epi. 16. in whose time they were not found, "Britannici
belli exitus (saith he) expectatur, constat enim aditus insulæ esse
munitos mirificis molibus: etiam illud iam cognitum est, neque argenti
scrupulum esse vllum in illa insula, neque vllam spem prædæ nisi ex
mancipijs, ex quibus nullos puto te litteris aut musicis eruditos
expectare." And albeit that we haue no such abundance of these (as some
other countries doo yéeld) yet haue my rich countrimen store inough of
both in their pursses, where in time past they were woont to haue least,
bicause the garnishing of our churches, tabernacles, images, shrines and
apparell of the préests consumed the greatest part, as experience hath
confirmed.</p>

<p>Of late my countriemen haue found out I wot not what voiage into the
west Indies, from whence they haue brought some gold, whereby our
countrie is inriched: but of all that euer aduentured into those parts,
none haue sped better than sir Francis Drake whose successe 1582 hath
far passed euen his owne expectation. One Iohn Frobisher in like maner
attempting to séeke out a shorter cut by the northerlie regions into the
peaceable sea and kingdome of Cathaie, happened 1577 vpon certeine
Ilands by the waie, wherein great plentie of much gold appeared, and so
much that some letted not to giue out for certeintie, that Salomon had
his gold from thence, wherewith he builded the temple. This golden shew
made him so desirous also of like successe, that he left off his former
voiage, &amp; returned home to bring news of such things as he had seene.
But when after another voiage it was found to be but drosse, he gaue
<span class="page"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>[Page 399]</span>
ouer both the enterprises, and now keepeth home without anie desire at
all to séeke into farre countries. In truth, such was the plentie of ore
there séene and to be had, that if it had holden perfect, might haue
furnished all the world with abundance of that mettall; the iorneie also
was short and performed in foure or fiue moneths, which was a notable
incouragement. But to proceed.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Tin.<br />
Lead.</span>
Tin and lead, mettals which Strabo noteth in his time to be carried vnto
Marsilis from hence, as Diodorus also confirmeth, are verie plentifull
with vs, the one in Cornewall, Deuonshire (&amp; else-where in the north) the
other in Darbishire, Weredale, and sundrie places of this Iland; whereby
my countriemen doo reape no small commoditie, but especiallie our
pewterers, who in time past imploied the vse of pewter onelie vpon
dishes, pots, and a few other trifles for seruice here at home, whereas
now they are growne vnto such exquisit cunning, that they can in maner
imitate by infusion anie forme or fashion of cup, dish, salt, bowle, or
goblet, which is made by goldsmiths craft, though they be neuer so
curious, exquisite, and artificiallie forged. Such furniture of houshold
of this mettall, as we commonlie call by the name of vessell, is sold
vsuallie by the garnish, which dooth conteine twelue platters, twelue
dishes, twelue saucers, and those are either of siluer fashion, or else
with brode or narrow brims, and bought by the pound, which is now valued
at six or seuen pence, or peraduenture at eight pence. Of porringers,
pots, and other like I speake not, albeit that in the making of all
these things there is such exquisite diligence vsed, I meane for the
mixture of the mettall and true making of this commoditie (by reason of
sharpe laws prouided in that behalfe) as the like is not to be found in
any other trade. I haue béene also informed that it consisteth of a
composition, which hath thirtie pounds of kettle brasse to a thousand
pounds of tin, whervnto they ad thrée or foure pounds of tinglasse: but
as too much of this dooth make the stuffe brickle, so the more the
brasse be, the better is the pewter, and more profitable vnto him that
dooth buie and purchase the same. But to proceed.</p>

<p>In some places beyond the sea a garnish of good flat English pewter of
an ordinarie making (I saie flat, bicause dishes and platters in my time
begin to be made déepe like basons, and are indéed more conuenient both
for sawce, broth, and kéeping the meat warme) is estéemed almost so
pretious, as the like number of vessels that are made of fine siluer,
and in maner no lesse desired amongst the great estates, whose workmen
are nothing so skilfull in that trade as ours, neither their mettall so
good, nor plentie so great, as we haue here in England. The Romans made
excellent looking glasses of our English tin, howbeit our workemen were
not then so exquisite in that feat as the Brundusiens: wherefore the
wrought mettall was carried ouer vnto them by waie of merchandize, and
verie highlie were those glasses estéemed of till siluer came generallie
in place, which in the end brought the tin into such contempt, that in
manner euerie dishwasher refused to looke in other than siluer glasses
for the attiring of hir head. Howbeit the making of siluer glasses had
béene in vse before Britaine was knowne vnto the Romans, for I read that
one Praxiteles deuised them in the yoong time of Pompeie, which was
before the comming of Cæsar into this Iland.</p>

<p>There were mines of lead sometimes also in Wales, which indured so long
till the people had consumed all their wood by melting of the same (as
they did also at Comeristwith six miles from Stradfleur) and I suppose
that in Plinies time the abundance of lead (whereof he speaketh) was to
be found in those parts, in the seauentéenth of his thirtie fourth
booke: also he affirmeth that it laie in the verie swart of the earth,
and dailie gotten in such plentie, that the Romans made a restraint of
the cariage thereof to Rome, limiting how much should yearelie be
wrought and transported ouer the sea. And here by the waie it is worthie
to be noted, of a crow which a miner of tin, dwelling néere Comeristwith
(as Leland saith) had made so tame, that it would dailie flie and follow
him to his worke and other places where soeuer he happened to trauell.
This labourer working on a time in the bottome or vallie, where the
first mine was knowne to be, did laie his pursse and girdle by him, as
men commonlie doo that addresse themselues to applie their businesse
earnestlie, and he himselfe also had vsed from time to time before. The
crow likewise was verie busie flittering about him, and so much molested
<span class="page"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>[Page 400]</span>
him, that he waxed angrie with the bird, &amp; in his furie threatened to
wring off his necke, if he might once get him into his hands; to be
short, in the end the crow, hastilie caught vp his girdle and pursse,
and made awaie withall so fast as hir wings could carrie hir. Héerevpon
the poore man falling into great agonie (for he feared to lose
peraduenture all his monie) threw downe his mattocke at aduenture and
ran after the bird, curssing and menacing that he should lose his life
if euer he got him againe: but as it fell out, the crow was the means
whereby his life was saued, for he had not béene long out of the mine,
yer it fell downe and killed all his fellowes. If I should take vpon me
to discourse and search out the cause of the thus dealing of this bird
at large, I should peraduenture set my selfe further into the briers
than well find which waie to come out againe: yet am I persuaded, that
the crow was Gods instrument herein, wherby the life of this poore
labourer was preserued. It was doone also in an other order than that
which I read of another tame crow, kept vp by a shoomaker of Dutch land
in his shop or stoue: who séeing the same to sit vpon the pearch among
his shoone, verie heauilie and drousie, said vnto the bird: What aileth
my iacke, whie art thou sad and pensiue? The crow hearing his maister
speake after this sort vnto him, answered (or else the diuell within
him) out of the psalter: "Cogitaui dies antiquos &amp; æternos in mente
habui." But whither am I digressed, from lead vnto crowes, &amp; from crowes
vnto diuels? Certes it is now high time to returne vnto our mettals, and
resume the tractation of such things as I had earst in hand.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Iron.</span>
Iron is found in manie places, as in Sussex, Kent, Weredale, Mendip,
Walshall, as also in Shropshire, but chéeflie in the woods betwixt
Beluos and Willocke or Wicberie néere Manchester, and elsewhere in
Wales. Of which mines diuerse doo bring foorth so fine and good stuffe,
as anie that commeth from beyond the sea, beside the infinit gaines to
the owners, if we would so accept it, or bestow a little more cost in
the refining of it. It is also of such toughnesse, that it yéeldeth to
the making of claricord wire in some places of the realme.
Neuerthelesse, it was better cheape with vs when strangers onelie
brought it hither: for it is our qualitie when we get anie commoditie,
to vse it with extremitie towards our owne nation, after we haue once
found the meanes to shut out forreners from the bringing in of the like.
It breedeth in like manner great expense and waste of wood, as dooth the
making of our pots and table vessell of glasse, wherein is much losse
sith it is so quicklie broken; and yet (as I thinke) easie to be made
tougher, if our alchumists could once find the true birth or production
of the red man, whose mixture would induce a metallicall toughnesse vnto
it, whereby it should abide the hammer.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Copper.</span>
Copper is latelie not found, but rather restored againe to light. For I
haue read of copper to haue béene heretofore gotten in our Iland;
howbeit as strangers haue most commonly the gouernance of our mines, so
they hitherto make small gains of this in hand in the north parts: for
(as I am informed) the profit dooth verie hardlie counteruaile the
charges; whereat wise men doo not a litle maruell, considering the
abundance which that mine dooth séeme to offer, and as it were at hand.
Leland our countrieman noteth sundrie great likelihoods of naturall
copper mines to be eastwards, as betwéene Dudman and Trewardth in the
sea cliffes, beside other places, whereof diuerse are noted here and
there in sundrie places of this booke alreadie, and therefore it shall
be but in vaine to repeat them here againe: as for that which is gotten
out of the marchasite, I speake not of it, sith it is not incident to my
purpose. In Dorsetshire also a copper mine latelie found is brought to
good perfection.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Stéele.</span>
As for our stéele, it is not so good for edge-tooles as that of Colaine,
and yet the one is often sold for the other, and like tale vsed in both,
that is to saie, thirtie gads to the sheffe, and twelue sheffes to the
burden. Our alchumie is artificiall, and thereof our spoones and some
salts are commonlie made, and preferred before our pewter with some,
albeit in truth it be much subiect to corruption, putrifaction, more
heauie and foule to handle than our pewter; yet some ignorant persons
affirme it to be a mettall more naturall, and the verie same which
Encelius calleth <em>Plumbum cinereum</em>, the Germans, wisemute, mithan, &amp;
counterfeie, adding, that where it groweth, siluer can not be farre off.
Neuerthelesse it is knowne to be a mixture of brasse, lead, and tin (of
<span class="page"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>[Page 401]</span>
which this latter occupieth the one halfe) but after another proportion
than is vsed in pewter. But alas I am persuaded that neither the old
Arabians, nor new alchumists of our time did euer heare of it, albeit
that the name thereof doo séeme to come out of their forge. For the
common sort indeed doo call it alchumie, an vnwholsome mettall (God wot)
and woorthie to be banished and driuen out of the land. And thus I
conclude with this discourse, as hauing no more to saie of the mettals
of my countrie, except I should talke of brasse, bell mettall, and such
as are brought ouer for merchandize from other countries: and yet I can
not but saie that there is some brasse found also in England, but so
small is the quantitie, that it is not greatlie to be estéemed or
accounted of.</p>

<small>OF PRETIOUS STONES.</small><br />

CHAP. XII.</h3>

<p>The old writers remember few other stones of estimation to be found in
<span class="leftnote">Geat.</span>
this Iland than that which we call geat, and they in Latine <em>Gagaies</em>:
wherevnto furthermore they ascribe sundrie properties, as vsuallie
<span class="leftnote">Laon.<br />
Chalchondile.</span>
practised here in times past, whereof none of our writers doo make anie
mention at all. Howbeit whatsoeuer it hath pleased a number of strangers
(vpon false surmise) to write of the vsages of this our countrie, about
the triall of the virginitie of our maidens by drinking the powder
hereof against the time of their bestowing in mariage: certeine it is
that euen to this daie there is some plentie to be had of this
commoditie in Darbishire and about Barwike, whereof rings, salts, small
cups, and sundrie trifling toies are made, although that in manie mens
opinions nothing so fine as that which is brought ouer by merchants
dailie from the maine. But as these men are drowned with the common
errour conceiued of our nation, so I am sure that in discerning the
price and value of things, no man now liuing can go beyond the iudgement
of the old Romans, who preferred the geat of Britaine before the like
stones bred about Luke and all other countries wheresoeuer. Marbodeus
Gallus also writing of the same among other of estimation, saith thus:</p>

<p class="ind1">Nascitur in Lycia lapis &amp; propè gemma Gagates,<br />
Sed genus eximium fæcunda Britannia mittit,<br />
Lucidus &amp; niger est, leuis &amp; leuissimus idem,<br />
Vicinas paleas trahit attritu calefactus,<br />
Ardet aqua lotus, restinguitur vnctus oliuo.</p>

<p>The Germane writers confound it with amber as it were a kind therof: but
as I regard not their iudgement in this point, so I read that it taketh
name of Gagas a citie and riuer in Silicia, where it groweth in
plentifull maner, as Dioscorides saith. Nicander in Theriaca calleth it
Engangin and Gangitin, of the plentie thereof that is found in the place
aforesaid, which he calleth Ganges, and where they haue great vse of it
in driuing awaie of serpents by the onelie perfume thereof. Charles the
fourth emperour of that name glased the church withall that standeth at
the fall of Tangra, but I cannot imagine what light should enter therby.
The writers also diuide this stone into fiue kinds, of which the one is
in colour like vnto lion tawnie, another straked with white veines, the
third with yellow lines, the fourth is garled with diuerse colours,
among which some are like drops of bloud (but those come out of Inde)
and the fift shining blacke as anie rauens feather.</p>

<p>Moreouer, as geat was one of the first stones of this Ile, whereof anie
forren account was made, so our pearles also did match with it in
renowme; in so much that the onelie desire of them caused Cæsar to
aduenture hither, after he had séene the quantities and heard of our
plentie of them, while he abode in France, and whereof he made a taberd
which he offered vp in Rome to Venus, where it hoong long after as a
rich and notable oblation and testimonie of the riches of our countrie.
Certes they are to be found in these our daies, and thereto of diuerse
<span class="page"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>[Page 402]</span>
colours, in no lesse numbers than euer they were in old time. Yet are
they not now so much desired bicause of their smalnesse, and also for
other causes, but especiallie sith churchworke, as copes, vestments,
albes, tunicles, altarclothes, canopies, and such trash, are worthilie
abolished; vpon which our countrimen superstitiously bestowed no small
quantities of them. For I thinke there were few churches or religious
houses, besides bishops miters, bookes and other pontificall vestures,
but were either throughlie fretted, or notablie garnished with huge
numbers of them. Marbodeus likewise speaking of pearles, commendeth them
after this maner:</p>

<p class="ind1">Gignit &amp; insignes antiqua Britannia baccas, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Marcellinus also Lib. 23, "in ipso fine," speaketh of our pearls and
their generation, but he preferreth greatlie those of Persia before
them, which to me dooth séeme vnequallie doone. But as the British geat
or orient pearle were in old time estéemed aboue those of other
countries; so time hath since the conquest of the Romans reuealed manie
other: insomuch that at this season there are found in England the
Aetites (in English called the ernestone, but for erne some pronounce
eagle) and the hematite or bloodstone, and these verie pure and
excellent: also the calcedonie, the porphyrite, the christall, and those
other which we call calaminares and speculares, besides a kind of
diamond or adamant, which although it be verie faire to sight, is yet
much softer (as most are that are found &amp; bred toward the north) than
those that are brought hither out of other countries. We haue also vpon
our coast the white corall, nothing inferiour to that which is found
beyond the sea in the albe, néere to the fall of Tangra, or to the red
and blacke, whereof Dioscorides intreateth, Lib. 5. cap. 8. We haue in
like sort sundrie other stones dailie found in cliffes and rocks (beside
the load stone which is oftentimes taken vp out of our mines of iron)
whereof such as find them haue either no knowledge at all, or else doo
make but small account, being seduced by outlandish lapidaries, whereof
the most part discourage vs from the searching and séeking out of our
owne commodities, to the end that they maie haue the more frée vtterance
of their naturall and artificiall wares, whereby they get great gaines
amongst such as haue no skill.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Triall of a stone.</span>
I haue heard that the best triall of a stone is to laie it on the naile
of the thombe, and so to go abroad into the cleare light, where if the
colour hold in all places a like, the stone is thought to be naturall
and good: but if it alter, especiallie toward the naile, then is it not
sound, but rather to be taken for an artificiall péece of practise. If
<span class="leftnote">Lib. 7.</span>
this be true it is an experiment woorthie the noting. Cardan also hath
it in his "De subtilitate;" if not, I haue read more lies than this, as
one for example out of Cato, who saieth, that a cup of iuie will hold no
wine at all. I haue made some vessels of the same wood, which refuse no
kind of liquor, and therefore I suppose that there is no such
<em>Antipathia</em> betweene wine and our iuie, as some of our reading
philosophers (without all maner of practise) will seeme to infer amongst
vs: and yet I denie not but the iuie of Gréece or Italie may haue such a
propertie; but why should not the iuie then of France somewhat
participat withall in the like effect, which groweth in an hotter soile
than ours is? For as Baptista porta saith, it holdeth not also in the
French iuie, wherfore I can not beléeue that it hath anie such qualitie
at all as Cato ascribeth vnto it. What should I say more of stones?
Trulie I can not tell, sith I haue said what I may alreadie, and
peraduenture more than I thinke necessarie: and that causeth me to passe
ouer those that are now &amp; then taken out of our oisters, todes, muskels,
snailes and adders, and likewise such as are found vpon sundrie hils in
Glocestershire, which haue naturallie such sundrie proportions, formes &amp;
colours in them, as passe all humane possibilitie to imitate, be the
workeman neuer so skilfull and cunning, also those that are found in the
heads of our perches and carps much desired of such as haue the stone, &amp;
yet of themselues are no stones but rather shels or gristles, which in
time consume to nothing. This yet will I ad, that if those which are
found in muskels (for I am vtterlie ignorant of the generation of
pearls) be good pearle in déed, I haue at sundrie times gathered more
<span class="page"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>[Page 403]</span>
than an ounce of them, of which diuerse haue holes alreadie entered by
nature, some of them not much inferiour to great peason in quantitie,
and thereto of sundrie colours, as it happeneth amongst such as are
brought from the esterlie coast to Saffron Walden in Lent, when for want
of flesh, stale stinking fish and welked muskels are thought to be good
meat; for other fish is too déere amongst vs when law dooth bind vs to
vse it. Sée more for the generation of pearls in the description of
Scotland, for there you shall be further informed out of Boetius in that
behalfe. They are called orient, because of the cléerenesse, which
resembleth the colour of the cléere aire before the rising of the sun.
They are also sought for in the later end of August, a little before
which time the swéetnesse of the dew is most conuenient for that kind of
fish, which dooth ingender and conceiue them, whose forme is flat, and
much like vnto a lempet. The further north also that they be found the
brighter is their colour, &amp; their substances of better valure, as
lapidaries doo giue out.</p>

<small>OF SALT MADE IN ENGLAND.</small><br />

CHAP. XIII.</h3>

<p>There are in England certein welles where salt is made, whereof Leland
hath written abundantlie in his c&#333;mentaries of Britaine, and whose
words onlie I will set downe in English as he wrote them, bicause he
seemeth to haue had diligent consideration of the same, without adding
anie thing of mine owne to him, except it be where necessitie dooth
inforce me for the méere aid of the reader, in the vnderstanding of his
mind. Directing therefore his iournie from Worcester in his
peregrination and laborious trauell ouer England, he saith thus: From
Worcester I road to the Wich by inclosed soile, hauing meetlie good
corne ground, sufficient wood and good pasture, about a six miles off,
Wich standeth somewhat in a vallie or low ground, betwixt two small hils
on the left ripe (for so he calleth the banke of euerie brooke through
out all his English treatises) of a pretie riuer which not far beneath
the Wich is called Salope brooke. The beautie of the towne in maner
standeth in one stréet, yet be there manie lanes in the towne besides.
There is also a meane church in the maine stréet, and once in the wéeke
an indifferent round market. The towne of it selfe is somewhat foule and
durtie when anie raine falleth by reason of much cariage through the
stréets, which are verie ill paued or rather not paued at all. The great
aduancement also hereof is by making of salt. And though the commoditie
thereof be singular great, yet the burgesses be poore generallie,
bicause gentlemen haue for the most part gotten the great gaine of it
<span class="leftnote">A common plague in all things of anie great commoditie,
for one beateth the bush but another catcheth the birds,
as we may sée in bat-fowling.</span>
into their hands, whilest the poore burgesses yeeld vnto all the labour.
There are at this present time thrée hundred salters, and thrée salt
springs in the towne of Wich, whereof the principall is within a
butshoot of the right ripe (or banke) of the riuer that there commeth
downe: and this spring is double so profitable in yéelding of salt
liquor, as both the other. Some saie (or rather fable) that this salt
spring did faile in the time of Richard de la Wich bishop of Chichester,
and that afterwards by his intercession it was restored to the profit of
the old course (such is the superstition of the people) in remembrance
whereof, or peraduenture for the zeale which the Wich men and salters
did beare vnto Richard de la Wich their countriman, they vsed of late
times on his daie (which commeth once in the yeare) to hang this salt
spring or well about with tapistrie, and to haue sundrie games,
drinkings, and foolish reuels at it. But to procéed. There be a great
number of salt cotes about this well, wherein the salt water is sodden
in leads, and brought to the perfection of pure white salt. The other
two salt springs be on the left side of the riuer a pretie waie lower
than the first, and (as I found) at the verie end of the towne. At these
also be diuerse fornaces to make salt, but the profit and plentie of
these two are nothing comparable to the gaine that riseth by the
greatest. I asked of a salter how manie fornaces they had at all the
three springs, and he numbred them to eightéene score, that is, thrée
hundred and sixtie, saieng how euerie one of them paied yearelie six
<span class="page"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>[Page 404]</span>
shillings and eight pence to the king. The truth is that of old they had
liberties giuen vnto them for three hundred fornaces or more, and
therevpon they giue a fee farme (or <em>Vectigal</em>) of one hundred pounds
yearelie. Certes the pension is as it was, but the number of fornaces is
now increased to foure hundred. There was of late search made for
another salt spring there abouts, by the meanes of one Newport a
gentleman dwelling at the Wich, and the place where it was appéereth, as
dooth also the wood and timber which was set about it, to kéepe vp the
earth from falling into the same. But this pit was not since occupied,
whether it were for lacke of plentie of the salt spring, or for letting
or hindering of the profit of the other three. Me thinke that if wood
and sale of salt would serue, they might dig and find more salt springs
about the Wich than thrée, but there is somewhat else in the wind. For I
<span class="leftnote">Priuileges doo somtimes harme.</span>
heard that of late yeares a salt spring was found in an other quarter of
Worcestershire, but it grew to be without anie vse, sith the Wich men
haue such a priuilege, that they alone in those quarters shall haue the
making of salt. The pits be so set about with gutters, that the salt
water is easilie turned to euerie mans house, and at Nantwich verie
manie troughs go ouer the riuer for the commoditie of such as dwell on
the other side of the same. They séeth also their salt water in fornaces
of lead, and lade out the salt some in cases of wicker, through which
the water draineth, and the salt remaineth. There be also two or thrée
but verie little salt springs at Dertwitch, in a low bottome, where salt
is sometime made.</p>

<p>Of late also a mile from Cumbremere abbaie a peece of an hill did sinke,
and in the same pit rose a spring of salt water, where the abbat began
to make salt; but the men of the citie compounded with the abbat &amp;
couent that there should be none made there, whereby the pit was
suffered to go to losse. And although it yéelded salt water still of it
selfe, yet it was spoiled at the last and filled vp with filth. The Wich
men vse the c&#333;moditie of their salt springs in drawing and decocting
the water of them onlie by six moneths in the yeare, that is, from
Midsummer to Christmas, as (I gesse) to mainteine the price of salt, or
for sauing of wood, which I thinke to be their principall reason. For
making of salt is a great and notable destruction of wood, and shall be
greater hereafter, except some prouision be made for the better increase
of firing. The lacke of wood also is alreadie perceiued in places néere
the Wich, for whereas they vsed to buie and take their wood neere vnto
their occupiengs, those woonted springs are now decaied, and they be
inforced to seeke their wood so far as Worcester towne, and all the
parts about Brenisgraue, Alchirch, and Alcester. I asked a salter how
much wood he supposed yearelie to be spent at these fornaces? and he
answered that by estimation there was consumed about six thousand load,
and it was round pole wood for the most, which is easie to be cleft, and
handsomelie riuen in péeces. The people that are about the fornaces are
verie ill coloured, and the iust rate of euerie fornace is to make foure
loads of salt yearelie, and to euerie load goeth fiue or six quarters as
they make their accounts. If the fornace men make more in one fornace
than foure loads, it is (as it is said) imploied to their owne auaile.
And thus much hath Leland left in memorie of our white salt, who in an
other booke, not now in my hands, hath touched the making also of baie
salt in some part of our countrie. But sith that booke is deliuered
againe to the owner, the tractation of baie salt can not be framed in
anie order, bicause my memorie will not serue to shew the true maner and
the place. It shall suffice therfore to haue giuen such notice of it, to
the end the reader may know that aswell the baie as white are wrought
and made in England, and more white also vpon the west coast toward
Scotland, in Essex and else where, out of the salt water betwéene Wire
and Cokermouth, which commonlie is of like price with our wheat.
Finallie, hauing thus intermedled our artificiall salt with our
minerals, let vs giue ouer, and go in hand with such mettals as are
growing here in England.</p>

<small>OF OUR ACCOMPT OF TIME &amp; HIR PARTS.</small><br />

CHAP. XIV.</h3>

<p>As <em>Libra</em> is <em>As</em> or <em>Assis</em> to the Romans for their weight, and the
foot in standard measure: so in our accompt of the parts of time, we
take the daie consisting of foure and twentie houres, to be the greatest
of the least, and least of the greatest, whereby we keepe our reckoning:
for of the houre (to saie the truth) the most ancient Romans, Greeks,
nor Hebrues had anie vse; sith they reckoned by watches: and whereof
also Censorinus cap. 19. sheweth a reason wherefore they were neglected.
For my part I doo not sée anie great difference vsed in the obseruation
of time &amp; hir parts, betwéene our owne &amp; any other forren nation,
wherfore I shall not néed to stand long on this matter. Howbeit to the
end our exact order herein shall appéere vnto all men, I will set downe
some short rehearsall thereof, and that in so briefe manner as vnto me
is possible. As for our astronomicall practises, I meane not to meddle
with them, sith their course is vniformelie obserued, ouer all. Our
common order therefore is to begin at the minut, which conteineth 1/60
part of an houre, as at the smallest part of time knowne vnto the
people, notwithstanding that in most places they descend no lower than
the halfe quarter or quarter of the houre; and from whence they procéed
vnto the houre, to wit, the foure and twentith part of that which we
call the common and naturall daie, which dooth begin at midnight, and is
obserued continuallie by clockes, dialles, and astronomicall instruments
of all sorts. The artificiall varietie of which kind of ware is so great
here in England, as no place else (in mine opinion) can be comparable
therein to this Ile. I will not speake of the cost bestowed vpon them in
perle and stone, neither of the valure of mettall, whereof they haue
béene made, as gold, siluer, &amp;c: and almost no abbeie or religious house
without some of them. This onelie shall suffice to note here (as by the
waie) that as antiquitie hath delighted in these things, so in our time
pompe and excesse spendeth all, and nothing is regarded that bringeth in
no bread. Of vnequall or temporall houres or daies, our nation hath no
regard, and therefore to shew their quantities, differences, and
diuisions, into the greater and the lesser, (whereof the later
conteineth one vnequall houre, or the rising of halfe a signe, the other
of a whole signe, which is in two houres space, wherof Marke seemth to
speake cap. 15 c 25, as the rest of the euangelists (yea and he also
ibid. vers. 33) doo of the other, Matth. 27 e 45, Luke 23 e 44, John 19
b 14) it should be but in vaine. In like sort, wheras the elder
Aegyptians, Italians, Bohemians, latter Atheniens, and Iews begin their
daie at the sun set ouer night; the Persians, Babylonians, Grecians, and
Noribergians, at the sun rising (ech of them accompting their daies and
nights by vnequall houres) also the elder Atheniens, Arabians, Dutchmen,
Vmbers, Hetrurians, and Astronomers at high noone, and so reckon from
noone to noone: we after Hipparchus and the latter Aegyptians, or to
speake more properlie, imitating the Roman maner vsed in the church
there of long time, choose the verie point of midnight; from whence we
accompt twelue equall houres vnto middaie insuing, and other twelue
againe vnto the aforesaid point, according to these verses;</p>

<p class="ind1">Manè diem Græca gens incipit astra sequentes<br />
In medio lucis Iudæis vespere sancta,<br />
Inchoat ecclesia media sua tempora nocte.</p>

<p>And this is our generall order for the naturall daie. Of the artificiall
we make so farre accompt, as that we reckon it daie when the sun is vp,
and night when the sun leaueth our horizon. Otherwise also we diuide it
into two parts, that is to saie, fore noone and after noone, not
regarding the ruddie, shining, burning and warming seasons (of thrée
<span class="page"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>[Page 406]</span>
vnequall houres a péece, which others séeme to diuide into spring time,
summer, autumne, and winter, in like curious manner) and whereof I read
these verses:</p>

<p class="ind1">Solis equi lucis dicuntur quatuor horæ,<br />
Hæc rubet, hæc splendet, hæc calet, illa tepet.</p>

<p>Indéed our physicians haue another partition of the daie, as men of no
lesse learning no doubt than the best of forren countries, if we could
so conceiue of them. And herein they concurre also with those of other
nations, who for distinction in regiment of our humors, diuide the
artificiall daie and night in such wise as these verses doo import, and
are indéed a generall rule which ech of them doth follow:</p>

<p class="ind1">Tres lucis primas, noctis tres sanguinis imas,<br />
Vis choleræ medias lucis sex vendicat horas.<br />
Dátque melam primas noctis, tres lucis &amp; imas,<br />
Centrales ponas sex noctis phlegmatis horas.</p>

<p>Or thus, as Tansteter hath giuen them foorth in his prelections:</p>

<p class="ind1">A nona noctis donec sit tertia lucis,<br />
Est dominus sanguis, sex inde sequentibus horis<br />
Est dominans cholera, dum lucis nona sit hora<br />
Post niger humid inest donec sit tertia noctis,<br />
Posthæc phlegma venit, donec sit nona quietis.</p>

<p><em>In English thus in effect</em>:</p>

<p class="ind1">Three houres yer sun doo rise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so manie after, blud,<br />
From nine to three at after noone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hot choler beares the swaie,<br />
Euen so to nine at night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swart choler hath to rule,<br />
As phlegme from thence to three at morne;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;six houres ech one I saie.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Night.<br />
Vesper.</span>
In like sort for the night we haue none other parts than the twilight,
darkenight, midnight, and cocks crowing: wheras the Latins diuide the
same into 7 parts, as <em>Vesper</em> or <em>Vesperugo</em>, as Plautus calleth it, as
Virgil vseth the word <em>Hesper</em> the euening, which is immediatlie after
<span class="rightnote">Crepsuculum.</span>
the setting of the sun. <em>Crepusculum</em> the twilight (which some call
<em>Prima fax</em>, because men begin then to light candles) when it is
betwéene daie and night, light and darkenesse, or properlie neither daie
<span class="leftnote">Concubium.</span>
nor night. <em>Concubium</em> the still of the night, when ech one is laid to
rest.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Intempestum.</span>
<em>Intempestum</em>, the dull or dead of the night, which is midnight, when
<span class="rightnote">Gallicinium.<br />
Conticinium.<br />
Matutinum.<br />
Diluculum.</span>
men be in their first or dead sléepe. <em>Gallicinium</em>, the cocks crowing.
<em>Conticinium</em>, when the cocks haue left crowing. <em>Matutinum</em>, the breach
of the daie, and <em>Diluculum siue aurora</em>, the ruddie, orenge, golden or
shining colour, séene immediatlie before the rising of the sun, and is
opposite to the euening, as <em>Matutinum</em> is to the twilight.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Watches.</span>
Other there are which doo reckon by watches, diuiding the night after
sun setting into foure equall parts. Of which the first beginneth at
euening called the first watch, and continueth by thrée vnequall houres,
and so foorth vntill the end of the ninth houre, whereat the fourth
watch entreth, which is called the morning watch, bicause it concurreth
partlie with the darke night, and partlie with the morning and breach of
the daie before the rising of the sun.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Houre.</span>
As for the originall of the word houre, it is verie ancient; but yet not
so old as that of the watch, wherof we shall read abundantlie in the
scriptures, which was deuised first among souldiors for their better
safegard and change of watchmen in their camps; the like whereof is
<span class="page"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>[Page 407]</span>
almost vsed among our seafaring men, which they call clearing of the
glasse, and performed from time to time with great héed and some
solemnitie. Herevnto the word <em>Hora</em> among the Grecians signified so
well the foure quarters of the yéere, as the foure and twentith part of
the daie, and limits of anie forme. But what stand I vpon these things
to let my purpose staie? To procéed therefore.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Wéeke.</span>
Of naturall daies is the wéeke compacted, which consisteth of seauen of
them, the fridaie being commonlie called among the vulgar sort either
king or worling, bicause it is either the fairest or foulest of the
seauen: albeit that I cannot ghesse of anie reason whie they should so
imagine. The first of these entreth with mondaie, whereby it commeth to
passe, that we rest vpon the sundaie, which is the seauenth in number,
as almightie God hath commanded in his word. The Iews begin their wéeke
vpon our saturdaie at the setting of the sun: and the Turks in these
daies with the saturdaie, whereby it commeth to passe, that as the Iews
make our last daie the first of their wéeke, so the Turks make the
Iewish sabaoth the beginning of their <em>Hebdoma</em>: bicause Mahomet their
prophet (as they saie) was borne and dead vpon the fridaie, and so he
was indéed, except their Alcharon deceiue them. The Iews doo reckon
their daies by their distance from their sabaoth, so that the first daie
of their wéeke is the first daie of the sabaoth, and so foorth vnto the
sixt. The Latins and Aegyptians accompted their daies after the seauen
planets, choosing the same for the denominator of the daie, that entreth
his regiment with the first vnequall houre of the same after the sun be
risen. Howbeit, as this order is not wholie reteined with vs, so the vse
of the same is not yet altogither abolished, as may appéere by our
sunday, mondaie, and saturdaie. The rest were changed by the Saxons, who
in remembrance of Theut sometime their prince, called the second day of
the wéek Theutsdach, the third Woden, Othin, Othon, or Edon, or
Wodensdach. Also of Thor they named the fourth daie Thorsdach, and of
Frea wife to Woden the fift was called Freadach. Albeit there are (and
not amisse as I thinke) that suppose them to meane by Thor, Iupiter, by
Woden, Mercurie, by Frea (or Frigga as Saxo calleth hir) Venus, and
finallie by Theut, Mars: which if it be so, then it is an easie matter
to find out the german Mars, Venus, Mercurie, and Iupiter, whereof you
may read more hereafter in my chronologie. The truth is, that Frea
albeit that Saxo giueth hir scant a good report, for that she loued one
of hir husbands men better than himselfe, had seauen sonnes by Woden;
the first, father to Wecca, of whome descended those that were
afterwards kings of Kent. Fethelgeta was the second, and of him came the
kings of Mercia. Baldaie the third, father to the kings of the west
Saxons. Beldagius the fourth, parent to the kings of Brenicia or
Northumberland. Weogodach the fift, author of the kings of Deira. Caser
the sixt race of the east Angle race, &amp; Nascad originall burgeant of the
kings of Essex. As for the kings of Sussex, although they were of the
same people, yet were they not of the same streine, as our old monuments
doo expresse. But to procéed.</p>

<p>As certeine of our daies suffered this alteration by the Saxons, so in
<span class="rightnote">* <em>Ferias.</em></span>
our churches we reteined for a long time the number of daies or of *
feries from the sabaoth, after the manner of the Iews, I meane vntill
the seruice after the Romane vse was abolished, which custome was first
receiued (as some thinke) by pope Syluester, though other saie by
Constantine; albeit another sort doo affirme, that Syluester caused the
sundaie onelie to be called the Lords day, and dealt not with the rest.</p>

<p><span class="leftnote">Moneth.</span>
In like maner of wéekes our moneths are made, which are so called of the
moone, each one conteining eight and twentie daies, or foure wéekes,
without anie further curiositie. For we reckon not our time by the yeare
of the moone, as the Iews, Grecians, or Romans did at the first; or as
the Turks, Arabians and Persians doo now: neither anie parcell thereof
by the said planet, as in some part of the west Indies, where they haue
neither weeke, moneth, nor yéere, but onlie a generall accompt of
hundreds and thousands of moones. Wherefore if we saie or write a
moneth, it is to be expounded of eight and twentie daies, or foure wéeks
onelie, and not of hir vsuall period of nine and twentie daies and one
<span class="leftnote"><em>Triuethus in Antarticos.</em></span>
and thirtie minuts. Or (if you take it at large) for a moneth of the
common calender, which neuerthelesse in plées and sutes is nothing at
<span class="page"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>[Page 408]</span>
all allowed of, sith the moone maketh hir full reuolution in eight and
twentie daies or foure weeks, that is, vnto the place where she left the
sun: notwithstanding that he be now gone, and at hir returne not to be
found verie often in that signe wherin she before had left him. Plutarch
writeth of diuers barbarous nations which reckoned a more or lesse
number of these moneths for whole yeares: and that of these some
accompted but thrée, as the Archadians did foure, the Acarnans six, and
the Aegyptians but one for a whole yeare, which causeth them to make
such a large accompt of their antiquitie and originall. But forsomuch as
we are not troubled with anie such disorder, it shall suffice that I
haue generallie said of moneths and their quantities at this time. Now a
word or two of the ancient Romane calender.</p>

<p>In old time each moneth of the Romane calender was reckoned after the
course of the moone, and their enterances were vncerteine, as were also
the changes of that planet: whereby it came to passe, that the daie of
the change was the first of the moneth, howsoeuer it fell out. But after
Iulius Cesar had once corrected the same, the seuerall beginnings of
euerie one of them did not onelie remaine fixed, but also the old order
in the diuision of their parts continued still vnaltered: so that the
moneth is yet diuided as before, into calends, ides and nones, albeit
that in my daies, the vse of the same bée but small, and their order
reteined onelie in our calenders, for the better vnderstanding of such
times, as the historiographers and old authors doo remember. The
reckoning also of each of these goeth (as you sée) after a preposterous
order, whereby the Romans did rather note how many daies were to the
next change from the precedent, than contrariwise, as by perusall of the
same you shall more easilie perceiue.</p>

<p>The daies also of the change of the moneth of the moone, are called
<em>Calendæ</em>, which in time of paganisme were consecrated to Iuno, and
sacrifice made to that goddesse on the same. On these daies also, and on
the ides and nones they would not marie. Likewise the morow after each
of them were called <em>Dies atri</em>, blacke daies, as were also diuerse
other, and those either by reason of some notable ouerthrow or mishap
that befell vnto the Romans vpon those daies, or in respect of some
superstitious imagination conceiued of euill successe likelie to fall
out vpon the same. Of some they were called <em>Dies Aegyptiaci</em>. Wherby it
appeareth that this peeuish estimation of these daies came from that
nation. And as we doo note our holie and festiuall daies with red
letters in our calenders, so did the Romans their principall feasts &amp;
circle of the moone, either in red or golden letters, and their
victories in white, in their publike or consularie tables. This also is
more to be added, that if anie good successe happened afterward vpon
such day as was alreadie blacke in their calender, they would solemnlie
enter it in white letters by racing out of the blacke, whereby the
blacke daie was turned into white, and wherein they not a little
reioised.</p>

<p>The word <em>Calendæ</em> (in Gréeke <em>Neomenia</em>) is deriued of <em>Calo</em>, to call:
for vpon the first day of euerie moneth, the priest vsed to call the
people of the citie and countrie togither in Calabria, for so the place
was called where they met, and shew them by a custome how manie daies
were from the said calends to the nones, &amp; what feasts were to be
celebrated betwéene that and the next change. Their order is retrograde,
because that after the moneth was halfe expired, or the moone past the
full, they reckoned by the daies to come vntill the next change, as
seuentéene daies, sixtéene daies, fourtéene daies, &amp;c: as the Gréekes
did in the latter decad onelie, for they had no vse of calends. The
verie day therefore of the change is called <em>Calendæ</em>, dedicated to
Iuno, who thereof was also called <em>Calendaris</em>. At the first also the
fasts or feast daies were knowne by none other meanes vnto the people
but by the denunciation of the priests (as I said) vpon this daie, till
Flauius Scriba caused them to be written &amp; published in their common
calenders, contrarie to the will and meaning of the senat, for the ease
and benefit of the people, as he pretended.</p>

<p>The nones commonlie are not aboue foure or six in euerie moneth: and so
long as the nones lasted, so long did the markets continue, and
therefore they were called <em>Nonæ quasi Nundinæ</em>. In them also were
neither holiedaies more than is at this present (except the day of the
<span class="page"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>[Page 409]</span>
purification of our ladie) no sacrifice offered to the gods, but each
one applied his businesse, and kept his market, reckoning the first day
after the calends or change, to be the fourth or sixt daie before the
faire ended. Some thinke that they were called <em>Nonæ</em>, of the word
<em>Non</em>, "quia in ijsdem dij non coluntur." For as Ouid saith, "Nonarum
tutela deo caret," or for that the nones were alwaies on the ninth daie
before the ides: other because <em>Nundina dea</em> was honored the ninth day
before the ides, albeit I suppose rather that <em>Nundina dea</em> (a goddesse
far yoonger than the name of <em>Nonæ</em>) tooke hir name of the nones,
whereon it was a custome among the Romans, "Lustrare infantes ac nomina
maribus imponere," as they did with their maid children vpon the eight:
but howsoeuer this be, sure it is that they were the mart daies of
euerie moneth, wherin the people bought, sold, exchanged or bartered,
and did nothing else.</p>

<p>The ides are so named of the Hethruscan word, <em>Iduare</em>, to diuide: and
before that Cesar altered the calender, they diuided the moneth
commonlie by the middest. But afterward when he had added certeine daies
thereto, therby to make it agrée to the yéere of the sunne (which he
intruded about the end of euerie moneth, bicause he would not alter the
celebration of their vsuall feasts, whereof the chiefe were holden
alwaies vpon the day of the ides) then came they short of the middest,
sometime by two or thrée daies. In these therefore (which alwaies are
eight) the merchants had leisure to packe vp and conueie their
merchandize, to pay their creditors, and make merie with their friends.</p>

<p>After the ides doo the calends follow, but in a decreasing order (as I
noted) as the moone dooth in light when she is past the full. But herein
lieth all the mysterie, if you can say so manie daies before the next
change or new moone, as the number there expressed dooth betoken, as for
16 calends so manie daies before the next coniunction, &amp;c: (as is aboue
remembred.) Of these calends, I meane touching their number in euerie
moneth, I find these verses insuing:</p>

<p class="ind1">Ianus &amp; Augustus denas nouémq; December,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iunius Aprilis September &amp; ipse Nouember<br />
Ter senas retinent, Februs his octo calendas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iulius October Mars Maius epta decémq;</p>

<p class="indent1"><em>In English thus</em>:</p>

<p class="ind2">December Iune and August month<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full nineteene calends haue,<br />
Septemb Aprill Nouemb and Iune<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twise nine they doo desire,<br />
Sixteene foule Februarie hath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no more can he well craue,<br />
October Maie and Iulie hot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but seuenteene doo require.</p>

<p class="indent1"><em>In like maner doo the nones and ides.</em></p>

<p class="ind1">Sex Maius nonas, October, Iulius, &amp; Mars,<br />
Quatuor at reliqui, dabit idus quilibet octo.</p>

<p class="ind2">To Iulie, Mars, October, Maie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;six nones I hight,<br />
The rest but foure, and as for ides<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they keepe still eight.</p>

<p>Againe touching the number of daies in euerie moneth:</p>

<p class="ind1">Iunius, Aprilis, Septémq; Nouémq; tricenos,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vnum plus reliqui, Februs tenet octo vicenos,<br />
At si bissextus fuerit superadditur vnus.</p>

<p><span class="page"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>[Page 410]</span></p>

<p class="ind2">Thirtie daies hath Nouember,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aprill, Iune, and September,<br />
Twentie and eight hath Februarie alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the rest thirtie and one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but in the leape you must ad one.</p>

<p>Our yeare is counted after the course of the sunne, and although the
church hath some vse of that of the moone for obseruation of certeine
mooueable feasts, yet it is reducible to that of the sunne, which in our
ciuill dealings is chieflie had in vse. Herein onelie I find a scruple,
that the beginning thereof is not vniforme and certeine, for most of our
records beare date the 25 of March, and our calenders the first of
Ianuarie; so that with vs Christ is borne before he be conceiued. Our
sundrie officers also haue sundrie entrances into their charges of
custome, which bréedeth great confusion, whereas if all these might be
referred to one originall (and that to be the first of Ianuarie) I doo
not thinke but that there would be more certeintie, and lesse trouble
for our historiographers, notaries, &amp; other officers in their account of
the yere. In old time the Atheniens began their yeare with the change of
the moone that fell néerest to the enterance of the sunne into the crab,
the Latines at the winter solstice, or his going into the goat, the
Iewes in ciuill case at the latter equinoctiall, and in ecclesiasticall
with the first. They of Calecute begin their yeare somewhere in
September, but vpon no daie certeine, sith they first consult with their
wisards, who pronounce one day or other thereof to be most happie (as
the yeare goeth about) and therewith they make their entrance, as
Osorius dooth remember, who addeth that vpon the eleuenth calends of
September, they haue solemne plaies, much like to the idoll games, &amp;
that they write in leaues of tree with a pencill, in stead of paper,
which is not found among them. Some of the old Grecians began their yere
also in September: but sith we seeke herein but for the custome of our
countrie onelie, it shall be enough to affirme that we make our account
from the calends or first of Ianuarie, and from the middest of the night
which is <em>Limes</em> betweene that and the last of December, whereof this
maie suffice. I might speake of the Cynike yeare also in this place (for
the ease of our English readers) sometime in vse amongst the Egyptians,
which conteineth 1460 common yeares, whose beginning is alwaies reckoned
from the rising of the lesser dog. The first vse thereof entered the
selfe yeare wherin the Olimpiads were restored. And forsomuch as this
nation hath no vse of intercalation, at the end of euerie 1460 yeares,
they added an whole yeare of intercalation, because there are 365 leape
yeers in the period, so that 1460 Iulian yéers doo conteine 1461 after
the Egyptians account, wherby their common yeare is found to be lesse
than ours. Furthermore, wheras our intercalation for the leape yere is
somewhat too much by certeine minuts, which in 115 yeares amount vnto
about an whole day, if one intercalation in so manie were omitted, our
calender would be the more perfect: and I would wish that the same yeare
wherein the said intercalation trulie found out should be ouerpassed,
might be obserued and called <em>Annus magnus Elizabethæ</em>, in perpetuall
remembrance of our noble and souereigne princesse now reigning amongst
vs.</p>

<p>I might here saie somewhat also of the prime and hir alteration, which
is risen higher by fiue daies in our common calender than it was placed
by Iulius Cæsar: and in seauen thousand yeares some writer would grow
to an error of an whole, if the world should last so long. But for
somuch as in some calenders of ours it is reduced againe to the daie of
euerie change, it shall suffice to saie no more therof. The pope also
hath made a generall correction of the calender, wherein he hath reduced
it to the same that it was or should haue beene at the councell of Nice.
Howbeit as he hath abolished the vse of the golden number, so hath he
continued the epact, applieng it vnto such generall vse, as dooth now
serue both the turnes, whose reformation had also yer this time béene
admitted into England, if it had not procéeded from him, against whom
and all whose ordinances we haue so faithfullie sworne and set our
hands.</p>

<p>Certes the next omission is to be performed if all princes would agrée
thereto in the leape yeare that shall be about the yeare of Grace 1668:
if it shall please God that the world may last so long, and then may our
<span class="page"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>[Page 411]</span>
calender also stand without anie alteration as it dooth alreadie. By
this also it appeareth how the defect of our calender may be supplied
from the creation, wherein the first equinoctiall is séene higher toward
the beginning of March than Cæsars calender now extant dooth yéeld vnto
by seauen daies. For as in Cæsars time the true equinoctiall was pointed
out to happen (as Stadius also noteth) either vpon or about the
sixtéenth or seauentéenth of March, albeit the manifest apperance
thereof was not found vntill the fiue and twentith of that moneth in
their dials or by eie-sight: so at the beginning of the world the said
entrance of the sunne into the ram, must néeds fall out to be about the
twentith or one &amp; twentith of Aprill, as the calender now standeth, if I
faile not in my numbers. Aboue the yeare we haue no more parts of time,
that carie anie seuerall names with them, except you will affirme the
word age to be one, which is taken for a hundred yeares, and signifieth
in English so much as Seculum or Æuum dooth in Latine; neither is it
néedfull to remember that some of my countrimen doo reckon their times
not by years but by summers and winters, which is verie common among vs.
Wherefore to shut vp this chapiter withall, you shall haue a table of
the names of the daies of the wéeke, after the old Saxon and Scotish
maner, which I haue borowed from amongst our ancient writers, as I haue
perused their volumes.</p>

<small>OF OUR PRINCIPALL FAIRES AND MARKETS.</small><br />

CHAP. XV.</h3>

<p>I haue heretofore said sufficientlie of our faires, in the chapter of
fairs and markets; and now to performe my promise there made, I set
downe here so manie of our faires as I haue found out by mine owne
obseruation, and helpe of others in this behalfe. Certes it is
impossible for me to come by all, sith there is almost no towne in
England, but hath one or more such marts holden yearelie in the same,
although some of them (I must needs confesse) be scarse comparable to
Lowse faire, and little else bought or sold in them more than good
drinke, pies, and some pedlerie trash: wherefore it were no losse if
diuerse of them were abolished. Neither doo I see wherevnto this number
of paltrie fairs tendeth, so much as to the corruption of youth, who
(all other businesse set apart) must néeds repaire vnto them, whereby
they often spend not onelie the weeke daies, but also the Lords sabbaoth
in great vanitie and riot. But such hath béene the iniquitie of ancient
times. God grant therefore that ignorance being now abolished, and a
further insight into things growne into the minds of magistrates, these
old errors may be considered of, and so farre reformed, as that thereby
neither God may be dishonored, nor the common wealth of our countrie
anie thing diminished. In the meane time, take this table here insuing
in stead of a calender of the greatest, sith that I cannot, or at the
least wise care not to come by the names of the lesse, whose knowledge
cannot be so profitable to them that be farre off, as they are oft
<span class="page"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>[Page 412]</span>
preiudiciall to such as dwell néere hand to the places where they be

<small>OF OUR INNES AND THOROWFAIRES.</small><br />

CHAP. XVI.</h3>

<p>Those townes that we call thorowfaires haue great and sumptuous innes
builded in them, for the receiuing of such trauellers and strangers as
passe to and fro. The manner of harbouring wherein, is not like to that
of some other countries, in which the host or goodman of the house dooth
chalenge a lordlie authoritie ouer his ghests, but cleane otherwise,
sith euerie man may vse his inne as his owne house in England, and haue
for his monie how great or little varietie of vittels, and what other
seruice himselfe shall thinke expedient to call for. Our innes are also
verie well furnished with naperie, bedding, and tapisserie, especiallie
with naperie: for beside the linnen vsed at the tables, which is
commonlie washed dailie, is such and so much as belongeth vnto the
estate and calling of the ghest. Ech commer is sure to lie in cleane
sheets, wherein no man hath béene lodged since they came from the
landresse, or out of the water wherein they were last washed. If the
traueller haue an horsse, his bed dooth cost him nothing, but if he go
on foot he is sure to paie a penie for the same: but whether he be
horsseman or footman if his chamber be once appointed he may carie the
kaie with him, as of his owne house so long as he lodgeth there. If he
loose oughts whilest he abideth in the inne, the host is bound by a
generall custome to restore the damage, so that there is no greater
securitie anie where for trauellers than in the gretest ins of England.
Their horsses in like sort are walked, dressed and looked vnto by
certeine hostelers or hired seruants, appointed at the charges of the
goodman of the house, who in hope of extraodinarie reward will deale
verie diligentlie after outward appéerance in this their function and
calling. Herein neuerthelesse are manie of them blameworthie, in that
they doo not onelie deceiue the beast oftentimes of his allowance by
sundrie meanes, except their owners looke well to them; but also make
such packs with slipper merchants which hunt after preie (for what place
is sure from euill &amp; wicked persons) that manie an honest man is spoiled
of his goods as he trauelleth to and fro, in which feat also the
counsell of the tapsters or drawers of drinke, and chamberleins is not
seldome behind or wanting. Certes I beleeue not that chapman or
traueller in England is robbed by the waie without the knowledge of some
of them, for when he commeth into the inne, &amp; alighteth from his horsse,
the hostler forthwith is verie busie to take downe his budget or capcase
in the yard from his sadle bow, which he peiseth slilie in his hand to
féele the weight thereof: or if he misse of this pitch, when the ghest
<span class="page"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>[Page 415]</span>
hath taken vp his chamber, the chamberleine that looketh to the making
of the beds, will be sure to remooue it from the place where the owner
hath set it as if it were to set it more conuenientlie some where else,
whereby he getteth an inkling whether it be monie or other short wares,
&amp; therof giueth warning to such od ghests as hant the house and are of
his confederacie, to the vtter vndoing of manie an honest yeoman as he
iournieth by the waie. The tapster in like sort for his part dooth marke
his behauiour, and what plentie of monie he draweth when he paieth the
shot, to the like end: so that it shall be an hard matter to escape all
their subtile practises. Some thinke it a gay matter to commit their
budgets at their comming to the goodman of the house: but thereby they
oft bewraie themselues. For albeit their monie be safe for the time that
it is in his hands (for you shall not heare that a man is robbed in his
inne) yet after their departure the host can make no warrantise of the
same, sith his protection extendeth no further than the gate of his owne
house: and there cannot be a surer token vnto such as prie and watch for
those booties, than to sée anie ghest deliuer his capcase in such maner.
In all our innes we haue plentie of ale, béere, and sundrie kinds of
wine, and such is the capacitie of some of them that they are able to
lodge two hundred or three hundred persons, and their horsses at ease, &amp;
therto with a verie short warning make such prouision for their diet, as
to him that is vnacquainted withall may seeme to be incredible. Howbeit
of all in England there are no worse ins than in London, and yet manie
are there far better than the best that I haue heard of in anie forren
countrie, if all circumstances be dulie considered. But to leaue this &amp;
go in hand with my purpose. I will here set downe a table of the best
thorowfaires and townes of greatest trauell of England, in some of which
there are twelue or sixtéene such innes at the least, as I before did
speake of. And it is a world to sée how ech owner of them contendeth
with other for goodnesse of interteinement of their ghests, as about
finesse &amp; change of linnen, furniture of bedding, beautie of roomes,
seruice at the table, costlinesse of plate, strength of drinke, varietie
of wines, or well vsing of horsses. Finallie there is not so much
omitted among them as the gorgeousnes of their verie signes at their
doores, wherein some doo consume thirtie or fortie pounds, a méere
vanitie in mine opinion, but so vaine will they néeds be, and that not
onelie to giue some outward token of the inne kéepers welth, but also to
procure good ghests to the frequenting of their houses in hope there to
be well vsed. Lo here the table now at hand, for more of our innes I
shall not néed to speake.</p>

adioine the old thorowfaires ascribed to Antoninus, to the end that by
their conference the diligent reader may haue further consideration of
the same than my leisure will permit me. In setting foorth also thereof,
I haue noted such diuersitie of reading, as hath happened in the sight
of such written and printed copies, as I haue séene in my time.
Notwithstanding I must confesse the same to be much corrupted in the

<h3><a name="transcriber_note"></a>Transcriber's Note</h3>

<p>Elizabethan words and spellings have been retained (e.g.
'height' and 'heigth' are both used, sometimes in the same sentence;<br />
'hight' = 'known as, called, etc.').</p>

<p>Only obvious printer's errors have been corrected, as when a
letter seems to have been inverted ('n' for 'u').
The letters 'u' and 'v' are mostly interchanged; as, e.g.,
"in haruest time" and "vnder a bridge".
If a word or name did not fit the context,
it was researched, and corrections made, if necessary.</p>

<p>Macrons on vowels (&#257;, &#275;, &#299;, &#333;, &#363;) sometimes indicate that 'n' has been omitted from the word.
(Abbreviation in Mediæval manuscripts).</p>

<p>There are a few printer's errors in this edition, which
have been checked using the online 1587 edition (which itself is not without printing errors) as reference.</p>
<p>(http:// sceti.library.upenn.edu/sceti/PrintedBooksnew/index.cfm?TextID=holinshed_chronicle&amp;PagePosition=1).</p>
<p>Also used were the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), and online Middle English and Anglo-Saxon Dictionaries, as well as online Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Some, but by no means all, of 'ee' has the first 'e' marked
with an acute accent. This is not consistent.
Where the 'é' is obviously missing from the scan, it has not been added to the text.
This inconsistency in spelling and accents is an integral part of some very old books.</p>

<p>There are some instances of round brackets which have been
opened and not closed, or nested, with only one pair closed (or
closed, without having been opened). These have been retained
as such.</p>

<p>Some placenames may have changed with the passage of time.</p>

<p>Some damaged or missing punctuation has been restored, but the
punctuation in the lists at the end of Description III is as it appeared in the
scans, and in the online edition.</p>

<p>Page numbers have been added to the 'Description' Tables of Contents, for the convenience of the reader;
and Tables of Contents have been added to the beginning of this Volume.</p>

  <p>There are a few instances of repeated word 'too'.
  These have been retained, being probably the author's personal
  style:</p>

<ul class="none">
  <li>'is too too plaine'</li>
  <li>'being too too much'</li>
  <li>'haue too too manie'.</li>
  <li>'too too lewd'</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Page 43: "practise and put in vre within your realme and kingdome."</p>
  <p>'vre', or 'ure', is an antique word, which survives in the
  modern word 'inure'.</p>

  <p>(Ure) n. [OE. ure, OF. oevre, ovre, ouvre, work, F. &oelig;uvre, L.
  opera. cf. Inure .] Use; practice; exercise. [Obs.] (Ure), v.
  t. To use; to exercise; to inure; to accustom by practice.
  [Obs.] (Webster's online dictionary, 1913 edition).</p>

 <p>Page 67: 'barnacle'; 'barnacls'; 'barnacles' ... there were no spelling
conventions in Holinshed's time. 'barnacls' matches 1587 ed.</p>

<p>Page 252: 'hanting' could mean 'haunting', or 'frequenting'.</p>

<p>"... they ruffle and roist it out, excéeding in apparell, and hanting
 riotous companie (which draweth them from their bookes vnto an other
 trade.)"</p>

<p>Page 255: 'Philip' is an abbreviation for Queen Philippa (of Hainault).</p>

<p>Page 347: "<span class="leftnote">Gipping, of going vp to anie place.</span>
 Chipping Walden, of the Saxon word &#7545;ipping (or ghipping)
 uses the insular 'g' (&#7545;), variant of (lowercase) yogh (&#541;).</p>

<p>(http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_G)</p>

<p>Page 358: 'cuphar'.</p>

<p class="ind">"Of all the elms that euer I saw, those in the south
side of Douer court, in Essex néere Harwich are the most notable, for
they grow (I meane) in crooked maner, that they are almost apt for
nothing else but nauie timber, great ordinance, and béetels: and such
thereto is their naturall qualitie, that being vsed in the said behalfe,
they continue longer, and more long than anie the like trées in
whatsoeuer parcell else of this land, without cuphar, shaking, or cleauing, as I find."</p>

<p class="ind">Possibly from 'ceorfan' to cut, cut down. (coppice?)</p>

<p>Page 386: 'Bratius' is probably 'Gratius'.</p>

<p>"Bratius De venatione, 1/386 - probably Faliscus Gratius, De venatione, 1534."</p>
